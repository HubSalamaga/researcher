"Nutritional status and gene polymorphisms of one-carbon metabolism confer a well-known interaction that in pregnant women may affect embryo viability and the health of the newborn. Folate metabolism directly impacts nucleotide synthesis and methylation, which is of increasing interest in the reproductive medicine field. Studies assessing the genetic influence of folate metabolism on IVF treatments have currently been performed in women using their own oocytes. Most of these patients seeking to have a child or undergoing IVF treatments are advised to preventively intake folate supplies that restore known metabolic imbalances, but the treatments could lead to the promotion of specific enzymes in specific women, depending on their genetic variance. In the present study, we assess the influence of candidate gene variants related to folate metabolism, such as Serine Hydroxymethyltransferase 1 SHMT1 (rs1979276 and rs1979277), Betaine-Homocysteine S-Methyltransferase BHMT (rs3733890), Methionine synthase reductase MTRR (rs1801394), Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase MTHFR (rs1801131 and rs1801133), methionine synthase MTR (rs12749581), ATP Binding Cassette Subfamily B Member 1 ABCB1 (rs1045642) and folate receptor alpha FOLR1 (rs2071010) on the success of IVF treatment performed in women being recipients of donated oocytes. The implication of such gene variants seems to have no direct impact on pregnancy consecution after IVF; however, several gene variants could influence pregnancy loss events or pregnancy maintenance, as consequence of folic acid fortification.", 0.9, 0.2, "PMC9569987"
"Thrombophilic gene polymorphism is known to be a risk factor for recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL), but few studies have confirmed a possible role of thrombophilic genes polymorphism in RPL risk. This study was conducted to understand the relationship of the mutations of some thrombophilia-associated gene polymorphism (heterozygous/homozygous) with RPL. We compared patients with 2 abortions to patients with 3 or more abortions among Turkish women. Material/Methods In this study, patients previously diagnosed with habitual abortus at Obstetrics and Gynecology outpatient clinics in Turkey between 2012 and 2016 were included. In their peripheral blood, we detected factor V Leiden H1299R, prothrombin G20210A, MTHFR C677T, MTHFR A1298C, PAI-1 4G/5G, and PAI-1 4G/4G gene mutations. Results In this study, we have observed statistically meaningful data (P<0.01) related to the relationship between RPL and thrombophilia-associated gene polymorphisms such as heterozygous factor V Leiden H1299R, heterozygous prothrombin G20210A, PAI-1 4G/5G, and PAI-1 4G/4G. Conclusions We found that diagnosis of thrombophilic genes polymorphism is useful to determine the causes of RPL, recognizing that this multifactorial disease can also be influenced by various acquired factors, including reproduction-associated risk factors and prolonged immobilization.", 0.9, 0.5, "PMC6045916"
"Background Whether adiponectin (ADIPOQ) polymorphisms are associated with the risk of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) remain controversial. Therefore, we performed this study to better explore correlations between ADIPOQ polymorphisms and PCOS risk. Methods Literature retrieve was conducted in PubMed, Medline and Embase. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Results Eighteen studies were enrolled for analyses. Pooled overall analyses showed that rs1501299 polymorphism was significantly associated with PCOS risk (recessive model: p = 0.02, OR = 0.77, 95%CI 0.62–0.95; allele model: p = 0.001, OR = 1.15, 95%CI 1.06–1.26). Further subgroup analyses according to ethnicity of participants revealed that rs1501299 and rs2241766 polymorphisms were both significantly correlated with PCOS risk in Caucasians. In addition, rs1501299 polymorphism was also significantly correlated with PCOS risk in East Asians. Conclusions Our findings indicated that rs1501299 and rs2241766 polymorphisms might serve as genetic biomarkers of PCOS in certain ethnicities.", 0.95, 1, "PMC6278103"
"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common, highly heritable complex disorder of unknown aetiology characterized by hyperandrogenism, chronic anovulation and defects in glucose homeostasis. Increased luteinizing hormone relative to follicle-stimulating hormone secretion, insulin resistance and developmental exposure to androgens are hypothesized to play a causal role in PCOS. Here we map common genetic susceptibility loci in European ancestry women for the National Institutes of Health PCOS phenotype, which confers the highest risk for metabolic morbidities, as well as reproductive hormone levels. Three loci reach genome-wide significance in the case–control meta-analysis, two novel loci mapping to chr 8p32.1 and chr 11p14.1, and a chr 9q22.32 locus previously found in Chinese PCOS. The same chr 11p14.1 SNP, rs11031006, in the region of the follicle-stimulating hormone B polypeptide (FSHB) gene strongly associates with PCOS diagnosis and luteinizing hormone levels. These findings implicate neuroendocrine changes in disease pathogenesis.", 0.95, 1, "PMC4557132"
"Objective: Endometriosis has been considered an epigenetic disease. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in genes encoding enzymes of the folate and choline metabolism may affect DNA methyltransferase activity. Study design: We studied 16 SNPs in 12 folate and choline metabolism genes, including BHMT (rs7356530 and rs3733890), BHMT2 (rs625879), CBS (844ins68), CHDH (rs893363 and rs2289205), CHKA (rs7928739), MTHFD1 (rs2236225), MTHFR (rs1801133), MTR (rs1805087), MTRR (rs1801394), PCYT1A (rs712012 and rs7639752), PEMT (rs4244593 and rs4646406) and TCN (rs1801198) in one hundred and sixty-three infertile women with minimal endometriosis and one hundred and fifty fertile women. Results: There were no significant differences between genotype and allele frequencies of these gene variants in infertile women with endometriosis (n=163) and controls (n=150). The lowest, but not statistically significant, p values of the trend test were observed for the CBS 844ins68 and MTR rs1805087 (ptrend=0.0527 and ptrend=0.0771, respectively) polymorphisms. However, the exhaustive multifactor dimensionality reduction analysis revealed an epistatic interaction between rs1801133 of MTHFR and rs4244593 of PEMT in endometriosis-associated infertility (p=0.0240). Conclusions: Our results showed moderate evidence for the contribution of SNPs located in genes encoding folate and choline metabolism enzymes to infertility in women with endometriosis.", 0.95, 0.55, "21429654"
"Objective To present the development of the first custom gene panel for the diagnosis of male and female infertility in Latin America. Methods We developed a next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel that assesses genes associated with infertility. The panel targeted exons and their flanking regions. Selected introns in the CFTR gene were also included. The FMR1 gene and Y chromosome microdeletions were analyzed with other recommended methodologies. An in-house developed bioinformatic pipeline was applied for the interpretation of the results. Clear infertility phenotypes, idiopathic infertility, and samples with known pathogenic variants were evaluated. Results A total of 75 genes were selected based on female (primary ovarian insufficiency, risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, recurrent pregnancy loss, oocyte maturation defects, and embryo development arrest) and male conditions (azoospermia, severe oligospermia, asthenozoospermia, and teratozoospermia). The panel designed was used to assess 25 DNA samples. Two of the variants found were classified as pathogenic and enable the diagnosis of a woman with secondary amenorrhea and a man with oligoasthenoteratozoospermia. Targeted NGS assay metrics resulted in a mean of 180X coverage, with more than 98% of the bases covered ≥20X. Conclusion Our custom gene sequencing panel designed for the diagnosis of male and female infertility caused by genetic defects revealed the underlying genetic cause of some cases of infertility. The panel will allow us to develop more precise approaches in assisted reproduction.", 0.95, 0.55, "PMC7169920"
"Introduction: The aim of the study was to evaluate the contribution of genetic variants determining inherited thrombophilia to recurrent miscarriage (RM) in the Polish population. The following polymorphisms were analyzed: 1691G>A, 1328T>C of coagulation factor V, 20210G>A of coagulation factor II, R353Q (11496G>A) of coagulation factor VII, 667C>T, 1298A>C, 1793G>A of MTHFR. Material and methods: A total of 359 women with ≥ 2 subsequent recurrent miscarriages (303 < 13 weeks of gestation (w.g.) and 56 between 13-22 w.g.) and 400 healthy controls were included in the study. Frequency of the genetic polymor-phisms was determined with the PCR/RFLP method. Results: Higher frequency of the 20210GA genotype was found in the RM < 13 w.g. (2.97 vs. 1.50% in controls, OR = 2.01, ns) and the RM 13-22 w.g. (5.36 vs. 1.50% in controls, OR = 3.72, p = 0.09) subgroups. Statistically significantly higher frequency of the 11496GA genotype was noted in controls as compared to the RM 13-22 w.g. subgroup (10.71 vs. 23.00% in controls, OR = 0.40, p = 0.02). Statistically significantly higher frequency of the 1793GA genotype was observed in the RM < 13 w.g. subgroup as compared to controls (12.21 vs. 7.75% in controls, OR = 1.66, p = 0.03). No significant correlations were found as far as the rest of the analyzed polymorphisms are concerned. Conclusions: The obtained results suggest that the 1793G>A MTHFR, R353Q (11496G>A) factor VII gene and the 20210G>A factor II gene polymorphisms play a role in the etiology of RM in the Polish population.", 0.95, 0.6, "28819944"
"Background: Although the precise pathophysiology that leads to placental abruption is unknown, there is evidence supporting a genetic etiology. Methods: We searched PubMed and systematically reviewed all case-control studies that investigated the association between genetic variants and placental abruption. Pooled genetic risks were estimated using fixed and random effects odds ratios. Results: Twenty-two articles, examining a total of 14 gene polymorphisms were identified. Seven polymorphisms (F5 Arg506Gln, F5 Met385Thr, F2 G20210A, MTHFR A1298C, MTHFD1 Arg653Gln, NOS3 Glu298Asp, AGT Met235Thr) show significant association in individual studies. Six of the 7 (all except F5Met385Thr) were studied more than once and we therefore included them in our meta-analyses. A positive association under the dominant model was found for the F5 Arg506Gln and F2 G20210A polymorphisms. The random-effects odds ratio for the F5 Arg506Gln polymorphism was 3.4 (95% confidence interval = 1.4-8.3) and the fixed-effects odds ratio for the F2 G20210A polymorphism was 6.7 (3.2-13). Conclusion: Considering the multifactorial etiology of abruption and the relatively small numbers of studies and participants, this review provides only the first clues of possible genetic causes. Larger case-control studies that include gene-gene and gene-environment interactions may help to elucidate the genetics of placental abruption further.", 0.95, 1, "18277167"
"Background Key reactions in folate-mediated single-carbon metabolism are regulated by folate cycle enzymes. Violations of the folate cycle may be associated with the occurrence of fetal growth restriction (FGR) in pregnant women. Objective To study the relationship between polymorphisms of folate cycle genes in the mother with the development of FGR. Materials and Methods In this case-control study, 122 pregnant women with FGR and 243 pregnant women with normal newborn weight were enrolled. The polymorphic loci of folate cycle genes including rs1805087 5-methylenetetrahydrofolate (MTR) and rs1979277 serine hydroxymethyl transferase (SHMT1) were examined. The study of polymorphisms was carried out through the TaqMan probe detection method using polymerase chain reaction. Logistic regression was used to analyze the associations of the polymorphisms. Results It was established that the T allele rs1979277 of the SHMT1 gene was correlated with the development of FGR within the framework of the allelic (OR = 1.67, 95% CI 1.20-2.33, p perm < 0.01), additive (OR = 1.69, 95% CI 1.20-2.37, p perm < 0.01), dominant (OR = 1.81, 95% CI 1.15-2.87, p perm = 0.01) and recessive (OR = 2.34, 95% CI 1.15-4.73, p perm = 0.01) models. The association of the G rs1805087 allele of the MTR gene with the occurrence of FGR was also identified following the recessive model (OR = 3.01, 95% CI 1.05-8.68, p perm = 0.04). Conclusion Our results indicated that maternal polymorphic loci rs1979277 SHMT1 and rs1805087 MTR may be associated with the development of FGR.", 0.95, 0.4, "PMC8792379"
"Epidemiological studies have suggested that the condition of recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) may be multifactorial, with both genetic predisposition and environmental factors potentially involved in its pathogenesis. The aim of this study is to elucidate the associations between maternal folate, alcohol and energy metabolism-related gene polymorphisms and the risk of RPL. This case-control study, which involved 116 cases with two or more instances of RPL and 306 fertile controls, was performed in the city of Sapporo, Japan. The associations between eight single nucleotide polymorphisms of folate, alcohol and energy metabolism-related genes [methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase (MTR), 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase reductase (MTRR), alcohol dehydrogenase 1B (ADH1B), aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2), beta-3-adrenergic receptor (ADRB3) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG)], and RPL were assessed. Without consideration of cigarette smoking or alcohol use, the risk of RPL significantly decreased in women with the MTHFR rs1801133 TT, MTR rs1805087 AG or ALDH2 rs671 AA genotype (P < 0.05). The risk of RPL associated with cigarette smoking and alcohol use decreased significantly in women carrying the MTHFR rs1801133 T allele [odds ratio (OR), 0.51; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.27-0.95]. Similarly, the risk of RPL significantly decreased in women carrying the MTR rs1805087 G allele (OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.23-0.85). Our findings suggest that maternal gene polymorphisms related to folate metabolism may decrease the risk of RPL. Molecular epidemiological studies are needed to unequivocally elucidate the multifactorial effects of both genetic and environmental factors on human fecundity.", 0.95, 0.6, PMID: 25102261
"Aim To investigate association of factor V Leiden, prothrombin G20210A, MTHFR C677T and PAI-1 4G/5G polymorphisms with recurrent pregnancy loss in Bosnian women. Methods A total of 60 women with two or more consecutive miscarriages before 20 weeks of gestation with the same partners and without history of known causes or recurrent pregnancy loss were included. A control group included 80 healthy women who had one or more successful pregnancies without history of any complication which could be associated with miscarriages. Genotyping of factor V Leiden, prothrombin G20210A, MTHFR C677T and PAI-1 4G/5G polymorphisms were performed by polymerase chain reaction/restriction fragments length polymorphism method (PCR/RFLP). Results Both factor V Leiden and MTHFR C677T polymorphisms were significantly associated with recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) in Bosnian women while prothrombin G20210A and PAI-1 4G/5G polymorphisms did not show strongly significant association. Conclusion The presence of thrombophilic polymorphisms may predispose women to recurrent pregnancy loss. Future investigation should be addressed in order to find when carriers of those mutations, polymorphisms should be treated with anticoagulant therapy.", 0.95, 0.55, PMID: 29703881
"Objective: The etiology of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) has not yet been fully explained. Several studies suggested an association between two single nucleotide polymorphisms (T45G and G276T) of the ADIPOQ gene that encodes for the hormone adiponectin and PCOS susceptibility. Hence, we performed a meta-analysis to investigate the relationship of the two further. Materials and methods: Literature search was conducted in PubMed up to June 22, 2018, for related publications written in English. Selected data were extracted from the included studies and was subjected to analysis using Review Manager 5.3. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed and pooled from the resulting studies. Subgroup analysis by ethnicity was also performed. Results: Overall analysis showed that women with the G276T polymorphism have reduced susceptibility to PCOS (OR: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.60-0.78; PA < 0.001). While no significant association was observed for the T45G polymorphism (OR: 1.07; 95% CI: 0.93-1.24; PA = 0.34). Subgroup analysis, on the other hand, showed significant associations among East Asians (OR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.57-0.82; PA < 0.001) for the G276T association. Conclusion: Results of this meta-analysis suggests that women with the G276T polymorphism are less likely to develop PCOS. However, more studies are needed to confirm the claims of this meta-analysis.", 0.95, 1, "31122534"
"Kallmann’s syndrome (KS) is characterized by the association of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and anosmia or hyposmia. Genetic defects have been observed throughout the KAL1 gene, located on the Xp22.3 region, in less than 50% of the patients. We report the molecular study of the KAL1 gene in 12 males with KS. PCR of the 14 exons of the KAL1 gene was performed on genomic DNA. PCR products of all exons were purified and sequenced. Three novel genetic defects were found. One patient exhibited a complete deletion of exon 5. The second presented a duplication of nucleotides 158–168; this insertion causes a termination codon (TGA) within the same exon. The third presented a mutation in exon 6, in which codon 262 changes from arginine to a stop codon. In the remaining nine individuals, no mutations were found. Three previously reported polymorphic changes were also documented. The deletion of exon 5 occurs within the region encoding the first fibronectin type III-like repeat of the KAL1 protein, this being the first KS patient who exhibits a complete deletion of a single exon of the KAL1 gene. The duplication of nucleotides in exon 1 is located in the conserved cysteine-rich N-terminal region that corresponds to the whey acidic protein motif, affecting the KAL1 protein either by interrupting the normal transcription or stopping the translation at the stop codon. The last novel mutation, a stop codon in exon 6, is located within the region encoding the first fibronectin type III-like repeat of the KAL1 protein. The absence of mutations in the majority of patients suggests the possibility of the existence of other genes involved or that in certain individuals the presence of various polymorphisms within the KAL1 gene could predispose to disease, as has been demonstrated in other pathological entities", 0.75, 0.4, "12050219"
"We sought to verify whether variation in the promoter of the gene encoding placental anticoagulant protein annexin A5 (ANXA5) represents a risk factor for recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL). Sequence analysis of 70 German RPL patients, all known to carry neither factor V Leiden nor a prothrombin mutation, revealed four consecutive nucleotide substitutions in the ANXA5 promoter, which were transmitted as a joint haplotype (M2). Reporter gene assays revealed that M2 reduces the in vitro activity of the ANXA5 promoter to 37-42% of the normal level. The possible relationship between M2 and RPL was evaluated by comparing RPL patients with two independent control groups recruited from the registry of the Institut für Humangenetik in Münster and the PopGen biobank in Kiel, respectively. Carriers of M2 were found to exhibit a > 2-fold higher RPL risk than non-carriers (odds ratio, 2.42; 95% confidence interval, 1.27-4.58) when using unselected controls (PopGen) and an almost 4-fold higher risk when using the Münster 'super-controls', i.e. women with successful pregnancies and no previous history of pregnancy losses (odds ratio, 3.88; 95% confidence interval, 1.98-7.54). This statistically significant association should facilitate the development of improved prognostic algorithms for RPL, involving a more precise assessment of individual disease risks, and provide a guide to offering adequate therapies where relevant.", 0.75, 0.55, "17339269"
"Context: Prior studies showed that Axl /Tyro3 null mice have delayed first estrus and abnormal cyclicity due to developmental defects in GnRH neuron migration and survival. Objective: The objective of the study was to test whether the absence of Axl would alter reproductive function in mice and that mutations in AXL are present in patients with Kallmann syndrome (KS) or normosmic idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (nIHH). Design and Setting: The sexual maturation of Axl null mice was examined. The coding region of AXL was sequenced in 104 unrelated, carefully phenotyped KS or nIHH subjects. Frequency of mutations was compared with other causes of GnRH deficiency. Functional assays were performed on the detected mutations. Results: Axl null mice demonstrated delay in first estrus and the interval between vaginal opening and first estrus. Three missense AXL mutations (p.L50F, p.S202C, and p.Q361P) and one intronic variant 6 bp upstream from the start of exon 5 (c.586-6 C>T) were identified in two KS and 2 two nIHH subjects. Comparison of the frequencies of AXL mutations with other putative causes of idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism confirmed they are rare variants. Testing of the c.586-6 C>T mutation revealed no abnormal splicing. Surface plasmon resonance analysis of the p.L50F, p.S202C, and p.Q361P mutations showed no altered Gas6 ligand binding. In contrast, GT1-7 GnRH neuronal cells expressing p.S202C or p.Q361P demonstrated defective ligand dependent receptor processing and importantly aberrant neuronal migration. In addition, the p.Q361P showed defective ligand independent chemotaxis. Conclusions: Functional consequences of AXL sequence variants in patients with idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism support the importance of AXL and the Tyro3, Axl, Mer (TAM) family in reproductive development.", 0.85, 0.5, "PMC3973777"
