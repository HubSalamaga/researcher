Abstract,ID
"RNA binding proteins play essential roles in coordinating germline gene expression and development in all organisms. Here, we report that loss of ADR-2, a member of the Adenosine DeAminase acting on RNA (ADAR) family of RNA binding proteins and the sole adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing enzyme in C. elegans, can improve fertility in multiple genetic backgrounds. First, we show that loss of RNA editing by ADR-2 restores normal embryo production to subfertile animals that transgenically express a vitellogenin (yolk protein) fusion to green fluorescent protein. Using this phenotype, a high-throughput screen was designed to identify RNA binding proteins that when depleted yield synthetic phenotypes with loss of adr-2. The screen uncovered a genetic interaction between ADR-2 and SQD-1, a member of the heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) family of RNA binding proteins. Microscopy, reproductive assays, and high-throughput sequencing reveal that sqd-1 is essential for the onset of oogenesis and oogenic gene expression in young adult animals, and that loss of adr-2 can counteract the effects of loss of sqd-1 on gene expression and rescue the switch from spermatogenesis to oogenesis. Together, these data demonstrate that ADR-2 can contribute to the suppression of fertility and suggest novel roles for both RNA editing-dependent and independent mechanisms in regulating embryogenesis.",10635048
"Tumor biomarkers, the substances which are produced by tumors or the body’s responses to tumors during tumorigenesis and progression, have been demonstrated to possess critical and encouraging value in screening and early diagnosis, prognosis prediction, recurrence detection, and therapeutic efficacy monitoring of cancers. Over the past decades, continuous progress has been made in exploring and discovering novel, sensitive, specific, and accurate tumor biomarkers, which has significantly promoted personalized medicine and improved the outcomes of cancer patients, especially advances in molecular biology technologies developed for the detection of tumor biomarkers. Herein, we summarize the discovery and development of tumor biomarkers, including the history of tumor biomarkers, the conventional and innovative technologies used for biomarker discovery and detection, the classification of tumor biomarkers based on tissue origins, and the application of tumor biomarkers in clinical cancer management. In particular, we highlight the recent advancements in biomarker-based anticancer-targeted therapies which are emerging as breakthroughs and promising cancer therapeutic strategies. We also discuss limitations and challenges that need to be addressed and provide insights and perspectives to turn challenges into opportunities in this field. Collectively, the discovery and application of multiple tumor biomarkers emphasized in this review may provide guidance on improved precision medicine, broaden horizons in future research directions, and expedite the clinical classification of cancer patients according to their molecular biomarkers rather than organs of origin.",11102923
"Miscarriage is a frustrating complication of pregnancy that is common among women of reproductive age. Insufficient decidualization which not only impairs embryo implantation but disturbs fetomaternal immune-tolerance, has been widely regarded as a major cause of miscarriage; however, the underlying mechanisms resulting in decidual impairment are largely unknown. With informed consent, decidual tissue from patients with spontaneous abortion or normal pregnant women was collected to detect the expression profile of UCHL1. Human endometrial stromal cells (HESCs) were used to explore the roles of UCHL1 in decidualization and dNK modulation, as well as the mechanisms involved. C57/BL6 female mice (7–10 weeks old) were used to construct pregnancy model or artificially induced decidualization model to evaluate the effect of UCHL1 on mice decidualization and pregnancy outcome. The Ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCHL1), as a deubiquitinating enzyme, was significantly downregulated in decidua from patients with miscarriage, along with impaired decidualization and decreased dNKs. Blockage of UCHL1 led to insufficient decidualization and resultant decreased expression of cytokines CXCL12, IL-15, TGF-β which were critical for generation of decidual NK cells (dNKs), whereas UCHL1 overexpression enhanced decidualization accompanied by increase in dNKs. Mechanistically, the promotion of UCHL1 on decidualization was dependent on its deubiquitinating activity, and intervention of UCHL1 inhibited the activation of JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway, resulting in aberrant decidualization and decreased production of cytokines associated with dNKs modulation. Furthermore, we found that inhibition of UCHL1 also disrupted the decidualization in mice and eventually caused adverse pregnancy outcome. UCHL1 plays significant roles in decidualization and dNKs modulation during pregnancy in both humans and mice. Its deficiency indicates a poor pregnancy outcome due to defective decidualization, making UCHL1 a potential target for the diagnosis and treatment of miscarriage.

"We present a unique case of hypokalemic thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (TPP) in an adolescent girl in North America. TPP is a rare but dangerous complication seen in thyrotoxic patients characterized by hypokalemia and acute proximal symmetric lower-extremity weakness. It is an especially rare phenomenon in pediatrics, with roughly 20 case reports described in adolescents worldwide; the majority are male. Our patient is a 14-year-old Asian girl with biochemical hyperandrogenism and known Graves disease who presented with an acute episode of lower-extremity weakness after eating a carbohydrate-rich meal. Laboratory workup revealed hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, an undetectable thyrotropin, and hyperthyroxinemia. Electrolyte derangements responded well to supplementation, and the muscle weakness resolved with electrolyte normalization. Following improvement in thyroid function, the patient underwent thyroidectomy for definitive management of Graves disease. As TPP is potentially exacerbated by higher androgen and insulin levels, we suspect that with increasing rates of obesity and polycystic ovary syndrome, the incidence of TPP among adolescents may increase. It is therefore critically important that there is awareness and recognition of this serious diagnosis among all health care providers.",11104527
"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive brain tumor in adults. To identify genes differentially required for the viability of GBM stem-like cells (GSCs), we performed functional genomic lethality screens comparing GSCs and control human neural stem cells. Among top-scoring hits in a subset of GBM cells was the F-box-containing gene FBXO42, which was also predicted to be essential in ∼15% of cell lines derived from a broad range of cancers. Mechanistic studies revealed that, in sensitive cells, FBXO42 activity prevents chromosome alignment defects, mitotic cell cycle arrest and cell death. The cell cycle arrest, but not the cell death, triggered by FBXO42 inactivation could be suppressed by brief exposure to a chemical inhibitor of Mps1, a key spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) kinase. FBXO42’s cancer-essential function requires its F-box and Kelch domains, which are necessary for FBXO42’s substrate recognition and targeting by SCF (SKP1–CUL1–F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complex. However, none of FBXO42’s previously proposed targets, including ING4, p53 and RBPJ, were responsible for the observed phenotypes. Instead, our results suggest that FBOX42 alters the activity of one or more proteins that perturb chromosome–microtubule dynamics in cancer cells, which in turn leads to induction of the SAC and cell death.",11106029
"Infertility is defined as the failure to achieve pregnancy after one year of unprotected intercourse within a marital relationship. Approximately 10%–15% of couples worldwide experience infertility issues, with nearly half of these cases attributed to male factors. Among men with unexplained infertility, genetic mutations have been identified as a potential cause. Studies have indicated that mutations affecting the function of the protein encoded by the ACTL9 gene may play a role in male infertility. The purpose of this research was to identify mutations in the ACTL9 gene associated with male infertility in a sample of 40 infertile men with unknown causes. Genomic DNA extraction and PCR amplification were carried out on samples from each individual. The genetic material was then analyzed using Sanger sequencing, followed by bioinformatics and segregation analysis to determine the potential effects of the observed variations. A novel genetic variant, c.376G>A (p.Glu126Lys), was identified in an infertile male individual, representing a previously unreported finding that was validated through segregation analyses. This specific variant induces a change from glutamate to lysine at the amino acid level by replacing the nucleotide G with A in the genomic DNA sequence, consequently impacting the secondary structure and function of the protein. The conclusive analysis of the procedure indicated that this alteration has the potential to interfere with the process of fertilization, ultimately resulting in the complete failure of fertilization (TFF) and causing male infertility.",11106586
"Immunotherapy represented by anti-PD-(L)1 and anti-CTLA-4 inhibitors has revolutionized cancer treatment, but challenges related to resistance and toxicity still remain. Due to the advancement of immuno-oncology, an increasing number of novel immunoregulatory targets and mechanisms are being revealed, with relevant therapies promising to improve clinical immunotherapy in the foreseeable future. Therefore, comprehending the larger picture is important. In this review, we analyze and summarize the current landscape of preclinical and translational mechanistic research, drug development, and clinical trials that brought about next-generation pharmacological immunoregulatory anti-cancer agents and drug candidates beyond classical immune checkpoint inhibitors. Along with further clarification of cancer immunobiology and advances in antibody engineering, agents targeting additional inhibitory immune checkpoints, including LAG-3, TIM-3, TIGIT, CD47, and B7 family members are becoming an important part of cancer immunotherapy research and discovery, as are structurally and functionally optimized novel anti-PD-(L)1 and anti-CTLA-4 agents and agonists of co-stimulatory molecules of T cells. Exemplified by bispecific T cell engagers, newly emerging bi-specific and multi-specific antibodies targeting immunoregulatory molecules can provide considerable clinical benefits. Next-generation agents also include immune epigenetic drugs and cytokine-based therapeutics. Cell therapies, cancer vaccines, and oncolytic viruses are not covered in this review. This comprehensive review might aid in further development and the fastest possible clinical adoption of effective immuno-oncology modalities for the benefit of patients.",11109181
"The presence of cancer cachexia is a significant adverse prognostic indicator in patients with malignant tumors. Cancer cachexia is a multifactorial syndrome characterized by a constant loss of skeletal muscles with or without a loss of weight, leading to immune dysfunction. We performed a retrospective study to investigate the influence of cachexia on the immunotherapy efficacy and prognosis for malignant tumors of the digestive system. The present study adopts a cross‐sectional design. The prognosis data of patients with advanced cancer of the digestive system who received immunotherapy from September 2021 to December 2022 were analyzed. Cachexia was calculated using the change of the area of the psoas major muscle (PMMA) or the weight. We measured the change at the beginning of immunotherapy and at least 2 cycles afterward. The participants were categorized into the cachexia group and control group based on the evaluation criteria. Kaplan–Meier and Log‐rank methods were used for survival analysis. Cox proportional hazard model as a method to assess the contribution of different clinical factors to overall survival (OS) and progression‐free survival (PFS). A total number of 98 patients, including esophageal carcinoma (4, 4%), gastric (36, 37%), colorectal (51, 52%), and other cancer types (7, 7%), were enrolled. Fifty‐four patients were diagnosed with non‐cancer cachexia, and the cancer cachexia group included 44 patients. The median PFS in the cachexia group was shorter than that in the control group (130 days vs. 212 days). Their difference was not significant (p = .321). The survival rate of the patients without cachexia was longer than of those with cachexia (p = .027). The level of albumin and the number of metastatic organs were related to PFS (p = .020, p = .029). The albumin level was significantly associated with the OS of patients (p = .003). The presence of cachexia was significantly associated with poor OS in patients with malignant tumors of the digestive system who received immunotherapy, not with PFS or the response to immunotherapy.",11110103
"Patients with spinal cord injury have a relatively high risk for bladder cancer and often complicated with bladder cancer in advanced stages, and the degree of aggressiveness of malignancy is high. Most of the literature is based on disease clinical features while, our study reviews the clinical characteristics and molecular mechanisms of spinal cord injury patients with bladder cancer, so that it might help clinicians better recognize and manage these patients. We searched PubMed, Web of Science and Embase, using retrieval type like (“Neurogenic Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction” OR “Spinal cord injury” OR “Spinal Cord Trauma”) AND (“bladder cancer” OR “bladder neoplasm” OR “bladder carcinoma” OR “Urinary Bladder Neoplasms” OR “Bladder Tumor”). In Web of Science, the retrieval type was searched as “Topic”, and in PubMed and Embase, as “All Field”. The methodological quality of eligible studies and their risk of bias were assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. This article is registered in PROSPERO with the CBD number: CRD42024508514. In WOS, we searched 219 related papers, in PubMed, 122 and in Embase, 363. Thus, a total of 254 articles were included after passing the screening, within a time range between 1960 and 2023. A comprehensive analysis of the data showed that the mortality and incidence rates of bladder cancer in spinal cord injury patients were higher than that of the general population, and the most frequent pathological type was squamous cell carcinoma. In parallel to long-term urinary tract infection and indwelling catheterization, the role of molecules such as NO, MiR 1949 and Rb 1. was found to be crucial pathogenetically. This review highlights the risk of bladder cancer in SCI patients, comprehensively addressing the clinical characteristics and related molecular mechanisms. However, given that there are few studies on the molecular mechanisms of bladder cancer in spinal cord injury, further research is needed to expand the understanding of the disease.

"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic and recurrent condition affecting the gastrointestinal tract. Disturbed gut microbiota and abnormal bile acid (BA) metabolism are notable in IBD, suggesting a bidirectional relationship. Specifically, the diversity of the gut microbiota influences BA composition, whereas altered BA profiles can disrupt the microbiota. IBD patients often exhibit increased primary bile acid and reduced secondary bile acid concentrations due to a diminished bacteria population essential for BA metabolism. This imbalance activates BA receptors, undermining intestinal integrity and immune function. Consequently, targeting the microbiota-BA axis may rectify these disturbances, offering symptomatic relief in IBD. Here, the interplay between gut microbiota and bile acids (BAs) is reviewed, with a particular focus on the role of gut microbiota in mediating bile acid biotransformation, and contributions of the gut microbiota-BA axis to IBD pathology to unveil potential novel therapeutic avenues for IBD.",11110704
"We report the case of a 5-year-old boy diagnosed with congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 11-hydroxylase deficiency, revealed by disorders of sex development (DSD) and acute pulmonary edema due to severe hypertension. We considered the diagnosis based on biological and radiological examinations. The sociocultural background and the delayed diagnosis had a significant impact on the therapeutic decisions. All babies should be screened for 11 beta-hydroxylase deficiency, there should be specialized and interdisciplinary medical centers, and early detection is essential to avoiding serious complications of this disease.",11110861
"Dyskeratosis congenita (DKC) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by lacy reticular skin hyperpigmentation, bone marrow failure, nail dystrophy, and oral leukoplakia. To the best of our knowledge, only around 200 cases were reported in the medical literature, and in this report, we present another distinctive case from Syria. This case report describes a male patient with generalized reticular pigmentation and abnormal nails since childhood. The patient reported a history of recurrent urethral stenosis and corneal density. Dermoscopic examination revealed pigmented lines arranged in a netlike pattern. Histopathological findings were nonspecific. Hematological values were unremarkable. A contrast CT scan revealed changes in the bladder wall. The final diagnosis of Dyskeratosis Congenita was made based on the clinical criteria. This disorder can present with additional cutaneous manifestations and systemic complications. Treatment are generally prescribed to maintain bone marrow function, based on the fact that it is the major cause of death. Regular monitoring and screening for associated conditions are recommended.",11110863
"Spermatozoa cryopreservation has been practiced for decades and is a very useful technique for long-term preservation of sperm fertility. The capability for semen cryopreservation varies across species, seasons, latitudes, and even for different ejaculates from the same animal. This article summarizes research results on sperm cryotolerance biomarkers in several species, focusing on three areas: spermatozoa cryotolerance biomarkers, seminal plasma proteins cryotolerance biomarkers, and other cryotolerance biomarkers. We discovered that sperm cryoresistance biomarkers are primarily related to sperm plasma membrane stability, the presence of antioxidant substances in sperm or seminal plasma, sperm cell energy metabolism, water and small molecule transport channels in the sperm plasma membrane, and antistress substances in sperm or seminal plasma. The research conducted using diverse livestock models can be employed to enhance the basic and applied reproduction of other mammals through the study of sperm cryotolerance biomarkers, as well as the substantial similarities between livestock and other organisms, including endangered species.",11111053
"Mitochondria are hubs of metabolic activity with a major role in ATP conversion by oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). The mammalian mitochondrial genome encodes 11 mRNAs encoding 13 OXPHOS proteins along with 2 rRNAs and 22 tRNAs, that facilitate their translation on mitoribosomes. Maintaining the internal production of core OXPHOS subunits requires modulation of the mitochondrial capacity to match the cellular requirements and correct insertion of particularly hydrophobic proteins into the inner mitochondrial membrane. The mitochondrial translation system is essential for energy production and defects result in severe, phenotypically diverse diseases, including mitochondrial diseases that typically affect postmitotic tissues with high metabolic demands. Understanding the complex mechanisms that underlie the pathologies of diseases involving impaired mitochondrial translation is key to tailoring specific treatments and effectively targeting the affected organs. Disease mutations have provided a fundamental, yet limited, understanding of mitochondrial protein synthesis, since effective modification of the mitochondrial genome has proven challenging. However, advances in next generation sequencing, cryoelectron microscopy, and multi-omic technologies have revealed unexpected and unusual features of the mitochondrial protein synthesis machinery in the last decade. Genome editing tools have generated unique models that have accelerated our mechanistic understanding of mitochondrial translation and its physiological importance. Here we review the most recent mouse models of disease pathogenesis caused by defects in mitochondrial protein synthesis and discuss their value for preclinical research and therapeutic development.",11112386
"Genetic diversity underpins evolutionary potential that is essential for the long‐term viability of wildlife populations. Captive populations harbor genetic diversity potentially lost in the wild, which could be valuable for release programs and genetic rescue. The Critically Endangered Arabian leopard (Panthera pardus nimr) has disappeared from most of its former range across the Arabian Peninsula, with fewer than 120 individuals left in the wild, and an additional 64 leopards in captivity. We (i) examine genetic diversity in the wild and captive populations to identify global patterns of genetic diversity and structure; (ii) estimate the size of the remaining leopard population across the Dhofar mountains of Oman using spatially explicit capture–recapture models on DNA and camera trap data, and (iii) explore the impact of genetic rescue using three complementary computer modeling approaches. We estimated a population size of 51 (95% CI 32–79) in the Dhofar mountains and found that 8 out of 25 microsatellite alleles present in eight loci in captive leopards were undetected in the wild. This includes two alleles present only in captive founders known to have been wild‐sourced from Yemen, which suggests that this captive population represents an important source for genetic rescue. We then assessed the benefits of reintroducing novel genetic diversity into the wild population as well as the risks of elevating the genetic load through the release of captive‐bred individuals. Simulations indicate that genetic rescue can improve the long‐term viability of the wild population by reducing its genetic load and realized load. The model also suggests that the genetic load has been partly purged in the captive population, potentially making it a valuable source population for genetic rescue. However, the greater loss of its genetic diversity could exacerbate genomic erosion of the wild population during a rescue program, and these risks and benefits should be carefully evaluated. An important next step in the recovery of the Arabian leopard is to empirically validate these conclusions, implement and monitor a genomics‐informed management plan, and optimize a strategy for genetic rescue as a tool to recover Arabia's last big cat.",11113348
"Heart failure is a leading cause of death in the elderly. Traditional Chinese medicine, a verified alternative therapeutic regimen, has been used to treat heart failure, which is less expensive and has fewer adverse effects. In this study, a total of 15 active ingredients of Astragalus membranaceus (Huangqi, HQ) were obtained; among them, Isorhamnetin, Quercetin, Calycosin, Formononetin, and Kaempferol were found to be linked to heart failure. Ang II significantly enlarged the cell size of cardiomyocytes, which could be partially reduced by Quercetin, Isorhamnetin, Calycosin, Kaempferol, or Formononetin. Ang II significantly up‐regulated ANP, BNP, β‐MHC, and CTGF expressions, whereas Quercetin, Isorhamnetin, Calycosin, Kaempferol or Formononetin treatment partially downregulated ANP, BNP, β‐MHC and CTGF expressions. Five active ingredients of HQ attenuated inflammation in Ang II‐induced cardiomyocytes by inhibiting the levels of TNF‐α, IL‐1β, IL‐18 and IL‐6. Molecular docking shows Isorhamnetin, Quercetin, Calycosin, Formononetin and Kaempferol can bind with its target protein ESR1 in a good bond by intermolecular force. Quercetin, Calycosin, Kaempferol or Formononetin treatment promoted the expression levels of ESR1 and phosphorylated ESR1 in Ang II‐stimulated cardiomyocytes; however, Isorhamnetin treatment had no effect on ESR1 and phosphorylated ESR1 expression levels. In conclusion, our results comprehensively illustrated the bioactives, potential targets, and molecular mechanism of HQ against heart failure. Isorhamnetin, Quercetin, Calycosin, Formononetin and Kaempferol might be the primary active ingredients of HQ, dominating its cardioprotective effects against heart failure through regulating ESR1 expression, which provided a basis for the clinical application of HQ to regulate cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure.",11114218
"Exportin‐1 (XPO1), a crucial protein regulating nuclear‐cytoplasmic transport, is frequently overexpressed in various cancers, driving tumor progression and drug resistance. This makes XPO1 an attractive therapeutic target. Over the past few decades, the number of available nuclear export‐selective inhibitors has been increasing. Only KPT‐330 (selinexor) has been successfully used for treating haematological malignancies, and KPT‐8602 (eltanexor) has been used for treating haematologic tumours in clinical trials. However, the use of nuclear export‐selective inhibitors for the inhibition of XPO1 expression has yet to be thoroughly investigated in clinical studies and therapeutic outcomes for solid tumours. We collected numerous literatures to explain the efficacy of XPO1 Inhibitors in preclinical and clinical studies of a wide range of solid tumours. In this review, we focus on the nuclear export function of XPO1 and results from clinical trials of its inhibitors in solid malignant tumours. We summarized the mechanism of action and therapeutic potential of XPO1 inhibitors, as well as adverse effects and response biomarkers. XPO1 inhibition has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy in the fight against cancer, offering a novel approach to targeting tumorigenic processes and overcoming drug resistance. SINE compounds have demonstrated efficacy in a wide range of solid tumours, and ongoing research is focused on optimizing their use, identifying response biomarkers, and developing effective combination therapies. Exportin‐1 (XPO1) plays a critical role in mediating nucleocytoplasmic transport and cell cycle.XPO1 dysfunction promotes tumourigenesis and drug resistance within solid tumours.The therapeutic potential and ongoing researches on XPO1 inhibitors in the treatment of solid tumours.Additional researches are essential to address safety concerns and identify biomarkers for predicting patient response to XPO1 inhibitors.

"Platelet‐to‐albumin ratio (PAR) is a new systemic inflammatory prognostic indicator associated with many inflammatory diseases. However, its role in radiation cystitis (RC) is obscure. This study aimed to explore whether PAR could be used as an effective parameter for predicting the RC risk in local advanced cervical cancer (CC) treated with radiotherapy. A total of 319 local advanced CC patients who received radical radiotherapy at Fujian Cancer Hospital were enrolled between December 2018 and January 2021. Demographics and clinical parameters were retrospectively analyzed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify the risk factors for RC. Backward and stepwise regression was applied to construct two monograms‐one with primary significant factors and the other with extra inflammatory biomarkers. A DeLong test was applied to compare the prediction abilities of two nomograms. Calibration curves and decision curve analysis (DCA) evaluated its prediction consistency, discrimination ability, and clinical net benefit. Univariate analysis showed that age, tumor size, stage, total radiation dose, pelvic radiation dose, Systemic Immune‐Inflammation Index (SII), platelet‐to‐lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and PAR were significantly associated with RC occurrence (all p < 0.05). Multivariate analyses indicated that age, tumor size, stage, total radiation dose, and PAR were independent factors (all p < 0.05). Then, the area under curve (AUC) value of the nomogramSII+PAR was higher (AUC = 0.774) compared to that of the baseline nomogram (AUC = 0.726) (p Delong = 0.02). Also, the five‐cross validation confirmed the stability of the nomogramSII+PAR. Moreover, the calibration curve and DCA exhibited the nomograms' good prediction consistency and clinical practicability. PAR and SII could be valued for CC patients who are treated with radiation therapy. The nomogram based on PAR and SII could stratify patients who need extra intervention and nursing care to prevent bladder radiation damage and improve patients' quality of life.",11117193
"We present the case of a 20-year-old woman with classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, with uncontrolled hyperandrogenemia despite supraphysiological glucocorticoid therapy. We used abiraterone acetate, an inhibitor of the 17-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase enzyme, to suppress adrenal androgen synthesis and allow physiological glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid therapy, as a proof-of-concept, before proceeding to bilateral adrenalectomy. We report the patient's clinical course, the changes in adrenal steroids, and the immunohistochemistry of the adrenals.",11119162
"MicroRNAs can interfere with protein function by suppressing their messenger RNA translation or the synthesis of its related factors. The function of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is essential to the proper formation and function of the nervous system and is seen to be regulated by many microRNAs. However, understanding how microRNAs influence BDNF actions within cells requires a wider comprehension of their integrative regulatory mechanisms. Aim: In this literature review, we have synthesized the evidence of microRNA regulation on BDNF in cells and tissues, and provided an analytical discussion about direct and indirect mechanisms that appeared to be involved in BDNF regulation by microRNAs. Methods: Searches were conducted on PubMed.gov using the terms “BDNF” AND “MicroRNA” and “brain-derived neurotrophic factor” AND “MicroRNA”, updated on 1 September 2023. Papers without open access were requested from the authors. One hundred and seventy-one papers were included for review and discussion. Results and Discussion: The local regulation of BDNF by microRNAs involves a complex interaction between a series of microRNAs with target proteins that can either inhibit or enhance BDNF expression, at the core of cell metabolism. Therefore, understanding this homeostatic balance provides resources for the future development of vector-delivery-based therapies for the neuroprotective effects of BDNF.",11119608
"Keratin-positive giant cell-rich tumor (KPGCT) is a recently described mesenchymal tumor characterized by keratin-positive cells and recurrent HMGA2–NCOR2 fusions. Due to the rarity of the disease, KPGCT is poorly understood. Our objective with this review article is to provide a comprehensive reference, offer valuable insights into the clinicopathological characteristics and pathogenesis, and summarize current therapeutic options for KPGCT. Keratin-positive giant cell-rich tumor (KPGCT) is an extremely rare and recently described mesenchymal neoplasm that occurs in both soft tissue and bone, frequently found in young women. It has locally recurrent potential if incompletely excised but low risk for metastasis. KPGCT is histologically similar to conventional giant cell tumors of soft tissue but shows the presence of keratin-positive mononuclear cells. Interestingly, KPGCT also shares some morphological features with xanthogranulomatous epithelial tumors. These two tumors have recently been shown to harbor an HMGA2–NCOR2 fusion, arguing in favor of a single entity. Surgery is the treatment of choice for localized KPGCT. Therapeutic options for advanced or metastatic disease are unknown. This review provides an overview of the current knowledge on the clinical presentation, pathogenesis, histopathology, and treatment of KPGCT. In addition, we will discuss the differential diagnosis of this emerging entity.",11120402
"Endometriosis is a benign, estrogen-dependent condition, usually occurring in menstruating and, rarely, in postmenopausal women, in which endometrial glands and stroma grow ectopically outside the uterus. Most often, ectopic endometrial tissue is found within the pelvis and nearby structures. However, endometrial tissue within the upper gastrointestinal tract is very rare and can be a source of bleeding and abdominal pain. Here, we report a case of a 71-year-old postmenopausal woman with hematochezia and diffuse abdominal pain, who was found to have pyloric endometriosis, the pathogenesis of which we will briefly explore.",11124663
"Selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) are an appealing carrier for the targeted delivery. The selenium nanoparticles are gaining global attention because of the potential therapeutic applications in several diseases e.g., rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), asthma, liver, and various autoimmune disorders like psoriasis, cancer, diabetes, and a variety of infectious diseases. Despite the fact still there is no recent literature that summarises the therapeutic applications of SeNPs. There are some challenges that need to be addressed like finding targets for SeNPs in various diseases, and the various functionalization techniques utilized to increase SeNP’s stability while facilitating wide drug-loaded SeNP distribution to tumor areas and preventing off-target impacts need to focus on understanding more about the therapeutic aspects for better understanding the science behind it. Keeping that in mind we have focused on this gap and try to summarize all recent key targeted therapies for SeNPs in cancer treatment and the numerous functionalization strategies. We have also focused on recent advancements in SeNP functionalization methodologies and mechanisms for biomedical applications, particularly in anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and anti-infection therapeutics. Based on our observation we found that SeNPs could potentially be useful in suppressing viral epidemics, like the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, in complement to their antibacterial and antiparasitic uses. SeNPs are significant nanoplatforms with numerous desirable properties for clinical translation.",11127871
"What is the effect of the chemical in vitro activation (cIVA) protocol compared with fragmentation only (Frag, also known as mechanical IVA) on gene expression, follicle activation and growth in human ovarian tissue in vitro? Although histological assessment shows that cIVA significantly increases follicle survival and growth compared to Frag, both protocols stimulate extensive and nearly identical transcriptomic changes in cultured tissue compared to freshly collected ovarian tissue, including marked changes in energy metabolism and inflammatory responses. Treatments based on cIVA of the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway in ovarian tissue followed by auto-transplantation have been administered to patients with refractory premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) and resulted in live births. However, comparable effects with mere tissue fragmentation have been shown, questioning the added value of chemical stimulation that could potentially activate oncogenic responses. Fifty-nine ovarian cortical biopsies were obtained from consenting women undergoing elective caesarean section (C-section). The samples were fragmented for culture studies. Half of the fragments were exposed to bpV (HOpic)+740Y-P (Frag+cIVA group) during the first 24 h of culture, while the other half were cultured with medium only (Frag group). Subsequently, both groups were cultured with medium only for an additional 6 days. Tissue and media samples were collected for histological, transcriptomic, steroid hormone, and cytokine/chemokine analyses at various time points. Effects on follicles were evaluated by counting and scoring serial sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin before and after the 7-day culture. Follicle function was assessed by quantification of steroids by ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry at different time points. Cytokines and chemokines were measured by multiplex assay. Transcriptomic effects were measured by RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) of the tissue after the initial 24-h culture. Selected differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were validated by quantitative PCR and immunofluorescence in cultured ovarian tissue as well as in KGN cell (human ovarian granulosa-like tumor cell line) culture experiments. Compared to the Frag group, the Frag+cIVA group exhibited a significantly higher follicle survival rate, increased numbers of secondary follicles, and larger follicle sizes. Additionally, the tissue in the Frag+cIVA group produced less dehydroepiandrosterone compared to Frag. Cytokine measurement showed a strong inflammatory response at the start of the culture in both groups. The RNA-seq data revealed modest differences between the Frag+cIVA and Frag groups, with only 164 DEGs identified using a relaxed cut-off of false discovery rate (FDR) <0.1. Apart from the expected PI3K–protein kinase B (Akt) pathway, cIVA also regulated pathways related to hypoxia, cytokines, and inflammation. In comparison to freshly collected ovarian tissue, gene expression in general was markedly affected in both the Frag+cIVA and Frag groups, with a total of 3119 and 2900 DEGs identified (FDR < 0.001), respectively. The top enriched gene sets in both groups included several pathways known to modulate follicle growth such as mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)C1 signaling. Significant changes compared to fresh tissue were also observed in the expression of genes encoding for steroidogenesis enzymes and classical granulosa cell markers in both groups. Intriguingly, we discovered a profound upregulation of genes related to glycolysis and its upstream regulator in both Frag and Frag+cIVA groups, and these changes were further boosted by the cIVA treatment. Cell culture experiments confirmed glycolysis-related genes as direct targets of the cIVA drugs. In conclusion, cIVA enhances follicle growth, as expected, but the mechanisms may be more complex than PI3K–Akt–mTOR alone, and the impact on function and quality of the follicles after the culture period remains an open question. Data were deposited in the GEO data base, accession number GSE234765. The code for sequencing analysis can be found in https://github.com/tialiv/IVA_project. Similar to the published IVA protocols, the first steps in our study were performed in an in vitro culture model where the ovarian tissue was isolated from the regulation of hypothalamic–pituitary–ovarian axis. Further in vivo experiments will be needed, for example in xeno-transplantation models, to explore the long-term impacts of the discovered effects. The tissue collected from patients undergoing C-section may not be comparable to tissue of patients with POI. The general impact of fragmentation and short (24 h) in vitro culture on gene expression in ovarian tissue far exceeded the effects of cIVA. Yet, follicle growth was stimulated by cIVA, which may suggest effects on specific cell populations that may be diluted in bulk RNA-seq. Nevertheless, we confirmed the impact of cIVA on glycolysis using a cell culture model, suggesting impacts on cellular signaling beyond the PI3K pathway. The profound changes in inflammation and glycolysis following fragmentation and culture could contribute to follicle activation and loss in ovarian tissue culture, as well as in clinical applications, such as fertility preservation by ovarian tissue auto-transplantation.

"Alström syndrome is a form of inherited obesity caused by a single gene abnormality and is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. It is characterised by a variety of clinical manifestations, including progressive visual and hearing impairment, type 2 diabetes mellitus, dilated cardiomyopathy, and hepatic and renal dysfunction, in addition to obesity. Recent insights underline the pivotal involvement of the disease-associated gene (ALMS1) in cilia formation and function, leading to the classification of its clinical manifestations as a ciliopathy. This review delineates the diverse clinical indicators defining the syndrome and elucidates its pathological underpinnings.",11128078
"In recent decades, antibodies have emerged as indispensable therapeutics for combating diseases, particularly viral infections. However, their development has been hindered by limited structural information and labor-intensive engineering processes. Fortunately, significant advancements in deep learning methods have facilitated the precise prediction of protein structure and function by leveraging co-evolution information from homologous proteins. Despite these advances, predicting the conformation of antibodies remains challenging due to their unique evolution and the high flexibility of their antigen-binding regions. Here, to address this challenge, we present the Bio-inspired Antibody Language Model (BALM). This model is trained on a vast dataset comprising 336 million 40% nonredundant unlabeled antibody sequences, capturing both unique and conserved properties specific to antibodies. Notably, BALM showcases exceptional performance across four antigen-binding prediction tasks. Moreover, we introduce BALMFold, an end-to-end method derived from BALM, capable of swiftly predicting full atomic antibody structures from individual sequences. Remarkably, BALMFold outperforms those well-established methods like AlphaFold2, IgFold, ESMFold and OmegaFold in the antibody benchmark, demonstrating significant potential to advance innovative engineering and streamline therapeutic antibody development by reducing the need for unnecessary trials. The BALMFold structure prediction server is freely available at https://beamlab-sh.com/models/BALMFold.",11128484
"BRAFV600E is the most common genetic mutation in differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) occurring in 60% of patients and drives malignant tumour cell phenotypes including proliferation, metastasis and immune‐escape. BRAFV600E‐mutated papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) also displays greatly reduced expression of thyroid differentiation markers, thus tendency to radioactive iodine (RAI) refractory and poor prognosis. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms and main oncogenic events underlying BRAFV600E will guide future therapy development. Bioinformatics and clinical specimen analyses, genetic manipulation of BRAFV600E‐induced PTC model, functional and mechanism exploration guided with transcriptomic screening, as well as systematic rescue experiments were applied to investigate miR‐31 function within BRAFV600E‐induced thyroid cancer development. Besides, nanoparticles carrying miR‐31 antagomirs were testified to alleviate 131I iodide therapy on PTC models. We identify miR‐31 as a significantly increased onco‐miR in BRAFV600E‐associated PTC that promotes tumour progression, metastasis and RAI refractoriness via sustained Wnt/β‐catenin signalling. Mechanistically, highly activated BRAF/MAPK pathway induces miR‐31 expression via c‐Jun‐mediated transcriptional regulation across in vitro and transgenic mouse models. MiR‐31 in turn facilitates β‐catenin stabilisation via directly repressing tumour suppressors CEBPA and DACH1, which direct the expression of multiple essential Wnt/β‐catenin pathway inhibitors. Genetic functional assays showed that thyroid‐specific knockout of miR‐31 inhibited BRAFV600E‐induced PTC progression, and strikingly, enhanced expression of sodium‐iodide symporter and other thyroid differentiation markers, thus promoted 131I uptake. Nanoparticle‐mediated application of anti‐miR‐31 antagomirs markedly elevated radio‐sensitivity of BRAFV600E‐induced PTC tumours to 131I therapy, and efficiently suppressed tumour progression in the pre‐clinical mouse model. Our findings elucidate a novel BRAF/MAPK‐miR‐31‐Wnt/β‐catenin regulatory mechanism underlying clinically BRAFV600E‐associated DTC tumourigenesis and dedifferentiation, also highlight a potential adjuvant therapeutic strategy for advanced DTC.",11128713
"A mutation in the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (STAR) gene, which encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in steroid hormone synthesis, causes a severe form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) known as lipoid CAH (LCAH). LCAH presents with primary adrenal insufficiency (PAI) as well as atypical genitalia. Individuals with LCAH require adrenal steroid hormone supplements for survival. Masculinization in males with STAR deficiency varies from incomplete to normal virilization. Radiological examinations reveal enlarged and lipid-laden adrenals. A 10-year-old boy born of second-degree consanguinity presented with weight gain and hyperpigmentation for 1 year. He was diagnosed with PAI at age 7 months and treated with hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone. Dynamic adrenal gland testing revealed undetectable hormone reserves. Imaging detected hypoplastic adrenals and a small testis with testicular adrenal rests (TART). Genetic analysis indicated a novel homozygous pathogenic variant of STAR in exon 7, c.814C > G(pArg272Gly) associated with LCAH (OMIM No. 201710). Testing revealed that asymptomatic family members and relatives were heterozygotes for the variant. The patient was diagnosed with nonclassic LCAH with hypoplastic adrenals and TART. Adequate hormone supplementation resulted in TART regression. This genetic variation is reported for the first time.",11128940
"Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome, an extremely rare genetic disorder, is characterized by the development of fibrofolliculomas, lung cysts and subsequent recurrent pneumothorax, and kidney neoplasia. This report highlights the case of a 56-year-old female with a history of right vestibular schwannoma status post stereotactic radiotherapy and vulva bartholin’s gland carcinoma who was initially evaluated by primary care for a 6-month history of intermittent, red, raised, widespread rash accompanied by fever, chills, and body aches. A punch biopsy of the rash was performed, which was notable for an urticarial tissue reaction with focal changes of leukocytoclasia and negative direct immunofluorescence. Laboratory tests, which included an autoimmune genetic and periodic fever panel, were unremarkable. Whole genome sequencing returned positive for a pathogenic variant in folliculin gene, consistent with a diagnosis of Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome.",11129575
"T cells are crucial for adaptive immunity to regulate proper immune response and immune homeostasis. T cell development occurs in the thymus and mainly differentiates into CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets. Upon stimulation, naive T cells differentiate into distinct CD4+ helper and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, which mediate immunity homeostasis and defend against pathogens or tumours. Trace elements are minimal yet essential components of human body that cannot be overlooked, and they participate in enzyme activation, DNA synthesis, antioxidant defence, hormone production, etc. Moreover, trace elements are particularly involved in immune regulations. Here, we have summarized the roles of eight essential trace elements (iron, zinc, selenium, copper, iodine, chromium, molybdenum, cobalt) in T cell development, activation and differentiation, and immune response, which provides significant insights into developing novel approaches to modulate immunoregulation and immunotherapy.",11129730
"A female in her 60s with vague abdominal symptoms was found to have a pancreatic mass in her CT scan. A core needle biopsy done endoscopically demonstrated a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. The patient completed nine cycles of neoadjuvant systemic mFOLFIRINOX. Repeat staging demonstrated a partial radiographic response. She underwent an open pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy with segmental superior mesenteric vein resection with primary reconstruction (ISGPS Type 3). The final pathology demonstrated a poorly differentiated adenosquamous carcinoma, R1 margin status. The case report demonstrates the effect of mFOLFIRINOX on pancreatic adenosquamous (PASC) carcinoma with a review of the microscopic pictures following the neoadjuvant therapy. It can be postulated that glandular component being the major component in a PASC has a good response to mFOLFIRINOX like that seen in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma with some presumed effect on the squamous component as well. From the above case report, we are proposing that mFOLFIRINOX can be an effective chemotherapy regime in the management of PASC.",11129824
"Currently, tumor treatment modalities such as immunotherapy and targeted therapy have more stringent requirements for obtaining tumor growth information and require more accurate and easy‐to‐operate tumor information detection methods. Compared with traditional tissue biopsy, liquid biopsy is a novel, minimally invasive, real‐time detection tool for detecting information directly or indirectly released by tumors in human body fluids, which is more suitable for the requirements of new tumor treatment modalities. Liquid biopsy has not been widely used in clinical practice, and there are fewer reviews of related clinical applications. This review summarizes the clinical applications of liquid biopsy components (e.g., circulating tumor cells, circulating tumor DNA, extracellular vesicles, etc.) in tumorigenesis and progression. This includes the development process and detection techniques of liquid biopsies, early screening of tumors, tumor growth detection, and guiding therapeutic strategies (liquid biopsy‐based personalized medicine and prediction of treatment response). Finally, the current challenges and future directions for clinical applications of liquid biopsy are proposed. In sum, this review will inspire more researchers to use liquid biopsy technology to promote the realization of individualized therapy, improve the efficacy of tumor therapy, and provide better therapeutic options for tumor patients.",11130638
"The cestode Taenia hydatigena uses canids, primarily dogs, as definitive hosts, whereas the metacestode larval stage cysticercus infects a range of intermediate hosts, including domestic animals such as goats, sheep and pigs. In this study, we aimed to determine the genetic differences and haplotypes of Cysticercus tenuicollis isolates obtained from sheep and goats slaughtered in the Bingol and Elazig provinces of Turkey. C. tenuicollis isolates were collected from 44 sheep and 26 goats slaughtered in slaughterhouses in Bingol and Elazig. After the isolation of total genomic DNA from C. tenuicollis isolates, the genetic characterization of the partial mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase 1 (CO1) gene region (866 bp) was amplified using specific primers by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the products were then sequenced, and haplotype and genetic diversity analyses were carried out. As a result of the haplotype network analyses, 34 different haplotypes were detected around the main haplotype (Hap02) arranged in a star‐like configuration and separated from other haplotypes by 1–28 mutation steps and covering 22.85% (16/70) of all isolates. Twenty‐seven polymorphic fields were detected, 77.77% (21/27) of which were parsimony‐informative, and secondary haplotype and nucleotide diversity were observed. Additionally, we detected high intraspecies haplotype diversity (hd: 0.933) and high nucleotide diversity (π: 0.00383), with 27 different nucleotide variation positions among the haplotypes of the isolates. Tajima's D value was negative, indicating population expansion and/or selection purification. The significantly negative Fu's Fs values indicated recent population expansion or the presence of expected rare haplotypes. The results of this study confirmed that C. tenuicollis isolates clustered in one lineage and were closely related to the relevant reference sequences in different countries, confirming the circulation of C. tenuicollis in different geographical regions.",11131354
"Copper, a trace element and vital cofactor, plays a crucial role in the maintenance of biological functions. Recent evidence has established significant correlations between copper levels, cancer development and metastasis. The strong redox‐active properties of copper offer both benefits and disadvantages to cancer cells. The intestinal tract, which is primarily responsible for copper uptake and regulation, may suffer from an imbalance in copper homeostasis. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the most prevalent primary cancer of the intestinal tract and is an aggressive malignant disease with limited therapeutic options. Current research is primarily focused on the relationship between copper and CRC. Innovative concepts, such as cuproplasia and cuproptosis, are being explored to understand copper‐related cellular proliferation and death. Cuproplasia is the regulation of cell proliferation that is mediated by both enzymatic and nonenzymatic copper‐modulated activities. Whereas, cuproptosis refers to cell death induced by excess copper via promoting the abnormal oligomerisation of lipoylated proteins within the tricarboxylic acid cycle, as well as by diminishing the levels of iron‐sulphur cluster proteins. A comprehensive understanding of copper‐related cellular proliferation and death mechanisms offers new avenues for CRC treatment. In this review, we summarise the evolving molecular mechanisms, ranging from abnormal intracellular copper concentrations to the copper‐related proteins that are being discovered, and discuss the role of copper in the pathogenesis, progression and potential therapies for CRC. Understanding the relationship between copper and CRC will help provide a comprehensive theoretical foundation for innovative treatment strategies in CRC management.",11131360
"Esophageal cancer (ESCA) is a highly invasive malignant tumor with poor prognosis. This study aimed to discover a generalized and high‐sensitivity immune prognostic signature that could stratify ESCA patients and predict their overall survival, and to discover potential therapeutic drugs by the connectivity map. The key gene modules significantly related to clinical traits (survival time and state) of ESCA patients were selected by weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WCGNA), then the univariate and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression analyses were used to construct a 15‐immune‐related gene prognostic signature. The immune‐related risk model was related to clinical and pathologic factors and remained an effective independent prognostic factor. Enrichment analyses revealed that the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of the high‐ and low‐risk groups were associated with tumor cell proliferation and immune mechanisms. Based on the gathered data, a small molecule drug named perphenazine (PPZ) was elected. The pharmacological analysis indicates that PPZ could help in adjuvant therapy of ESCA through regulation of metabolic process and cellular proliferation, enhancement of immunologic functions, and inhibition of inflammatory reactions. Furthermore, molecular docking was performed to explore and verify the PPZ‐core target interactions. We succeed in structuring the immune‐related prognostic model, which could be used to distinguish and predict patients' survival outcome, and screening a small molecule drug named PPZ. Prospective studies also are needed to further validate its analytical accuracy for estimating prognoses and confirm the potential use of PPZ for treating ESCA.",11131936
"We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to better understand the association between rs1799762 PAI-1 gene polymorphism and the risk of RPL. A systematic search for studies that assessed the association between PAI-1 4G/5G polymorphism and RPL risk published in search sources, PubMed/Medline, ISI Web of Knowledge, Scopus, and Google Scholar till January 2024 was conducted. There were 23 case-control studies in total, with a high degree of statistical heterogeneity among them which indicated the need for subgroup analysis. We found a significant positive association between the risk of RPL and 4G/4G PAI-1 (OR: 2.57; 95% CI: 1.69-3.90), likewise 4G/5G (OR: 2/02 95% CI: 1.39-2.92) and mixed genotype (4G/4G+4G/5G) (OR: 2.31 95% CI: 1.81-2.93). Considering the ethnicity, the 4G/4G polymorphism is significantly associated with Asian descent (OR: 2.10; CI: 1.65-2.69) while the strong association (OR: 6.47; CI: 3.23-12.97) observed in the Greater Middle East descent is not statistically significant (P=0.16). PAI-1 4G/5G polymorphism association with RPL was only significant in Greater Middle East descent (OR: 2.93; CI: 2.41-3.56), and mixed genotype was significantly associated with RPL in Asian (OR: 2.37; CI: 1.55-3.61), Greater Middle East (OR: 3.01; CI: 2.16-4.19), and European populations (OR: 1.38; CI: 0.91-2.10). The association between RPL and PAI-1 4G/4G was significant for RPLs both under 12 weeks (OR: 1.82; 95% CI: 1.34-2.47), and under 24 weeks (OR: 1.46; 95% CI: 1.11-1.92), while considering heterozygote form the association was only significant for RPLs under 24 weeks (OR: 1.91; 95% CI: 1.58-2.31). Regarding the mixed genotype, there is a significant positive association between PAI-1 and RPL for RPLs under 12 weeks (OR: 2.09; 95% CI: 1.49-2.93), and under 24 weeks (OR: 2.10; 95% CI: 1.52-2.92). Our findings indicate a significant association between the rs1799762 PAI-1 polymorphism and the risk of RPL.",11134946
"A 37-year-old male with type two diabetes presented to the hospital with new-onset heart failure and renal dysfunction. His left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction was less than 10%. Transthoracic echocardiography and cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging also revealed severe bicuspid aortic valve stenosis, dilated cardiomyopathy with LV hypertrophy, prominent LV trabeculations, and features suggestive of mild myocarditis with active inflammation. While myocarditis was suspected on CMR imaging, his mild degree of myocardial involvement did not explain the entirety of his clinical presentation, degree of LV dysfunction, or other structural abnormalities. An extensive work-up for his LV dysfunction was unremarkable for ischemic, metabolic, infiltrative, infectious, toxic, oncologic, connective tissue, and autoimmune etiologies. Genetic testing was positive for a myosin heavy chain 7 (MYH7) variant, which was deemed likely to be a unifying etiology underlying his presentation. The MYH7 sarcomere gene allows beta-myosin expression in heart ventricles, with variants associated with hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathies, congenital heart diseases, myocarditis, and excessive trabeculation (formerly known as left ventricular noncompaction). This case highlights the diverse array of cardiac pathologies that can present with MYH7 gene variants and reviews an extensive work-up for this unusual presentation of heart failure in a young patient.",11135834
"To report the case of a girl presenting a severe phenotype of mandibuloacral dysplasia type A (MADA) characterized by prominent osteolytic changes and ectodermal defects, associated with a rare homozygous LMNA missense mutation (c.1579C>T). A 6-year-old girl was evaluated during hospitalization exhibiting the following dysmorphic signs: subtotal alopecia, dysmorphic facies with prominent eyes, marked micrognathia and retrognathia, small beaked nose, teeth crowding and thin lips, generalized lipodystrophy, narrow and sloping shoulders, generalized joint stiffness and bone reabsorption in the terminal phalanges. In dermatological examination, atrophic skin, loss of cutaneous elasticity, hyperkeratosis, dermal calcinosis, and hyperpigmented and hypochromic patches were observed. Radiology exams performed showed bilateral absence of the mandibular condyles, clavicle resorption with local amorphous bone mass confluence with the scapulae, shoulder joints with subluxation and severe bone dysplasia, hip dysplasia, osteopenia and subcutaneous calcifications. MADA is a rare autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in LMNA gene. It is characterized by craniofacial deformities, skeletal anomalies, skin alterations, lipodystrophy in certain regions of the body and premature ageing. Typical MADA is caused by the p.R527H mutation in the LMNA gene. However, molecular analysis performed from oral epithelial cells obtained from the patient showed the rare mutation c.1579C>T, p. R527C in the exon 9 of LMNA. This is the sixth family identified with this mutation described in the literature.",11135898
"Current methods of processing archaeological samples combined with advances in sequencing methods lead to disclosure of a large part of H. neanderthalensis and Denisovans genetic information. It is hardly surprising that the genome variability between modern humans, Denisovans and H. neanderthalensis is relatively limited. Genomic studies may provide insight on the metabolism of extinct human species or lineages. Detailed analysis of G-quadruplex sequences in H. neanderthalensis and Denisovans mitochondrial DNA showed us interesting features. Relatively similar patterns in mitochondrial DNA are found compared to modern humans, with one notable exception for H. neanderthalensis. An interesting difference between H. neanderthalensis and H. sapiens corresponds to a motif found in the D-loop region of mtDNA, which is responsible for mitochondrial DNA replication. This area is directly responsible for the number of mitochondria and consequently for the efficient energy metabolism of cell. H. neanderthalensis harbor a long uninterrupted run of guanines in this region, which may cause problems for replication, in contrast with H. sapiens, for which this run is generally shorter and interrupted. One may propose that the predominant H. sapiens motif provided a selective advantage for modern humans regarding mtDNA replication and function.",11137754
"The causes of infertility have remained an important challenge. The relationship between VDR gene polymorphisms and infertility has been reported, with controversial findings. We aimed to determine this relationship by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis. The study was started with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) declaration and the final draft was registered as a protocol in PROSPERO (ID: CRD42023416535). The international electronic databases including PubMed (Medline), Scopus, Web of Sciences, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINHAL) were searched until January 30, 2023, by using appropriate keywords. The quality of the final studies was assessed using the NOS Checklist for case–control studies. The odds ratios (ORs) for each of the genetic models were pooled, and a subgroup analysis based on geographical region and types of infertility was carried out by the MetaGenyo online tool. Case–control studies including 18 and 2 studies about infertility in women and men, respectively, and 4 miscarriage studies were entered into the meta-analysis. The VDR gene TaqI polymorphism was associated with infertility susceptibility in women in the allele contrast [OR = 1.2065, 95% CI (1.0846–1.3421); P = 0.0005], Recessive model [OR = 1.3836, 95% CI (1.1197–1.7096); P = 0.002], Dominant model [OR = 1.2146, 95% CI (0.0484–1.4072); P = 0.009], Homozygote [OR = 1.4596, 95% CI (1.1627–1.8325); P = 0.001], and TT vs. Tt [OR = 1.2853, 95% CI (1.0249–1.6117); P = 0.029. ApaI and FokI gene polymorphisms were found to be significantly protective SNPs against women and men infertility in the Dominant model [OR = 0.8379, 95% CI (0.7039- 0.9975); P = 0.046] and Recessive model [OR = 0.421, 95% CI (0.1821–0.9767); P = 0.043], respectively. Sub-group meta-analysis showed a protection association of ApaI in dominant [OR = 0.7738, 95% CI = 0.6249–0.9580; P = 0.018] and AA vs. aa [OR = 0.7404, 95 CI% (0.5860–0.9353) P = 0.011725] models in PCOS subgroup, however, a negative association with idiopathic infertility was found in AA vs. Aa [OR = 1.7063, 95% CI (1.1039–2.6375); P = 0.016187] and Aa vs. aa [OR = 0.6069, 95% CI (0.3761–0.9792); P = 0.040754]. TaqI SNP was significantly associated with infertility in the African population and BsmI was associated with the disease mostly in the Asian population. This meta-analysis showed that the TaqI polymorphism may be linked to women’s infertility susceptibility. However, ApaI and FokI might be the protective SNPs against infertility in Women and men, respectively.",11138068
"Weight loss and lifestyle interventions are the mainstay of treatment in pediatric NAFLD. There are gaps in the literature on the objective improvement in BMI to meaningfully impact NAFLD in children.   To determine the decrease in BMI associated with a significant decline in ALT and other metabolic parameters.   Retrospective chart review of pediatric patients with the diagnosis of NAFLD. Data were collected at the baseline and 6 and 12 months. A linear regression model was used to assess the percent change in BMI predictive of change in ALT and other metabolic parameters.   281 charts were included. 71% of patients who had up to a 2.5% loss in BMI at 6 months had a decrease in ALT of up to 10 U/L compared to 43% patients who did not have a decrease in BMI up to 2.5% loss at the same time period (P=0.01). The linear regression model showed that 6-month and 12-month percent changes in BMI are predictive of 6-month and 12-month ALT changes (P=0.01 and 0.02), respectively. ALT normalization was achieved on 12% of patients with a ≥2.5% decrease in BMI at 6 months compared to 1% of patients that had no decrease of ≥2.5% decrease in BMI at 6 months (P=0.01). The mean BMI Z-score decline was 0.18 (P=0.001) in the group with a ≥2.5% decrease in BMI at 6 months.   BMI loss of up to 2.5% and the mean BMI Z-score 0.18 are associated with a significant decrease in ALT of up to 10 U/L. BMI percent change at 6 months and 12 months is predictive of changes in ALT. These results should help guide providers in clinical practice set objective goals for the management of children with NAFLD resulting from obesity.",11139528
"Ayurveda Rasayana Therapy (ART) may serve as a safe and effective alternative treatment option for chemo‐intolerance high‐grade stage IV follicular lymphoma patients for increasing survival and tumor regression. Follicular lymphoma (FL), also called follicle center lymphoma/nodular lymphoma, observed in the B lymphocytes (B‐cells). Available therapeutic options for follicular lymphoma are associated with various side effects and, patients with co‐morbidities can seldom tolerate the chemotherapy regimens. Rasayana therapy not only resulted in tumor regression and improved survival but also dealt with the adverse effects of previous chemotherapy drugs. Herein, we present a case of a 74‐year‐old female diagnosed with Follicular lymphoma who had undergone three cycles of chemotherapy with unresolved disease outcome and serious adverse events. The patient refused to undergo further cycles of chemotherapy. Her family decided to start Ayurveda treatment for her as an alternative therapy for cancer care. On thorough case taking considering the Ayurveda parameters personalized Rasayana therapy as planned for the patient with an aim for improvement in Quality of Life (QoL), increasing survival, and optimizing body's immune response to fight the tumor. After treatment of 8 months, this case demonstrated partial tumor response as evidenced by PET‐CT‐scan. Quality of Life as evaluated using FACT‐G was also seen improved besides significant improvement in physical performance status evaluated using ECOG. The patient showed a survival of 3.5 years after starting Ayurveda Rasayana Therapy (ART). Rasayana therapy was well tolerated by the patient. This case report indicates the potential role of ART as a therapeutic option in geriatric cancer patients who are not eligible for cytotoxic interventions. Case warrants further systematic investigation to evaluate the potential role of ART in the treatment of geriatric cancer patients.",11139640
"Simultaneous inhibition of angiotensin II AT1 and endothelin ETA receptors has emerged as a promising approach for treatment of chronic progressive kidney disease. This therapeutic approach has been advanced by the introduction of sparsentan, the first dual AT1 and ETA receptor antagonist. Sparsentan is a single molecule with high affinity for both receptors. It is US Food and Drug Administration approved for immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) and is currently being developed as a treatment for rare kidney diseases, such as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Clinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of sparsentan in these conditions. In parallel with clinical development, studies have been conducted to elucidate the mechanisms of action of sparsentan and its position in the context of published evidence characterizing the nephroprotective effects of dual ETA and AT1 receptor inhibition. This review summarizes this evidence, documenting beneficial anti-inflammatory, antifibrotic, and hemodynamic actions of sparsentan in the kidney and protective actions in glomerular endothelial cells, mesangial cells, the tubulointerstitium, and podocytes, thus providing the rationale for the use of sparsentan as therapy for focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and IgAN and suggesting potential benefits in other renal diseases, such as Alport syndrome.",11139641
"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading cancers worldwide, with metastasis being a major cause of high mortality rates among patients. In this study, dysregulated gene Tweety homolog 3 (TTYH3) was identified by Gene Expression Omnibus database. Public databases were used to predict potential competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) for TTYH3. Quantitative real‐time polymerase chain reaction, western blot, and immunohistochemistry were utilized to analyze TTYH3 and histone deacetylase 7 (HDAC7) levels. Luciferase assays confirmed miR‐1271‐5p directly targeting the 3′ untranslated regions of TTYH3 and HDAC7. In vitro experiments such as transwell and human umbilical vein endothelial cell tube formation, as well as in vivo mouse models, were conducted to assess the biological functions of TTYH3 and HDAC7. We discovered that upregulation of TTYH3 in CRC promotes cell migration by affecting the Epithelial–mesenchymal transition pathway, which was independent of its ion channel activity. Mechanistically, TTYH3 and HDAC7 functioned as ceRNAs, reciprocally regulating each other's expression. TTYH3 competes for binding miR‐1271‐5p, increasing HDAC7 expression, facilitating CRC metastasis and angiogenesis. This study reveals the critical role of TTYH3 in promoting CRC metastasis through ceRNA crosstalk, offering new insights into potential therapeutic targets for clinical intervention.",11141500
"Cervical cancer (CC) and other malignant malignancies are acknowledged to be primarily caused by persistent human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Historically, vaccinations against viruses that produce neutralizing antibodies unique to the virus have been an affordable way to manage viral diseases. CC risk is decreased, but not eliminated, by HPV vaccinations. Since vaccinations have been made available globally, almost 90% of HPV infections have been successfully avoided. On the lesions and diseases that are already present, however, no discernible treatment benefit has been shown. As a result, therapeutic vaccines that elicit immune responses mediated by cells are necessary for the treatment of established infections and cancers. mRNA vaccines possess remarkable potential in combating viral diseases and malignancy as a result of their superior industrial production, safety, and efficacy. Furthermore, considering the expeditiousness of production, the mRNA vaccine exhibits promise as a therapeutic approach targeting HPV. Given that the HPV-encoded early proteins, including oncoproteins E6 and E7, are consistently present in HPV-related cancers and pre-cancerous lesions and have crucial functions in the progression and persistence of HPV-related diseases, they serve as ideal targets for therapeutic HPV vaccines. The action mechanism of HPV and HPV-related cancer mRNA vaccines, their recent advancements in clinical trials, and the potential for their therapeutic applications are highlighted in this study, which also offers a quick summary of the present state of mRNA vaccines. Lastly, we highlight a few difficulties with mRNA HPV vaccination clinical practice and provide our thoughts on further advancements in this quickly changing sector. It is expected that mRNA vaccines will soon be produced quickly for clinical HPV prevention and treatment.

"Histone deacetylase (HDAC) serves as a critical molecular regulator in the pathobiology of various malignancies and have garnered attention as a viable target for therapeutic intervention. A variety of HDAC inhibitors (HDACis) have been developed to target HDACs. Many preclinical studies have conclusively demonstrated the antitumor effects of HDACis, whether used as monotherapy or in combination treatments. On this basis, researchers have conducted various clinical studies to evaluate the potential of selective and pan-HDACis in clinical settings. In our work, we extensively summarized and organized current clinical trials, providing a comprehensive overview of the current clinical advancements in targeting HDAC therapy. Furthermore, we engaged in discussions about several clinical trials that did not yield positive outcomes, analyzing the factors that led to their lack of anticipated therapeutic effectiveness. Apart from the experimental design factors, issues such as toxicological side effects, tumor heterogeneity, and unexpected off-target effects also contributed to these less-than-expected results. These challenges have naturally become significant barriers to the application of HDACis. Despite these challenges, we believe that advancements in HDACi research and improvements in combination therapies will pave the way or lead to a broad and hopeful future in the treatment of solid tumors.",11143662
"As one of the most prevalent chronic inflammatory skin diseases, atopic dermatitis (AD) increasingly affects the aging population. Amid the ongoing global aging trend, it’s essential to recognize the intricate relationship between AD and aging. This paper reviews existing knowledge, summarizing clinical observations of associations between AD and aging-related diseases in various systems, including endocrine, cardiovascular, and neurological. Additionally, it discusses major theories explaining the correlation, encompassing skin-mucosal barriers, systemic inflammation and stress, genes, signal transduction, and environmental and behavioral factors. The association between AD and aging holds significant importance, both in population and basic perspectives. While further research is warranted, this paper aims to inspire deeper exploration of inflammation/allergy-aging dynamics and the timely management of elderly patients with AD.",11144009
"Human hemoglobin of G-Makassar and hemoglobin E (Hb E) are hemoglobin variants that affect Beta (β) globin. Hb G-Makassar is a very rare variant while Hb E is estimated to affect at least one million people worldwide. Both Hb G-Makassar and Hb E can be inherited in the heterozygous, homozygous or compound heterozygous state. This case series describes the characteristics of four individuals with compound heterozygosity for Hb G-Makassar/Hb E cases in Malaysia. To the best of our knowledge, these are the only four individuals with this genotype reported in the literature. We present four cases of compound heterozygosity for Hb G-Makassar/Hb E identified from October 2014 to January 2021. All the cases were incidental findings whereby the screening Hb analysis showed the presence of peaks in both Hb S and Hb E zones on capillary electrophoresis (CE) and cation-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Molecular analysis confirmed the findings of compound heterozygous Hb G-Makassar/Hb E. Two cases had a history of anemia secondary to unrelated conditions that resolved with treatment of the underlying cause. The other two cases were asymptomatic individuals who were detected through Malaysia’s National Thalassemia Screening program. On the last follow-up, all the individuals were well, non-transfusion dependent, and had no reported history of chronic anemia, bleeding, hemolysis or thromboembolism complications. The cases reported here highlight the possibilities for rare compound heterozygous states in multi-ethnicity populations such as Malaysia. Compound heterozygous Hb G-Makassar/Hb E individuals are clinically silent with laboratory values suggesting microcytic and hypochromic red blood cells. Further local epidemiology or population studies with genotyping tests are required for a better understanding of the diversity of its clinical phenotype.",11144427
"For many diseases, and cancer in particular, early diagnosis allows a wider range of therapies and a better disease management. This has led to improvements in diagnostic procedures, most often based on tissue biopsies or blood samples. Other biological fluids have been used to diagnose disease, and among them saliva offers a number of advantages because it can be collected non-invasively from large populations at relatively low cost. To what extent might saliva content reveal the presence of a tumour located at a distance from the oral cavity and the molecular information obtained from saliva be used to establish a diagnosis are current questions. This review focuses primarily on the content of saliva and shows how it potentially offers a source of diagnosis, possibly at an early stage, for pathologies such as cancers or endometriosis.",11144459
"Solute carrier family 26 (Slc26) is a family of anion exchangers with 11 members in mammals (named Slc26a1‐a11). Here, we identified a novel member of the slc26 family, slc26a12, located in tandem with slc26a2 in the genomes of several vertebrate lineages. BLAST and synteny analyses of various jawed vertebrate genome databases revealed that slc26a12 is present in coelacanths, amphibians, reptiles, and birds but not in cartilaginous fishes, lungfish, mammals, or ray‐finned fishes. In some avian and reptilian lineages such as owls, penguins, egrets, and ducks, and most turtles examined, slc26a12 was lost or pseudogenized. Phylogenetic analysis showed that Slc26a12 formed an independent branch with the other Slc26 members and Slc26a12, Slc26a1 and Slc26a2 formed a single branch, suggesting that these three members formed a subfamily in Slc26. In jawless fish, hagfish have two genes homologous to slc26a2 and slc26a12, whereas lamprey has a single gene homologous to slc26a2. African clawed frogs express slc26a12 in larval gills, skin, and fins. These results show that slc26a12 was present at least before the separation of lobe‐finned fish and tetrapods; the name slc26a12 is appropriate because the gene duplication occurred in the distant past.",11145369
"Epidemiological data on rare diseases in China are currently limited. The objective of this study was to provide a comprehensive understanding of the prevalence and incidence of rare diseases by systematically analyzing the available epidemiological data. We conducted a comprehensive search of English and Chinese databases, the Incidence and Prevalence Database, the Chinese Rare Disease Guideline, and the Taiwan Health Promotion Administration from 2010 to 2023. We identified the top diseases and regions based on epidemiological data and present the maximum, minimum, and median prevalence and incidence values in tables and forest plots. 1,264 prevalence and incidence data were retrieved from 277 studies, guidelines and official websites, covering 110 rare diseases (53.1%) and 32 regions (94.1%). In terms of geographical regions, incidence or prevalence data were available for 32 regions (94.1%), excluding Tibet Hui Autonomous Region and Macao Special Administrative Region. In terms of rate, 60 and 77 out of 207 diseases (29.0% and 37.2%) had available incidence and prevalence data, respectively. Eight diseases had an incidence rate equal to or greater than that of 1,000 patients per million. The present study provides a comprehensive epidemiological analysis and valuable insights into the prevalence and incidence of rare diseases in China. Our findings underscore the pressing need for sustained drug research and medical support for individuals and families impacted by rare diseases.",11145401
"Rapid onset obesity with hypoventilation, hypothalamic, and autonomic dysregulation (ROHHAD) syndrome in childhood is characterized by abrupt onset weight gain and dysautonomia with variable neuroendocrine involvement. In the absence of definitive disease-modifying therapies, the primary management strategy remains symptom control. This case report describes the first successful correction of obesity, dysautonomia, and metabolic derangement in a patient with ROHHAD following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Anthropometrics, metabolic profiling, and stool microbiome composition were assessed in a longitudinal fashion. In the 48-month period following surgery, the patient body mass index (BMI) reduced by 9.5 kg/m2 and metabolic status improved, evidenced in weaning of insulin, and improved glycated hemoglobin, lipid profile, and hepatic enzymes. Chronic diarrhea resolved after surgery and prior to significant weight loss. Evaluation of stool bacterial composition and biomass demonstrated shifts in absolute abundance and taxonomic composition in longitudinal samples following surgery. This case demonstrates the potential efficacy of bariatric surgery in correcting the metabolic disruption of ROHHAD syndrome, producing long-term changes in gut microbiome composition and biomass.",11146140
"Methylation-mediated gene silencing is closely related to the occurrence and development of human tumors. The euchromatic histone lysine methyltransferase 2 (EHMT2, also known as G9a) is highly expressed in many tumors and is generally considered to be an oncogene, which is associated with the poor outcome of many tumors. Combined immunotherapy and immune checkpoint blockade therapy also have good efficacy and certain safety. However, there are still many difficulties in the drugs targeting G9a, and the combined effect and safety of G9a with many drugs is still under study. This article aims to summarize the role and mechanism of G9a and its inhibitors in tumors in the past two years, and to understand the application prospect of G9a from the perspective of diagnosis and treatment.",11146345
"The study aimed to systematically evaluate the relationship between CYP3A5*3 gene polymorphisms and the blood concentration and effectiveness of tacrolimus (TAC) in patients with membranous nephropathy (MN). PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, Web of Science, China Biomedical, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang, Vipshop, ReadShow, Clinical Trials Registry, and other databases were searched. Studies on the relationship between CYP3A5*3 gene polymorphism and TAC blood concentration in MN patients were collected, and meta-analysis was performed using Stata 16 software.  A total of eight publications were included in the study, including 498 MN patients. CYP3A5*3 gene polymorphisms are associated with tacrolimus blood levels in patients with MN. The results of the relationship between CYP3A5*3 genotype polymorphisms and tacrolimus blood trough concentrations of the AA + AG genotype were lower than those of the GG genotype at ≤1 month [WMD = −2.08, 95% CI (−2.57, −1.59), p < 0.001] and 1–6 months [WMD = −0.63, 95% CI (−0.98, −0.27), p < 0.001]; however, they were not statistically significant at ≥6 months (p = 0.211). Furthermore, the subgroup analysis revealed that the dose-adjusted concentration of tacrolimus (C0/D) of the AA + AG genotype was lower than that of the GG genotype at ≤1 month [SMD = −1.93, 95% CI (−2.79, −1.08), p < 0.001], 1–6 months [SMD = −2.25, 95% CI (−2.71, −1.79), p < 0.001], and ≥6 months [SMD = −2.36, 95% CI (−2.86, −1.86), p < 0.001]. In addition, there was no statistically significant difference in effectiveness between the two groups at 3, 6, and 12 months of TAC administration (p > 0.05). Serum TAC concentrations in MN patients were correlated with CYP3A5*3 genotype polymorphisms. Detection of the CYP3A5*3 genotype before the administration of TAC may provide some clinical value for optimizing the treatment of MN patients. https://inplasy.com/, identifier [INPLASY202430083].",11148365
"This case report describes an exceptionally rare case in which a prior diagnosis of schizophrenia was later determined to be early-onset Fahr’s disease, linked to a genetic mutation in the SLC20A2 gene. Initially, the patient exhibited symptoms resembling schizophrenia, including aggression and hostility, and was highly susceptible to medication side effects such as restlessness and Parkinsonism. Despite maintaining independent activities of daily living, his neurological examinations revealed hidden weakness on the left side. Following adjustments to the medication regimen, stability was achieved with residual psychotic symptoms under treatment with Risperidone 1.5mg/day, Valproic acid 1500mg/day, and Quetiapine 37.5mg/day. This case underscores the importance of conducting comprehensive imaging studies at the time of initial psychiatric diagnosis, regardless of the apparent typicality of the presentation. Additionally, it emphasizes the need for patience and adherence to the “Start Low and Go Slow” approach in medication management to minimize the risk of exacerbating psychiatric symptoms and aggression.",11148442
"The efficacy of anthracycline-based chemotherapeutics, which include doxorubicin and its structural relatives daunorubicin and idarubicin, remains almost unmatched in oncology, despite a side effect profile including cumulative dose-dependent cardiotoxicity, therapy-related malignancies and infertility. Detoxifying anthracyclines while preserving their anti-neoplastic effects is arguably a major unmet need in modern oncology, as cardiovascular complications that limit anti-cancer treatment are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among the 17 million cancer survivors in the U.S. In this study, we examined different clinically relevant anthracycline drugs for a series of features including mode of action (chromatin and DNA damage), bio-distribution, anti-tumor efficacy and cardiotoxicity in pre-clinical models and patients. The different anthracycline drugs have surprisingly individual efficacy and toxicity profiles. In particular, aclarubicin stands out in pre-clinical models and clinical studies, as it potently kills cancer cells, lacks cardiotoxicity, and can be safely administered even after the maximum cumulative dose of either doxorubicin or idarubicin has been reached. Retrospective analysis of aclarubicin used as second-line treatment for relapsed/refractory AML patients showed survival effects similar to its use in first line, leading to a notable 23% increase in 5-year overall survival compared to other intensive chemotherapies. Considering individual anthracyclines as distinct entities unveils new treatment options, such as the identification of aclarubicin, which significantly improves the survival outcomes of AML patients while mitigating the treatment-limiting side-effects. Building upon these findings, an international multicenter Phase III prospective study is prepared, to integrate aclarubicin into the treatment of relapsed/refractory AML patients.

"The FGFR signaling pathway is integral to cellular activities, including proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Dysregulation of this pathway is implicated in numerous human cancers, positioning FGFR as a prominent therapeutic target. Here, we conduct a comprehensive review of the function, signaling pathways and abnormal alterations of FGFR, as well as its role in tumorigenesis and development. Additionally, we provide an in-depth analysis of pivotal phase 2 and 3 clinical trials evaluating the performance and safety of FGFR inhibitors in oncology, thereby shedding light on the current state of clinical research in this field. Then, we highlight four drugs that have been approved for marketing by the FDA, offering insights into their molecular mechanisms and clinical achievements. Our discussion encompasses the intricate landscape of FGFR-driven tumorigenesis, current techniques for pinpointing FGFR anomalies, and clinical experiences with FGFR inhibitor regimens. Furthermore, we discuss the inherent challenges of targeting the FGFR pathway, encompassing resistance mechanisms such as activation by gatekeeper mutations, alternative pathways, and potential adverse reactions. By synthesizing the current evidence, we underscore the potential of FGFR-centric therapies to enhance patient prognosis, while emphasizing the imperative need for continued research to surmount resistance and optimize treatment modalities.",11149307
"We employed single‐cell analysis techniques, specifically the inferCNV method, to dissect the complex progression of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) from adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) through minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA) to invasive adenocarcinoma (IAC). This approach enabled the identification of Cluster 6, which was significantly associated with LUAD progression. Our comprehensive analysis included intercellular interaction, transcription factor regulatory networks, trajectory analysis, and gene set variation analysis (GSVA), leading to the development of the lung progression associated signature (LPAS). Interestingly, we discovered that the LPAS not only accurately predicts the prognosis of LUAD patients but also forecasts genomic alterations, distinguishes between ‘cold’ and ‘hot’ tumours, and identifies potential candidates suitable for immunotherapy. PSMB1, identified within Cluster 6, was experimentally shown to significantly enhance cancer cell invasion and migration, highlighting the clinical relevance of LPAS in predicting LUAD progression and providing a potential target for therapeutic intervention. Our findings suggest that LPAS offers a novel biomarker for LUAD patient stratification, with significant implications for improving prognostic accuracy and guiding treatment decisions.",11149493
"Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD), a member of highly lethal malignant tumors, has a poor outcome and extremely poor prognosis. The transient receptor potential (TRP) superfamily, a group of nonselective cation channels, is capable of influencing cellular functions by regulating calcium homeostasis. In addition, it has been shown that TRP channels can also affect various cellular phenotypes by regulating gene transcription levels and are involved in the development of a variety of malignant tumors. In order to find new therapeutic targets and biomarkers to improve the clinical prognosis of pancreatic cancer, we performed genetic and immunological characterization of TRP channels in PAAD, as well as related functional and prognostic analyses. We investigated the expression, genetic alterations, methylation levels, and immune infiltration levels of TRP channels in PAAD, and further also analyzed the function of TRP channels in PAAD and their prognostic value for PAAD patients. Our results suggest that TRPM8 may contribute to tumor proliferation by controlling the PI3K‐AKT–mTOR signaling pathway in PAAD. After careful evaluation of the accumulated data, we concluded that TRPM8 has potential as a prognostic indicator and prospective therapeutic target in PAAD.",11150080
"Thyroid surgery in pediatric population is not as common as that in adults, although they share the same indications, techniques and complications. This review aims to evaluate the surgical management of thyroid disease in patients under 18 years old. We conducted a bibliographic search in the international literature. Data from the identified studies such as demographics, indication for surgery, type of procedure, complications and length of hospital stay were recorded. A retrospective review study of all patients under 18 years old who underwent thyroidectomy was performed. We included 37 retrospective studies and a total of 12,728 patients. Thyroidectomy was more common in female patients and the mean age was approximately 14 years old. The leading indication for surgery was benign thyroid pathology. Due to the surgical treatments’ safety and effectiveness in young patients, total and subtotal thyroidectomy, whether for malignancies or benign diseases, is becoming more popular today. The most often occurring complication of pediatric thyroid surgery is hypoparathyroidism. Despite the high likelihood of recurrence of pediatric malignancies, overall survival rates of pediatric thyroid cancer are excellent. Thyroidectomy performed by high-volume thyroid surgeons in children and adolescents is considered an efficient and safe method of treatment of thyroid disease.",11150202
"According to the PRISMA criteria, a systematic review has been conducted to investigate the clinical relevance between patients with severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) and cyclic congenital neutropenia (CyN) induced by ELANE mutations. We have searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane, CNKI, Wanfang Medicine, and VIP for ELANE mutation related literature published from 1997 to 2022. Using Microsoft Excel collect and organize data, SPSS 25, GraphPad Prism 8.0.1, and Omap analyze and plot statistical. Compare the gender, age, geography, mutation sites, infection characteristics, treatment, and other factors of SCN and CyN patients induced by ELANE mutations, with a focus on exploring the relationship between genotype and clinical characteristics, genotype and prognosis. This study has included a total of 467 patients with SCN and 90 patients with CyN. The onset age of SCN and CyN are both less than 1 year old, and the onset and diagnosis age of SCN are both younger than CyN. The mutation of ELANE gene is mainly missense mutation, and hot spot mutations include S126L, P139L, G214R, c.597+1G>A. The high-frequency mutations with severe outcomes are A57V, L121H, L121P, c.597+1G>A, c.597+1G>T, S126L, C151Y, C151S, G214R, C223X. Respiratory tract, skin and mucosa are the most common infection sites, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli are the most common. Patients with refractory G-CSF are more likely to develop severe outcomes. The commonly used pre-treatment schemes for transplantation are Bu-Cy-ATG and Flu-Bu-ATG.

"Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder characterized by recurrent epilepsy episodes. As a non-pharmacological treatment, the ketogenic diet has been widely applied in treating epilepsy. However, the exact therapeutic mechanism of the ketogenic diet for epilepsy remains unclear. This study investigates the molecular mechanisms of the ketogenic diet in regulating fatty acid metabolism and activating the ADCY3-initiated cAMP signaling pathway to enhance neuronal inhibition and thereby treat epilepsy. Meta-analysis reveals that the ketogenic diet is superior to the conventional diet in treating epilepsy. Animal experiments demonstrate that the ketogenic diet is more effective than the conventional diet in treating epilepsy, with the best results achieved using the classic ketogenic diet. Transcriptome sequencing analysis identifies six essential genes, among which ADCY3 shows increased expression in the ketogenic diet. In vivo experiments confirm that the activation of the cAMP-PKA signaling pathway by ADCY3 enhances neuronal inhibition and improves epilepsy control. Clinical observations indicate that the ketogenic diet improves patient epilepsy episodes by regulating the ADCY3-initiated cAMP signaling pathway.",11150708
"Chronic hepatitis B poses a significant global burden, modulating immune cells, leading to chronic inflammation and long-term damage. Due to its hepatotropism, the hepatitis B virus (HBV) cannot infect other cells. The mechanisms underlying the intercellular communication among different liver cells in HBV-infected individuals and the immune microenvironment imbalance remain elusive. Exosomes, as important intercellular communication and cargo transportation tools between HBV-infected hepatocytes and immune cells, have been shown to assist in HBV cargo transportation and regulate the immune microenvironment. However, the role of exosomes in hepatitis B has only gradually received attention in recent years. Minimal literature has systematically elaborated on the role of exosomes in reshaping the immune microenvironment of the liver. This review unfolds sequentially based on the biological processes of exosomes: exosomes’ biogenesis, release, transport, uptake by recipient cells, and their impact on recipient cells. We delineate how HBV influences the biogenesis of exosomes, utilizing exosomal covert transmission, and reshapes the hepatic immune microenvironment. And based on the characteristics and functions of exosomes, potential applications of exosomes in hepatitis B are summarized and predicted.",11151510
"The rapid progression of genomics and proteomics has been driven by the advent of advanced sequencing technologies, large, diverse, and readily available omics datasets, and the evolution of computational data processing capabilities. The vast amount of data generated by these advancements necessitates efficient algorithms to extract meaningful information.

This review provides an overview of the methods, applications, and significance of k-mers in genomic and proteomic data analyses, as well as the utility of absent sequences, including nullomers and nullpeptides, in disease detection, vaccine development, therapeutics, and forensic science. Therefore, the review highlights the pivotal role of k-mers in addressing current genomic and proteomic problems and underscores their potential for future breakthroughs in research.",11152613
"Many types of gynecological cancer (GC) are often silent until they reach an advanced stage, and are therefore often diagnosed too late for effective treatment. Hence, there is a real need for more efficient diagnosis and treatment for patients with GC. During recent years, researchers have increasingly studied the impact of microRNAs cancer development, leading to a number of applications in detection and treatment. MicroRNAs are a particular group of tiny RNA molecules that regulate regular gene expression by affecting the translation process. The downregulation of numerous miRNAs has been observed in human malignancies. Let-7 is an example of a miRNA that controls cellular processes as well as signaling cascades to affect post-transcriptional gene expression. Recent research supports the hypothesis that enhancing let-7 expression in those cancers where it is downregulated may be a potential treatment option. Exosomes are tiny vesicles that move through body fluids and can include components like miRNAs (including let-7) that are important for communication between cells. Studies proved that exosomes are able to enhance tumor growth, angiogenesis, chemoresistance, metastasis, and immune evasion, thus suggesting their importance in GC management. Impact of let-7 on female malignancies and diseases of the female reproductive tract. Let-7 expression is dysregulated in a variety of gynaecological and obstetric disorders.",11153289
"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide and is prevalent in East Asia. Although genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of HCC have identified 23 risk regions, the susceptibility genes underlying these associations largely remain unclear. To identify novel candidate genes for HCC, we conducted liver single-tissue and cross-tissue transcriptome-wide association studies (TWASs) in two populations of East Asia. GWAS summary statistics of 2,514 subjects (1,161 HCC cases and 1,353 controls) from the Chinese Qidong cohort and 161,323 subjects (2,122 HCC cases and 159,201 controls) from the BioBank Japan project were used to conduct TWAS analysis. The single-tissue and cross-tissue TWAS approaches were both used to detect the association between susceptible genes and the risk of HCC. TWAS identified genes were further annotated by Metascape, UALCAN, GEPIA2, and DepMap. We identified 22 novel genes at 16 independent loci significantly associated with HCC risk after Bonferroni correction. Of these, 13 genes were located in novel regions. Besides, we found 83 genes overlapped in the Chinese and Japanese cohorts with P < 0.05, of which, three genes (NUAK2, HLA-DQA1, and ATP6V1G2) were discerned by both single-tissue and cross-tissue TWAS approaches. Among the genes identified through TWAS, a significant proportion of them exhibit a credible role in HCC biology, such as FAM96B, HSPA5, POLRMT, MPHOSPH10, and RABL2A. HLA-DQA1, NUAK2, and HSPA5 associated with the process of carcinogenesis in HCC as previously reported. Our findings highlight the value of leveraging the gene expression data to identify new candidate genes beyond the GWAS associations and could further provide a genetic insight for the biology of HCC.",11153834
"OMIM 273750 (3-M) syndrome is a rare cause of severe short stature with variable dysmorphic features caused by pathogenic variants in several genes including cullin7 gene (CUL7). Hypogonadism and hypospadias have been described in only a few males. We report a patient with CUL7 pathogenic variant who had bifid scrotum and perineal hypospadias at birth. He entered puberty spontaneously at age 12 years and appropriately completed pubertal development by 15 years. Subsequently, a regression of testicular volumes, increased gonadotropin levels, and reduced (although normal) testosterone levels were observed. This case highlights the importance of careful pubertal monitoring as pubertal dysfunction may be associated with 3-M syndrome.",11154130
"Epigenetic control systems are based on chromatin modifications (DNA methylation, histone modifications and nucleosome positioning), which affect the local kinetics of gene expression. They play an important role in maintaining cell fate decisions, X inactivation and genomic imprinting. Aberrant chromatin states that are associated with a deleterious change in gene expression are called epimutations. An epimutation can be a primary epimutation that has occurred in the absence of any genetic change or a secondary epimutation that results from a mutation of a cis-acting regulatory element or trans-acting factor. Epimutations may play a causative role in disease, for example in imprinting disorders, or may be part of the pathogenetic mechanism as in the fragile X syndrome and in syndromes caused by a mutation affecting a chromatin modifier. For several diseases, DNA methylation testing is an important tool in the diagnostic work-up of patients.",11154187
"Leukemia is a heterogeneous group of life‐threatening malignant disorders of the hematopoietic system. Immunotherapy, radiotherapy, stem cell transplantation, targeted therapy, and chemotherapy are among the approved leukemia treatments. Unfortunately, therapeutic resistance, side effects, relapses, and long‐term sequelae occur in a significant proportion of patients and severely compromise the treatment efficacy. The development of novel approaches to improve outcomes is therefore an unmet need. Recently, novel leukemia drug discovery strategies, including targeted protein degradation, have shown potential to advance the field of personalized medicine for leukemia patients. Specifically, PROteolysis‐TArgeting Chimeras (PROTACs) are revolutionary compounds that allow the selective degradation of a protein by the ubiquitin–proteasome system. Developed against a wide range of cancer targets, they show promising potential in overcoming many of the drawbacks associated with conventional therapies. Following the exponential growth of antileukemic PROTACs, this article reviews PROTAC‐mediated degradation of leukemia‐associated targets. Chemical structures, in vitro and in vivo activities, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and clinical trials of PROTACs are critically discussed. Furthermore, advantages, challenges, and future perspectives of PROTACs in leukemia are covered, in order to understand the potential that these novel compounds may have as future drugs for leukemia treatment.",11154823
"Dynactin subunit 2 (DCTN2) has been reported to play a role in progression of several tumours; however, the involvement of DCTN2 in potential mechanism or the tumour immune microenvironment among various cancers still remains largely unknown. Therefore, the objective of this study was to comprehensively investigate the expression status and potential function of DCTN2 in various malignancies through different database, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas, the Genotype‐Tissue Expression and Gene Expression Omnimus databases. We discovered that DCTN2 expression was high in many type of tumours tissues compared to adjacent non‐tumour ones. High DCTN2 signified poor prognosis for patients with tumours. Additionally, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) analysis revealed that DCTN2 was positively correlated with oncogenic pathways, including cell cycle, tumour metastasis‐related pathway, while it was negatively with anti‐tumour immune signalling pathway, such as INF‐γ response. More importantly, we elucidated the functional impact of DCTN2 on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression and its underlying mechanisms. DCTN2 expression was much higher in HCC tissues than in adjacent non‐tumour tissues. Silencing DCTN2 dramatically suppressed the proliferative and metastasis capacities of tumour cell in vitro. Mechanistically, DCTN2 exerted tumour‐promoting effects by modulating the AKT signalling pathway. DCTN2 knockdown in HCC cells inhibited AKT phosphorylation and its downstream targets as well. Rescue experiments revealed that the anti‐tumour effects of DCTN2 knockdown were partially reversed upon AKT pathway activation. Overall, DCTN2 may be a potent biomarker signifying tumour prognosis and a promising therapeutic target for tumour treatment, particularly in HCC.",11154834
"Sex hormones and sex chromosomes play a vital role in cardiovascular disease. Testosterone plays a crucial role in men’s health. Lower testosterone level is associated with cardiovascular and cardiometabolic diseases, including inflammation, atherosclerosis, and type 2 diabetes. Testosterone replacement is beneficial or neutral to men’s cardiovascular health. Testosterone deficiency is associated with cardiovascular events. Testosterone supplementation to hypogonadal men improves libido, increases muscle strength, and enhances mood. We hypothesized that sex chromosomes (XX and XY) interaction with testosterone plays a role in arterial stiffening. We used four core genotype male mice to understand the inherent contribution of sex hormones and sex chromosome complement in arterial stiffening. Age-matched mice were either gonadal intact or castrated at eight weeks plus an additional eight weeks to clear endogenous sex hormones. This was followed by assessing blood pressure, pulse wave velocity, echocardiography, and ex vivo passive vascular mechanics. Arterial stiffening but not blood pressure was more significant in castrated than testes-intact mice independent of sex chromosome complement. Castrated mice showed a leftward shift in stress–strain curves and carotid wall thinning. Sex chromosome complement (XX) in the absence of testosterone increased collagen deposition in the aorta and Kdm6a gene expression. Testosterone deprivation increases arterial stiffening and vascular wall remodeling. Castration increases Col1α1 in male mice with XX sex chromosome complement. Our study shows decreased aortic contractile genes in castrated mice with XX than XY sex chromosomes.

"Network pharmacology and molecular docking methods were used in the present study to clarify the molecular mechanism of two traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions of climacteric syndrome. Based on oral availability and drug similarity, the main active components of Erzhi Pill and Erxian Decoction were screened through the platform of traditional Chinese medicine system pharmacology. The target database of climacteric syndrome was established by using GENECARD, OMIM, PharmGKB, Targets and Drugbank. The “component – target” network diagram was constructed using Cytoscape software (version 3.8.2). Topology analysis, module analysis, and GO and KEGG enrichment analyses were used to explore the core target and action pathway of Erzhi Pill-Erxian Decoction for treating climacteric syndrome of same disease with different treatments. There were 16 active components and 103 corresponding targets found in Erzhi Pill; 69 active components and 121 corresponding targets were found in Erxian Decoction; and 100 potential targets were found in Erzhi Pill and Erxian Decoction. Through network analysis, topology and module analysis, TP53, AKT1, Jun, ESR1, IL1B, CASP3, MMP9, PTGS2, HIF1A, MYC and EGFR could be considered as potential targets of the 2 prescriptions for alleviating climacteric syndrome. The effects of Erzhi pill and Erxian Decoction on climacteric syndrome are mainly in the pathway of lipid and atherosclerosis, AGE-RAGE signaling pathway and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway in diabetic complications. The active components in Erzhi Pill - Erxian Decoction, such as quercetin, show considerable potential as a candidate drug for the treatment of climacteric syndrome.",11155544
"The obesity epidemic continues to increase, with half of US women predicted to be obese by 2030. Women with obesity are at increased risk for not only cardiovascular and liver disease, but also reproductive disorders. Although mouse models are useful in studying the effects of obesity, there is inconsistency in obesity-induction methods, diet composition, and mouse strains, and studies using female mice are limited. In this study, we sought to compare the effects of a 45% high-fat diet (HFD) versus a 60% HFD on the uterine estrous cycle of nulligravid C57BL/6J mice. For 22 weeks, we placed a total of 20 mice on either a 60% HFD, 45% HFD, or each HFD-matched control diet (CD). Both HFDs produced significant weight gain, with 60% HFD and 45% HFD gaining significant weight after 2 weeks and 15 weeks, respectively. Additionally, both HFDs led to glucose intolerance, fatty liver, and adipocyte hypertrophy. Mice fed 60% HFD displayed hyperphagia in the first 12 weeks of HFD treatment. Moreover, 60% HFD-treated mice had a longer estrous cycle length and an increased percentage of estrus stage samplings compared to CD-treated mice. Estrous cycle stage-controlled 60% HFD-treated mice displayed an increased estrogen-to-progesterone ratio and decreased ovarian corpora lutea compared to CD-treated mice, which may underlie the observed estrous cycle differences. There was no significant difference between diets regarding endometrial morphology or the percent of endometrial CD45+ immune cells. Our results indicate that consideration is needed when selecting a HFD-induced obesity mouse model for research involving female reproductive health.",11156617
"During the process of transition from paediatric to adult health care, counselling concerning fertility is an important issue and is based mainly on serum markers of gonadal function. Here, we analysed these markers in adolescents with various underlying endocrine diseases at the time of transition. After reaching near adult height and late puberty (girls: bone age [BA] ≥14 years, and boys: BA ≥16 years), we assessed stages of puberty according to Tanner and measured testes or ovarian volumes and serum markers of gonadal function (anti‐Mullerian hormone [AMH], inhibin B, 17β‐estradiol, testosterone). One hundred and ten patients (56 females and 54 males) were included from May 2010 to March 2016 with multiple pituitary hormone deficiency (MPHD; n = 17), growth hormone deficiency (GHD; n = 35), Turner syndrome (TS; n = 27), short stature after being born small for gestational age (SGA; n = 20) and Klinefelter syndrome (KS; n = 11). Female and male adolescents exhibited mature secondary sexual characteristics. The levels of serum inhibin B and AMH were lower in TS and female MPHD than in GHD and SGA, each independently (p < 0.05). The levels of serum AMH were higher whereas serum inhibin B were lower in male MPHD and KS (p < 0.05). Ovary volumes were significantly smaller in patients with TS, and testicular volumes were smaller in patients with KS. After current established treatments with sex steroids, the development of secondary sexual characteristics was mature. However, impaired markers of fertility have been identified in patients with TS, KS and MPHD, reflecting gonadal dysgenesis in TS and KS, but gonadal immaturity in MPHD as gonadal gonadotropin stimulation is lacking throughout development. Consequently, in patients with MPHD, these markers cannot reliably predict individual fertility, which warrants consideration and incorporation in future treatment concepts.",11157144
"Endometriosis is a common gynecological disease affecting women of reproductive age. Patients with endometriosis frequently experience severe chronic pain and have higher chances to experience infertility. Progesterone resistance is a major problem that develops during the medical treatment of endometriosis, which often leads to treatment failure of hormonal therapies. Previous studies indicated that the dysregulation of progesterone receptors (PR) is the primary factor leading to progesterone resistance in endometriosis. This review article systematically reviewed and summarized findings extracted from previously published papers available on PubMed, encompassing both experimental studies and clinical trials. Various determinants influencing PR expression in endometriosis have been identified, including the environmental toxins, microRNAs, cell signaling pathways, genetic mutations, and the pro‐inflammatory cytokines. The selective estrogen/progesterone receptor modulators have emerged as novel therapeutic approaches for treating endometriosis, offering potential improvements in overcoming progesterone resistance. Concerns and limitations persist despite the newly developed drugs. Therefore, studies on unraveling new therapeutic targets based on the molecular mechanisms of progesterone resistance is warranted for the development potential alternatives to overcome hormonal treatment failure in endometriosis.",11157498
"Studies evaluating genetic sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) in Hispanic and Latino populations using genomic technologies are lacking. Recent data has shown that Hispanic and Latino children display lower genetic diagnostic rates despite similar prevalence rates of SNHL to their Asian and White counterparts, thus negatively affecting their clinical care. Our objective was to determine the genetic contribution to SNHL in a population of Mexican children undergoing evaluation for cochlear implantation. Pediatric patients from Mexico with severe to profound SNHL undergoing evaluation for cochlear implantation were recruited. Exome sequencing (ES) or hearing loss gene panel testing was performed. Variant pathogenicity was established in accordance to criteria established by the American College of Medical Genetics, and variants of interest were clinically confirmed via CLIA certified laboratory. Genetic evaluation was completed for 30 Mexican children with severe to profound SNHL. A genetic cause was identified for 47% (14) of probands, and 7% (2) probands had an inconclusive result. Of the diagnoses, 10 (71%) were syndromic or likely syndromic, and 4 (29%) were nonsyndromic. Eight probands (80% of all syndromic diagnoses) were diagnosed with a syndromic form of hearing loss that mimics a nonsyndromic clinical presentation at a young age and so could not be suspected based on clinical evaluation alone without genetic testing. This is the largest study to date to use comprehensive genomic testing for the evaluation of Mexican children with severe to profound SNHL. A significant proportion of children in this cohort were diagnosed with syndromic hearing loss. Future study in a larger cohort of Mexican children with varying degrees of hearing loss is required to improve the efficacy of genetic testing and timely medical intervention within these ethnically diverse populations. Level 4 (cohort study).",11160157
"Poly (ADP- ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) has been increasingly adopted for metastatic castration-resistance prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients with homologous recombination repair deficiency (HRD). However, it is unclear which PARPi is optimal in mCRPC patients with HRD in 2nd -line setting. We conducted a systematic review of trials regarding PARPi- based therapies on mCRPC in 2nd -line setting and performed a Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA). Radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) was assessed as primary outcome. PSA response and adverse events (AEs) were evaluated as secondary outcomes. Subgroup analyses were performed according to specific genetic mutation. Four RCTs comprised of 1024 patients (763 harbored homologous recombination repair (HRR) mutations) were identified for quantitative analysis. Regarding rPFS, olaparib monotherapy, rucaparib and cediranib plus olaparib showed significant improvement compared with ARAT. Olaparib plus cediranib had the highest surface under cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) scores (87.5%) for rPFS, followed by rucaparib, olaparib and olaparib plus abiraterone acetate prednisone. For patients with BRCA 1/2 mutations, olaparib associated with the highest probability (98.1%) of improved rPFS. For patients with BRCA-2 mutations, olaparib and olaparib plus cediranib had similar efficacy. However, neither olaparib nor rucaparib showed significant superior effectiveness to androgen receptor-axis-targeted therapy (ARAT) in patients with ATM mutations. For safety, olaparib showed significantly lower ≥ 3 AE rate compared with cediranib plus olaparib (RR: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.51, 0.97), while olaparib plus cediranib was associated with the highest risk of all-grade AE. PARPi-based therapy showed considerable efficacy for mCRPC patients with HRD in 2nd -line setting. However, patients should be treated accordingly based on their genetic background as well as the efficacy and safety of the selected regimen. : CRD42023454079.

"The potential anti-cancer effect of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) monomers has been widely studied due to their advantages of well-defined structure, clear therapeutic effects, and easy quality control during the manufacturing process. However, clinical trial information on these monomers is scarce, resulting in a lack of knowledge regarding the research progress, efficacy, and adverse reactions at the clinical stage. Therefore, this study systematically reviewed the clinical trials on the anti-cancer effect of TCM monomers registered in the Clinicaltrials.gov website before 2023.4.30, paying special attention to the trials on tumors, aiming to explore the research results and development prospects in this field. A total of 1982 trials were started using 69 of the 131 TCM monomers. The number of clinical trials performed each year showed an overall upward trend. However, only 26 monomers entered into 519 interventional anti-tumor trials, with vinblastine (194, 37.38%) and camptothecin (146, 28.13%) being the most used. A total of 45 tumors were studied in these 519 trials, with lymphoma (112, 21.58%) being the most frequently studied. Clinical trials are also unevenly distributed across locations and sponsors/collaborators. The location and the sponsor/collaborator with the highest number of performed trials were the United States (651,32.85%) and NIH (77). Therefore, China and its institutions still have large room for progress in promoting TCM monomers in anti-tumor clinical trials. In the next step, priority should be given to the improvement of the research and development ability of domestic enterprises, universities and other institutions, using modern scientific and technological means to solve the problems of poor water solubility and strong toxic and side effects of monomers, so as to promote the clinical research of TCM monomers.",11162644
"Kabuki syndrome (KS) is associated with congenital hyperinsulinism (HI). To characterize the clinical and molecular features of HI in children with KS. Retrospective cohort study of children with KS and HI evaluated between 1998 and 2023. The Congenital Hyperinsulinism Center of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Thirty-three children with KS and HI. HI presentation, treatment, course, and genotype. Hypoglycemia was recognized on the first day of life in 25 children (76%). Median age at HI diagnosis was 1.8 months (interquartile range [IQR], 0.6-6.1 months). Median age at KS diagnosis was 5 months (IQR, 2-14 months). Diagnosis of HI preceded KS diagnosis in 20 children (61%). Twenty-four children (73%) had a pathogenic variant in KMT2D, 5 children (15%) had a pathogenic variant in KDM6A, and 4 children (12%) had a clinical diagnosis of KS. Diazoxide trial was conducted in 25 children, 92% of whom were responsive. HI treatment was discontinued in 46% of the cohort at median age 2.8 years (IQR, 1.3-5.7 years). Hypoglycemia was recognized at birth in most children with KS and HI, but HI diagnosis was often delayed. HI was effectively managed with diazoxide in most children. In contrast to prior reports, the frequency of variants in KMT2D and KDM6A were similar to their overall prevalence in individuals with KS. Children diagnosed with KS should undergo evaluation for HI, and, because KS features may not be recognized in infancy, KMT2D and KDM6A should be included in the genetic evaluation of HI.",11163021
"Borderline ovarian tumours (BOTs) show intriguing characteristics distinguishing them from other ovarian tumours. The aim of the systematic review was to analyse the spectrum of molecular changes found in BOTs and discuss their significance in the context of the overall therapeutic approach. The systematic review included articles published between 2000 and 2023 in the databases: PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane. After a detailed analysis of the available publications, we qualified for the systematic review: 28 publications on proto-oncogenes: BRAF, KRAS, NRAS, ERBB2, and PIK3CA, 20 publications on tumour suppressor genes: BRCA1/2, ARID1A, CHEK2, PTEN, 4 on adhesion molecules: CADM1, 8 on proteins: B-catenin, claudin-1, and 5 on glycoproteins: E-Cadherin. In addition, in the further part of the systematic review, we included eight publications on microsatellite instability and three describing loss of heterozygosity in BOT. Molecular changes found in BOTs can vary on a case-by-case basis, identifying carcinogenic mutations through molecular analysis and developing targeted therapies represent significant advancements in the diagnosis and treatment of ovarian malignancies. Molecular studies have contributed significantly to our understanding of BOT pathogenesis, but substantial research is still required to elucidate the relationship between ovarian neoplasms and extraneous disease, identify accurate prognostic indicators, and develop targeted therapeutic approaches.",11163159
"It is unclear whether induced spike protein-specific antibodies due to infections with SARS-CoV-2 or to the prototypic Wuhan isolate-based vaccination can immune-react with the emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2. The main objective of the study was to measure the immunoreactivity of induced antibodies postvaccination with Covishield™ (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 coronavirus vaccines) or infections with SARS-CoV-2 by using selected peptides of the spike protein of wild type and variants of SARS-CoV-2. Thirty patients who had recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infections and 30 individuals vaccinated with both doses of Covishield™ were recruited for the study. Venous blood samples (5 mL) were collected at a single time point from patients within 3-4 weeks of recovery from SARS-CoV-2 infections or receiving both doses of Covishield™ vaccines. The serum levels of total immunoglobulin were measured in both study groups. A total of 12 peptides of 10 to 24 amino acids length spanning to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of wild type of SARS-CoV-2 and their variants were synthesized. The serum levels of immune-reactive antibodies were measured using these peptides. The serum levels of total antibodies were found to be significantly (p<0.001) higher in the vaccinated individuals as compared to COVID-19 recovered patients. Our study reported that the mutations in the RBD at the residues K417, E484, and N501 have been associated with reduced immunoreactivity with anti-sera of vaccinated people and COVID-19 recovered patients. The amino acid substitutions at the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 have been associated with a higher potential to escape the humoral immune response.",11163369
"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common type of malignant tumor where the prognosis is dismal. Circular RNA (CircRNA) is a novel RNA that regulates downstream gene transcription and translation to influence the progression of HCC. However, the regulatory relationship that exists between E3 ligases, which is a class of post-translational modifying proteins, and circRNA remains unclear. Based on the E3 ubiquitin ligase in the competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network, a circRNA-regulated E3 ubiquitin ligase signature (CRE3UL) was developed. A CRE3UL signature was created using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) and Cox regression analysis and merged it with clinicopathologic characteristics to generate a nomogram for prognosis prediction. The pRRophetic algorithm was utilized and immunological checkpoints were analyzed to compare the responses of patients in the high-risk group (HRG) and low-risk group (LRG) to targeted therapy and immunotherapy. Finally, experimental research will further elucidate the relationship between E3 ubiquitin ligase signature and HCC. HRG patients were found to have a worse prognosis than LRG patients. Furthermore, significant variations in prognosis were observed among different subgroups based on various clinical characteristics. The CRE3UL signature was identified as being an independent prognostic indicator. The nomogram that combined clinical characteristics and the CRE3UL signature was found to accurately predict the prognosis of HCC patients and demonstrated greater clinical utility than the current TNM staging approach. According to anticancer medication sensitivity predictions, the tumors of HRG patients were more responsive to gefitinib and nilotinib. From immune-checkpoint markers analysis, immunotherapy was identified as being more probable to assist those in the HRG. We found a significant correlation between the CRE3UL signature and the tumor microenvironment, enabling precise prognosis prediction for HCC patients. Additionally, a nomogram was developed that performs well in predicting the overall survival (OS) of HCC patients. This provides valuable guidance for clinicians in devising specific personalized treatment strategies.

"Infertility is an important late effect of childhood cancer treatment. Ovarian tissue cryopreservation (OTC) is established as a safe procedure to preserve gonadal tissue in (pre)pubertal girls with cancer at high risk for infertility. However, it is unclear whether elective laparoscopic OTC can also be performed safely in infants <1 year with cancer. This systematic review aims to evaluate the reported risks in infants undergoing elective laparoscopy regarding mortality, and/or critical events (including resuscitation, circulatory, respiratory, neurotoxic, other) during and shortly after surgery. This systematic review followed the Preferred reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline. A systematic literature search in the databases Pubmed and EMbase was performed and updated on February 15th, 2023. Search terms included ‘infants’, ‘intubation’, ‘laparoscopy’, ‘mortality’, ‘critical events’, ‘comorbidities’ and their synonyms. Papers published in English since 2000 and describing at least 50 patients under the age of 1 year undergoing laparoscopic surgery were included. Articles were excluded when the majority of patients had congenital abnormalities. Quality of the studies was assessed using the QUIPS risk of bias tool. The Pubmed and Embase databases yielded a total of 12,401 unique articles, which after screening on title and abstract resulted in 471 articles to be selected for full text screening. Ten articles met the inclusion criteria for this systematic review, which included 1778 infants <1 years undergoing elective laparoscopic surgery. Mortality occurred once (death not surgery-related), resuscitation in none and critical events in 53/1778 of the procedures. The results from this review illustrate that morbidity and mortality in infants without extensive comorbidities during and just after elective laparoscopic procedures seem limited, indicating that the advantages of performing elective laparoscopic OTC for infants with cancer at high risk of gonadal damage may outweigh the anesthetic and surgical risks of laparoscopic surgery in this age group.",11165185
"The members of the classic B7 family regulate the immune microenvironment of several malignant tumors. However, the potential relationship between the B7 family and the breast cancer (BrCa) tumor immune microenvironment has remained elusive. In the present study, we provide a comprehensive explanation of the expression, clinical significance, mutation, and immune cell infiltration of B7 family molecules in BrCa. First, we recruited 10 patients with BrCa surgery from the Wuxi Maternal and Child Health Hospital and performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis to investigate the distribution of B7 family members in multiple immune cell subsets. We focused on B7-2, B7-H3, and B7-H5 molecules of the B7 family and constructed tumor microarrays by self-recruiting patients to perform multiple immunohistochemical (mIHC) analyses and study tumor expression of B7-2, B7-H3, B7-H5 and CD8+ immune cell infiltration. B7-H5 displayed a strong correlation with CD8+ immune cell infiltration. In summary, B7-H5 provides a new perspective for the identification of immunothermal subtypes of BrCa and could function as a switch to reverse BrCa from an “immunologically cold” state to an “immunologically hot” state.",11165836
"Membrane trafficking, a fundamental cellular process encompassing the transport of molecules to specific organelles, endocytosis at the plasma membrane and protein secretion, is crucial for cellular homeostasis and signalling. Cancer cells adapt membrane trafficking to enhance their survival and metabolism, and understanding these adaptations is vital for improving patient responses to therapy and identifying therapeutic targets. In this Review, we provide a concise overview of major membrane trafficking pathways and detail adaptations in these pathways, including COPII-dependent endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-to-Golgi vesicle trafficking, COPI-dependent retrograde Golgi-to-ER trafficking and endocytosis, that have been found in cancer. We explore how these adaptations confer growth advantages or resistance to cell death and conclude by discussing the potential for utilising this knowledge in developing new treatment strategies and overcoming drug resistance for cancer patients.",11166456
"Our previous studies indicated that there is overexpression of MIAT in fibroids and MIAT is a sponge for the miR-29 family in these tumors. The objective of the present study was to determine if the knockdown of MIAT in fibroid xenografts will increase miR-29 levels and reduce the expression of genes targeted by this miRNA such as collagen and cell cycle regulatory proteins in a mouse model for fibroids. Ovariectomized CB-17 SCID/Beige mice bearing estrogen/progesterone pellets were implanted subcutaneously in the flank with equal weight of fibroid explants which had been transduced by lentivirus for either control (empty vector) or MIAT knockdown for four weeks (n=7). Knockdown of MIAT in fibroid xenografts resulted in a 30% reduction of tumor weight and a marked increase in miR-29a, -b, and -c levels in the xenografts. There was reduced cell proliferation and expression of cell cycle regulatory genes CCND1, CDK2, and E2F1 and no significant changes in apoptosis. The xenografts with MIAT knockdown expressed lower mRNA and protein levels of FN1, COL3A1, and TGF-β3, and total collagen protein. Targeting MIAT, which sponges the pro-fibrotic miR-29 family, is an effective therapy for fibroids by reducing cell proliferation and thereby, tumor growth and accumulation of ECM, which is a hallmark of these benign gynecologic tumors.",11166562
"Endoscopic ultrasound shear wave elastography (EUS‐SWE) can facilitate an objective evaluation of pancreatic fibrosis. Although it is primarily applied in evaluating chronic pancreatitis, its efficacy in assessing early chronic pancreatitis (ECP) remains underinvestigated. This study evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of EUS‐SWE for assessing ECP diagnosed using the Japanese diagnostic criteria 2019. In total, 657 patients underwent EUS‐SWE. Propensity score matching was used, and the participants were classified into the ECP and normal groups. ECP was diagnosed using the Japanese diagnostic criteria 2019. Pancreatic stiffness was assessed based on velocity (Vs) on EUS‐SWE, and the optimal Vs cutoff value for ECP diagnosis was determined. A practical shear wave Vs value of ≥50% was considered significant. Each group included 22 patients. The ECP group had higher pancreatic stiffness than the normal group (2.31 ± 0.67 m/s vs. 1.59 ± 0.40 m/s, p < 0.001). The Vs cutoff value for the diagnostic accuracy of ECP, as determined using the receiver operating characteristic curve, was 2.24m/s, with an area under the curve of 0.82 (95% confidence interval: 0.69–0.94). A high Vs was strongly correlated with the number of EUS findings (rs = 0.626, p < 0.001). Multiple regression analysis revealed that a history of acute pancreatitis and ≥2 EUS findings were independent predictors of a high Vs. There is a strong correlation between EUS‐SWE findings and the Japanese diagnostic criteria 2019 for ECP. Hence, EUS‐SWE can be an objective and invaluable diagnostic tool for ECP diagnosis.",11167156
"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2n first appeared in Wuhan, China in 2019. Soon after, it was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The health crisis imposed by a new virus and its rapid spread worldwide prompted the fast development of vaccines. For the first time in human history, two vaccines based on recombinant genetic material technology were approved for human use. These mRNA vaccines were applied in massive immunization programs around the world, followed by other vaccines based on more traditional approaches. Even though all vaccines were tested in clinical trials prior to their general administration, serious adverse events, usually of very low incidence, were mostly identified after application of millions of doses. Establishing a direct correlation (the cause‐effect paradigm) between vaccination and the appearance of adverse effects has proven challenging. This review focuses on the main adverse effects observed after vaccination, including anaphylaxis, myocarditis, vaccine‐induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia, Guillain–Barré syndrome, and transverse myelitis reported in the context of COVID‐19 vaccination. We highlight the symptoms, laboratory tests required for an adequate diagnosis, and briefly outline the recommended treatments for these adverse effects. The aim of this work is to increase awareness among healthcare personnel about the serious adverse events that may arise post‐vaccination. Regardless of the ongoing discussion about the safety of COVID‐19 vaccination, these adverse effects must be identified promptly and treated effectively to reduce the risk of complications.",11167235
"Genome‐wide approaches, such as whole‐exome sequencing (WES), are widely used to decipher the genetic mechanisms underlying inter‐individual variability in disease susceptibility. We aimed to dissect inborn monogenic determinants of idiopathic liver injury in otherwise healthy children. We thus performed WES for 20 patients presented with paediatric‐onset recurrent elevated transaminases (rELT) or acute liver failure (ALF) of unknown aetiology. A stringent variant screening was undertaken on a manually‐curated panel of 380 genes predisposing to inherited human diseases with hepatobiliary involvement in the OMIM database. We identified rare nonsynonymous variants in nine genes in six patients (five rELT and one ALF). We next performed a case‐level evaluation to assess the causal concordance between the gene mutated and clinical symptoms of the affected patient. A genetic diagnosis was confirmed in four rELT patients (40%), among whom two carried novel mutations in ACOX2 or PYGL, and two had previously‐reported morbid variants in ABCB4 or PHKA2. We also detected rare variants with uncertain clinical significance in CDAN1, JAG1, PCK2, SLC27A5 or VPS33B in rELT or ALF patients. In conclusion, implementation of WES improves diagnostic yield and enables precision management in paediatric cases of liver injury with unknown aetiology, in particular recurrent hypertransaminasemia.",11167704
"To characterize the phenotype and genotype of a Chinese family with autosomal‐dominant retinitis pigmentosa (RP) accompanied by iris coloboma. The proband, a 34‐year‐old male, was examined with his family by using fundus photography, optical coherence tomography (OCT), autofluorescence, and full‐field electroretinography (ffERG). Genetic analyses were conducted through whole‐exome sequencing (WES) to screen for variations. Three members of this Chinese family were shown to be bilateral iris coloboma. The male proband and his mother exhibited typical RP feature. The proband's late grandfather had been documented manifestation of iris coloboma. The mode of inheritance was confirmed to be autosomal dominance. Through linkage analysis and WES, a heterozygous variation in the miR‐204 gene (n.37C>T), a noncoding RNA gene, was identified in these three members. In this third independent and the first Asian family, the existence of a miR‐204 variant associated with RP accompanied by iris coloboma was confirmed. Our findings reinforce the significance of miR‐204 as an important factor influencing visual function in the retina. When phenotypes like RP accompanied by iris coloboma in an autosomal‐dominant pattern, including in Chinese patients, miR‐204 aberrations should be considered.",11169764
"Low-grade serous ovarian cancer (LGSOC) is a very rare histological subtype of serous ovarian cancer, representing ~2% of all epithelial ovarian cancer cases. LGSOC has a better prognosis but a lower response rate to chemotherapy in comparison to high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC). The present study is a retrospective review of the medical records of all patients with histologically proven LGSOC diagnosed and treated in a single institute between January 2003 and December 2019. A total of 23 patients diagnosed with LGSOC and treated at King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center (Riyadh, Saudi Arabia) were identified. The median age at diagnosis was 45.5 years (range, 26-66 years) and the median body mass index was 26.1 (range, 18-43). A total of 21 patients (91.3%) had de novo LGSOC, whereas only 2 patients (8.7%) had LGSOC that had transformed from serous borderline ovarian tumors and recurred. A total of 8 patients (34.8%) were diagnosed with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IV, whereas 3 (13.0%), 3 (13.0%) and 9 (39.1%) were diagnosed with stages I, II and III, respectively. In addition, 10 (43.5%), 5 (21.7%), and 3 (13.0%) patients had complete response, stable disease and partial response statuses after first-line therapy, respectively. At a median follow-up time of 34 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 25.32-42.69], the median progression-free survival (PFS) time was 75.2 months (95% CI, 17.35-133.05) and the median overall survival (OS) time was not reached. In conclusion, LGSOC exhibited better PFS and OS times than HGSOC as compared with data from the literature, and there is the option for systemic treatment (chemotherapy or hormonal therapy). Optimal cytoreduction showed numerically higher, but non-significant, PFS and OS times compared with suboptimal debulking; however, the optimal systemic chemotherapy or hormonal treatment remains controversial.",11170243
"Understanding the genetic makeup of microorganisms provides information on their evolutionary relationship with other similar organisms. It also sheds light on their ability to cause disease in susceptible individuals and to resist the hosts’ defense mechanisms, including the effects of antimicrobial therapy. In this study, we performed complete genome sequencing and characterization of bacteria called Arcanobacterium hippocoleae, which were isolated from the reproductive tract of infected mares. These bacteria displayed small and large phenotypes when grown on artificial media. The whole genome sequences between the large phenotypes were closely related, while the small and large types were distant from each other in terms of sequence size and identity. Putative genetic elements that might be associated with disease conditions were identified in both bacterial phenotypes. Several genes that express hypothetical proteins with unknown functions were also detected. This study provides the complete genetic structure and analysis of different phenotypes of Arcanobacterium hippocoleae and will serve as a benchmark for future studies to identify the potential function and role of the bacterial proteins in the ability of the bacterium to produce reproductive tract diseases in mares. Arcanobacterium hippocoleae is a Gram-positive fastidious bacterium and is occasionally isolated from the reproductive tract of apparently healthy mares (Equus caballus) or from mares with reproductive tract abnormalities. Apart from a few 16S rRNA gene-based GenBank sequences and one recent report on complete genome assembly, detailed genomic sequence and clinical experimental data are not available on the bacterium. Recently, we observed an unusual increase in the detection of the organism from samples associated with mare reproductive failures in Atlantic Canada. Two colony morphotypes (i.e., small, and large) were detected in culture media, which were identified as A. hippocoleae by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Here, we report the whole genome sequencing and characterization of the morphotype variants. The genome length of the large phenotypes was between 2.42 and 2.43, and the small phenotype was 1.99 Mbs. The orthologous nucleotide identity between the large colony phenotypes was ~99%, and the large and small colony phenotypes was between 77.86 and 78.52%, which may warrant the classification of the two morphotypes into different species. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA genes or concatenated housekeeping genes grouped the small and large colony variants into two different genotypic clusters. The UvrA protein, which is part of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) system, and 3-isopropoylmalate dehydratase small subunit protein expressed by the leuD gene were identified as potential virulence factors in the large and small colony morphotypes, respectively. However, detailed functional studies will be required to determine the exact roles of these and other identified hypothetical proteins in the cellular metabolism and potential pathogenicity of A. hippocoleae in mares.",11171008
"Immune checkpoints are essential to the body’s reaction to immunological stimuli. The most studied immune checkpoint molecules are programmed death (PD-1) with its ligand (PD-L1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) with its ligands CD80 (B7-1) and CD86 (B7-2). Certain tumours can evade immunosurveillance by activating these immunological checkpoint targets. These proteins are often upregulated in cancer cells and tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes, allowing cancer cells to escape immune surveillance and promote tumour growth. By blocking inhibitory checkpoints, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) can help restore the immune system to fight cancer effectively. Emerging studies in veterinary oncology are centred around developing and validating canine-targeted antibodies. Anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 treatments emerge as particularly promising among ICIs, reflecting the notable achievements in human medicine over the last decade. This article aims to review the current research literature about the expression of immune checkpoints in canine cancer and the current results of ICI treatment in dogs. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have revolutionised cancer treatment in people. Immune checkpoints are important regulators of the body’s reaction to immunological stimuli. The most studied immune checkpoint molecules are programmed death (PD-1) with its ligand (PD-L1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) with its ligands CD80 (B7-1) and CD86 (B7-2). Certain tumours can evade immunosurveillance by activating these immunological checkpoint targets. These proteins are often upregulated in cancer cells and tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes, allowing cancer cells to evade immune surveillance and promote tumour growth. By blocking inhibitory checkpoints, ICI can help restore the immune system to effectively fight cancer. Several studies have investigated the expression of these and other immune checkpoints in human cancers and have shown their potential as therapeutic targets. In recent years, there has been growing interest in studying the expression of immune checkpoints in dogs with cancer, and a few small clinical trials with ICI have already been performed on these species. Emerging studies in veterinary oncology are centred around developing and validating canine-targeted antibodies. Among ICIs, anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 treatments stand out as the most promising, mirroring the success in human medicine over the past decade. Nevertheless, the efficacy of caninized antibodies remains suboptimal, especially for canine oral melanoma. To enhance the utilisation of ICIs, the identification of predictive biomarkers for treatment response and the thorough screening of individual tumours are crucial. Such endeavours hold promise for advancing personalised medicine within veterinary practice, thereby improving treatment outcomes. This article aims to review the current research literature about the expression of immune checkpoints in canine cancer and the current results of ICI treatment in dogs.",11171034
"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths in the United States due to its late-stage diagnosis. Currently, there are no early diagnostic tests. The best treatment for PDAC is surgery, but by then, the cancer has already spread, making it difficult to perform. This study aims to address the potential of targeting neoantigens, unique cancer-specific proteins that trigger an immune response, as potential immunotherapy targets. However, PDAC develops characteristics such as immune cell avoidance, creating an environment suppressing immune cells, and converting cells to become unstable. Targeting neoantigens could revolutionize PDAC therapy, offering better survival rates. Though trials are still in the early stages, they do offer a greater understanding and potential for fighting cancer. This article hopes to shed light and pave the way for innovative treatments to improve the prognosis of PDAC patients. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the most common type of pancreatic cancer and is currently the third leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States after lung and colon cancer. PDAC is estimated to be the second leading cause of cancer-related death by 2030. The diagnosis at a late stage is the underlying cause for higher mortality and poor prognosis after surgery. Treatment resistance to chemotherapy and immunotherapy results in recurrence after surgery and poor prognosis. Neoantigen burden and CD8+ T-cell infiltration are associated with clinical outcomes in PDAC and paucity of neoantigen-reactive tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes may be the underlying cause for treatment resistance for immunotherapy. This suggests a need to identify additional neoantigens and therapies targeting these neoantigens to improve clinical outcomes in PDAC. In this review, we focus on describing the pathophysiology, current treatment strategies, and treatment resistance in PDAC followed by the need to target neoantigens in PDAC.",11171042
"Colorectal cancer (CRC) has become one of the leading causes of cancer-related morbidity and mortality worldwide. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and adoptive cell therapy (ACT) have been recently added to the clinical armamentarium of stage II/III diseases. Moreover, the improvement of a patient’s telomere status may have a synergistic effect along with ICIs/ACT. This can be achieved either via lifestyle modifications with increased physical activity or with new promising treatments such as those acting on telomerase. Therefore, this review aims to comprehensively summarize the current data on immunotherapy in order to facilitate clinicians’ familiarity with this relatively new therapeutic approach. Cancer of the colon and rectum (CRC) has been identified among the three most prevalent types of cancer and cancer-related deaths for both sexes. Even though significant progress in surgical and chemotherapeutic techniques has markedly improved disease-free and overall survival rates in contrast to those three decades ago, recent years have seen a stagnation in these improvements. This underscores the need for new therapies aiming to augment patient outcomes. A number of emerging strategies, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and adoptive cell therapy (ACT), have exhibited promising outcomes not only in preclinical but also in clinical settings. Additionally, a thorough appreciation of the underlying biology has expanded the scope of research into potential therapeutic interventions. For instance, the pivotal role of altered telomere length in early CRC carcinogenesis, leading to chromosomal instability and telomere dysfunction, presents a promising avenue for future treatments. Thus, this review explores the advancements in CRC immunotherapy and telomere-targeted therapies, examining potential synergies and how these novel treatment modalities intersect to potentially enhance each other’s efficacy, paving the way for promising future therapeutic advancements.",11171065
"This study aimed to identify and validate genes specific for the survival of patients with papillary renal cell carcinoma (PRCC) in the TCGA-KIRP and Korean-KIRP databases. Using machine learning with statistical analysis, 40 survival-specific genes were identified in TCGA-KIRP. Of them, 10 were verified as survival-specific genes for Korean-KIRP patients through next-generation sequencing. Among these, BAP1, PCSK2, and SPATA13 showed significant survival specificity in both overall survival and disease-free survival. Survival gene signatures, including PCSK2, which are commonly obtained from 40 gene signatures in TCGA and 10 gene signatures in Korean databases, are expected to provide insight into predicting the survival of PRCC patients and developing new treatments. Purpose: Papillary renal cell carcinoma (PRCC), the second most common kidney cancer, is morphologically, genetically, and molecularly heterogeneous with diverse clinical manifestations. Genetic variations of PRCC and their association with survival are not yet well-understood. This study aimed to identify and validate survival-specific genes in PRCC and explore their clinical utility. Materials and Methods: Using machine learning, 293 patients from the Cancer Genome Atlas-Kidney Renal Papillary Cell Carcinoma (TCGA-KIRP) database were analyzed to derive genes associated with survival. To validate these genes, DNAs were extracted from the tissues of 60 Korean PRCC patients. Next generation sequencing was conducted using a customized PRCC gene panel of 202 genes, including 171 survival-specific genes. Kaplan–Meier and Log-rank tests were used for survival analysis. Fisher’s exact test was performed to assess the clinical utility of variant genes. Results: A total of 40 survival-specific genes were identified in the TCGA-KIRP database through machine learning and statistical analysis. Of them, 10 (BAP1, BRAF, CFDP1, EGFR, ITM2B, JAK1, NODAL, PCSK2, SPATA13, and SYT5) were validated in the Korean-KIRP database. Among these survival gene signatures, three genes (BAP1, PCSK2, and SPATA13) showed survival specificity in both overall survival (OS) (p = 0.00004, p = 1.38 × 10−7, and p = 0.026, respectively) and disease-free survival (DFS) (p = 0.00002, p = 1.21 × 10−7, and p = 0.036, respectively). Notably, the PCSK2 mutation demonstrated survival specificity uniquely in both the TCGA-KIRP (OS: p = 0.010 and DFS: p = 0.301) and Korean-KIRP (OS: p = 1.38 × 10−7 and DFS: p = 1.21 × 10−7) databases. Conclusions: We discovered and verified genes specific for the survival of PRCC patients in the TCGA-KIRP and Korean-KIRP databases. The survival gene signature, including PCSK2 commonly obtained from the 40 gene signature of TCGA and the 10 gene signature of the Korean database, is expected to provide insight into predicting the survival of PRCC patients and developing new treatment.",11171119
"Hepatocellular carcinoma is the sixth most common cancer globally and is considered one of the deadliest health issues worldwide. The rapid emergence of HCC as a global health crisis has undergone a revolutionary change in treatment strategies. Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and angiogenic inhibitors, as monotherapy and in combination therapies have shown significant advancement to enhance patient outcomes across HCC stages. The effect of these treatments on cellular signaling pathways and immune responses offers promising potential for prolonged survival rates. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the deadliest emergent health issue around the globe. The stronger oncogenic effect, proteins, and weakened immune response are precisely linked with a significant prospect of developing HCC. Several conventional systemic therapies, antiangiogenic therapy, and immunotherapy techniques have significantly improved the outcomes for early-, intermediate-, and advanced-stage HCC patients, giving new hope for effective HCC management and prolonged survival rates. Innovative therapeutic approaches beyond conventional treatments have altered the landscape of managing HCC, particularly focusing on targeted therapies and immunotherapies. The advancement in HCC treatment suggested by the Food and Drug Administration is multidimensional treatment options, including multikinase inhibitors (sorafenib, lenvatinib, regorafenib, ramucirumab, and cabozantinib) and immune checkpoint inhibitors (atezolizumab, pembrolizumab, durvalumab, tremelimumab, ipilimumab, and nivolumab), in monotherapy and in combination therapy to increase life expectancy of HCC patients. This review highlights the efficacy of multikinase inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors in monotherapy and combination therapy through the analysis of phase II, and III clinical trials, targeting the key molecular pathways involved in cellular signaling and immune response for the prospective treatment of advanced and unresectable HCC and discusses the upcoming combinations of immune checkpoint inhibitors-tyrosine kinase inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors-vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors. Finally, the hidden challenges with pharmacological therapy for HCC, feasible solutions for the future, and implications of possible presumptions to develop drugs for HCC treatment are reported.",11171154
"Cancer-associated thrombosis (CAT) is a severe cause of mortality and morbidity in cancer patients, while active cancer is present in 20% of all patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE). CAT presents several peculiarities that distinguish this entity from other clinical settings associated with VTE. Management of thromboembolic events in CAT is extremely challenging because of the multifactorial pathophysiology of this clinical setting. The objective of this review is to enlighten the complicated pathophysiology of CAT, discuss the available biomarkers for early identification of high-risk patients, and summarize the current guidelines regarding the treatment and management of thrombotic events in cancer patients. Dysregulated hemostasis in cancer patients is associated with various clinical conditions, from thromboembolic complications to disseminated intravascular coagulation. Despite the well-established association between cancer and thromboembolic complications, the mechanisms involved are not completely elucidated. There are several predisposing factors in cancer for increased thrombus generation, such as immobilization and chemotherapy. The term cancer-associated thrombosis (CAT) has been introduced to describe the close bidirectional relationship between cancer and thromboembolic events. Conventional coagulation tests (PT/aPTT) are more accurate in detecting a hypocoagulable rather than a hypercoagulable state; thus, their contribution to CAT management is limited. Traditionally, D-dimer levels have been the most common laboratory study for the evaluation of thrombotic risk. However, D-dimer levels only display a snapshot of the coagulation cascade, and they cannot provide a dynamic evaluation of evolving clot formation. Non-conventional assays, such as viscoelastic methods and microparticle formation are promising tools for the identification of patients at risk for developing CAT. Recent guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology counsel against the estimation of thrombotic risk through a single test and recommend the use of scoring systems that take into account several risk factors. The present review outlines the current insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms of CAT and provides a comprehensive review of the latest advances in the laboratory assessment of CAT and the recent guidelines for the management of patients at risk for developing thromboembolic complications.",11171168
"MLH1 methylation status was accessed by a Pyrosequencing (PSQ) assay, and the results point to the efficacy of PSQ for evaluating MLH1 methylation. While unmethylation appears to be associated with a higher relapse rate, the survival rate does not seem to be influenced by methylation. Quantitative percentages suggest that elevated MLH1 methylation is linked to relapse and mortality, though a study with a larger sample size would be essential for statistically significant results. Background: In cancer care, the MLH1 gene is crucial for DNA mismatch repair (MMR), serving as a vital tumor suppressor. Evaluating MLH1 protein expression status, followed by analysis of MLH1 promoter methylation, has become a key diagnostic and prognostic approach. Our study investigates the complex link between MLH1 methylation and prognosis in endometrial adenocarcinoma (EA) patients. Methodology: MLH1 methylation status was accessed by a Pyrosequencing (PSQ) assay. Qualitative positivity for methylation was established if it exceeded the 11% cut-off; as well, a quantitative methylation analysis was conducted to establish correlations with clinicopathological data, relapse-free survival, and disease-free survival. Results: Our study revealed that 33.3% of patients without MLH1 methylation experienced relapses, surpassing the 23.3% in patients with methylation. Furthermore, 16.7% of patients without methylation succumbed to death, with a slightly higher rate of 17.6% in methylated patients. Qualitative comparisons highlighted that the mean methylation rate in patients experiencing relapse was 35.8%, whereas in those without relapse, it was 42.2%. This pattern persisted in disease-specific survival (DSS), where deceased patients exhibited a higher mean methylation level of 49.1% compared to living patients with 38.8%. Conclusions: Our findings emphasize the efficacy of PSQ for evaluating MLH1 methylation. While unmethylation appears to be associated with a higher relapse rate, the survival rate does not seem to be influenced by methylation. Quantitative percentages suggest that elevated MLH1 methylation is linked to relapse and mortality, though a study with a larger sample size would be essential for statistically significant results.",11171209
"Vulvar lymphomas are uncommon diseases and account for less than 0.5% of gynecological cancers and 1.5% of all NHLs. The various types of lymphomas have recently been identified as separate diseases and not as morphological variations of the same disease, according to the World Health Organization classification. They often represent the secondary localization of systemic disease, and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is the most common type. We also considered cases of vulvar T-cell lymphomas. The data analysis highlighted the difficulty of diagnosis and the need to resort to biopsy–histological examination, as well as molecular methods. The correctness of the diagnosis directly affects appropriate therapeutic management, which requires an adequate surgical approach that can be integrated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Since they are very rare tumors, lymphomas of the vulva are often not properly recognized. Patients with vulvar lymphoma are generally elderly and the classical manifestation of the disease is a vulvar mass. No significant age differences have been found between primary and secondary lymphoma. To make a correct diagnosis, it is therefore necessary to use not only histological examination but also the genetic and molecular profile in order to establish optimal therapeutic management. Literature analysis confirm the good prognosis of this disease.",11171216
"Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs) and lung NETs (LNETs) have garnered increased attention in recent years due to their diverse clinical manifestations and challenging management. Although the vast majority of both PanNETs and LNETs are sporadic, they can also occur in the context of inherited syndromes that necessitate a high index of suspicion as the course of the disease is different and there are additional clinical implications for other family members. Our systematic review encompasses studies conducted over the past decade, focusing on the incidence, diagnosis, and treatment of PanNETs and/or LNETs encountered in hereditary syndromes such as Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 1 (MEN1), MEN4, von Hippel–Lindau (VHL), Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC), and Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). We discuss the importance of early detection and tailored management strategies, emphasizing the need for multidisciplinary collaboration among relevant healthcare professionals to optimize patients’ outcomes. Moreover, we highlight the importance of active surveillance strategies for early tumor detection in high-risk individuals and the evolving landscape of personalized medicine for targeted intervention. Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs) and lung NETs (LNETs) represent a rare but clinically significant subgroup of neoplasms. While the majority is sporadic, approximately 17% of PanNETs and a subset of LNETs develop in the context of monogenic familial tumor syndromes, especially multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) syndrome. Other inherited syndromes associated with PanNETs include MEN4, von Hippel–Lindau (VHL) syndrome, neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). These syndromes are highly penetrant and their clinical manifestations may vary even among members of the same family. They are attributed to genetic mutations involving key molecular pathways regulating cell growth, differentiation, and angiogenesis. Pancreatic NETs in hereditary syndromes are often multiple, develop at a younger age compared to sporadic tumors, and are associated with endocrine and nonendocrine tumors derived from multiple organs. Lung NETs are not as common as PanNETs and are mostly encountered in MEN1 syndrome and include typical and atypical lung carcinoids. Early detection of PanNETs and LNETs related to inherited syndromes is crucial, and specific follow-up protocols need to be employed to optimize diagnosis and management. Genetic screening is recommended in childhood, and diagnostic screening starts often in adolescence, even in asymptomatic mutation carriers. Optimal management and therapeutic decisions should be made in the context of a multidisciplinary team in specialized centers, whereas specific biomarkers aiming to identify patients denoted to follow a more aggressive course need to be developed.",11171219
"Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecological cancer. However, advanced and recurrent cancers are less sensitive to chemotherapy and have poor prognoses. Therefore, new treatment strategies are being explored. Recently, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have been used in treating various cancers. Although AT-rich interaction domain 1A (ARID1A) negativity has been proposed as a new biomarker for immune checkpoint inhibitors, there have been no reports on ARID1A biomarkers in endometrial cancer. Therefore, we investigated whether ARID1A negativity predicts the efficacy of ICIs in treating endometrial cancer. We assessed ARID1A expression and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (CD8+) and immune checkpoint molecules (PD-L1/PD-1) using immunostaining and MSI analysis. Throughout our experiment, CD8 and PD-1 expression did not differ significantly between the ARID1A-negative and ARID1A-positive groups. Our findings suggest that ARID1A negativity may not be a suitable biomarker for ICI efficacy in endometrial cancer. Background: AT-rich interaction domain 1A (ARID1A) has been proposed as a new biomarker for predicting response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). The predictive value of ARID1A for predicting ICI effectiveness has not been reported for endometrial cancer. Therefore, we investigated whether ARID1A negativity predicts ICI effectiveness for endometrial cancer treatment. Methods: We evaluated ARID1A expression, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (CD8+), and immune checkpoint molecules (PD-L1/PD-1) by immunostaining endometrial samples from patients with endometrial cancer. Samples in which any of the four mismatch repair proteins (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2) were determined to be negative via immunostaining were excluded. In the ARID1A-negative group, microsatellite instability (MSI) status was confirmed via MSI analysis. Results: Of the 102 samples investigated, 25 (24.5%) were ARID1A-negative. CD8 and PD-1 expression did not differ significantly between the ARID1A-negative group and the ARID1A-positive group; however, the ARID1A-negative group showed significantly lower PD-L1 expression. Only three samples (14.2%) in the ARID1A-negative group showed high MSI. Sanger sequencing detected three cases of pathological mutation in the MSH2-binding regions. We also established an ARID1A-knockout human ovarian endometriotic epithelial cell line (HMOsisEC7 ARID1A KO), which remained microsatellite-stable after passage. Conclusion: ARID1A negativity is not suitable as a biomarker for ICI effectiveness in treating endometrial cancer.",11171230
"Breast MRI is a valuable imaging modality that plays a critical role in the detection, diagnosis, and treatment of breast cancer. The superior sensitivity of breast MRI allows for more accurate evaluation of the extent of disease for breast cancer, which is important in an era where de-escalation of treatment is being considered and offered. In this review, we provided a detailed overview of breast MRI and its clinical utility in the management of breast cancer as a foundation for its use in the field of radiation oncology. Specifically, we describe breast MRI technique, anatomy, common breast MR imaging findings, and the role of breast MRI in assessing extent of disease and tumor response to neoadjuvant therapy. There has been increased interest in the use of MRI during radiotherapy treatment planning and delivery for patients with early-stage breast cancer as it may allow for more personalized radiotherapy.  Contrast-enhanced breast MRI has an established role in aiding in the detection, evaluation, and management of breast cancer. This article discusses MRI sequences, the clinical utility of MRI, and how MRI has been evaluated for use in breast radiotherapy treatment planning. We highlight the contribution of MRI in the decision-making regarding selecting appropriate candidates for breast conservation therapy and review the emerging role of MRI-guided breast radiotherapy.",11171236
"Bacterial pneumonia is an important and common diagnosis in small animals with respiratory disease. This review discusses the clinical presentation and diagnostic approach for dogs and cats suspected of having pneumonia. Bacterial pneumonia can present in both dogs and cats as either acute or chronic disease, and clinical signs may suggest respiratory or systemic impairment. Aspiration pneumonia, a common form of disease, can be caused by esophageal or laryngeal disease, vomiting, or altered mentation, such as with CNS disease or general anesthesia. Bacterial pneumonia can also develop due to inhaled airway foreign bodies, reduced local immune function, or impaired clearance of respiratory secretions. Rapid identification of the etiology and associated risk factors for pneumonia can help veterinarians develop a targeted therapeutic plan and prevent recurrence of disease.",11171252
"Endometrial cancer is a complex disease with multiple risk factors, distinct histological subtypes, and a variety of available therapeutic options. The disease’s pathogenesis involves several molecular mechanisms, such as genetic mutations, defects in the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) pathway, hormonal signaling pathway imbalances, epigenetic changes, and disturbances in angiogenesis. On the other hand, molecular biomarkers seem to have an essential role in the diagnosis, prognosis, prediction of therapeutic response, and monitoring of disease progression in endometrial cancer. This review highlights the most significant dysregulated molecular mechanisms and reveals the relationship between specific biomarkers and targeted therapy approaches in the fight against endometrial cancer. Endometrial cancer is one the most prevalent gynecological cancers and, unfortunately, has a poor prognosis due to low response rates to traditional treatments. However, the progress in molecular biology and understanding the genetic mechanisms involved in tumor processes offers valuable information that has led to the current classification that describes four molecular subtypes of endometrial cancer. This review focuses on the molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of endometrial cancers, such as genetic mutations, defects in the DNA mismatch repair pathway, epigenetic changes, or dysregulation in angiogenic or hormonal signaling pathways. The preclinical genomic and molecular investigations presented allowed for the identification of some molecules that could be used as biomarkers to diagnose, predict, and monitor the progression of endometrial cancer. Besides the therapies known in clinical practice, targeted therapy is described as a new cancer treatment that involves identifying specific molecular targets in tumor cells. By selectively inhibiting these targets, key signaling pathways involved in cancer progression can be disrupted while normal cells are protected. The connection between molecular biomarkers and targeted therapy is vital in the fight against cancer. Ongoing research and clinical trials are exploring the use of standard therapy agents in combination with other treatment strategies like immunotherapy and anti-angiogenesis therapy to improve outcomes and personalize treatment for patients with endometrial cancer. This approach has the potential to transform the management of cancer patients. In conclusion, enhancing molecular tools is essential for stratifying the risk and guiding surgery, adjuvant therapy, and cancer treatment for women with endometrial cancer. In addition, the information from this review may have an essential value in the personalized therapy approach for endometrial cancer to improve the patient’s life.",11171255
"Overall, this review offers a comprehensive and insightful exploration of the significance, implementation, and challenges of genomic newborn screening for pediatric cancer predisposition syndromes (CPSs). It emphasizes the importance of next-generation sequencing (NGS) in uncovering germline mutations that are responsible for CPSs in childhood malignancies. It delves into the selection criteria for screening, ethical considerations, gene panel selection, and the integration of established and emerging genes in CPS into large-scale newborn screening programs in healthcare systems. It also stresses the importance of early detection and its potential impact on pediatric care and outcomes, thus providing valuable information for healthcare professionals, researchers, and policymakers in the field of pediatric oncology and genetics. As next-generation sequencing (NGS) has become more widely used, germline and rare genetic variations responsible for inherited illnesses, including cancer predisposition syndromes (CPSs) that account for up to 10% of childhood malignancies, have been found. The CPSs are a group of germline genetic disorders that have been identified as risk factors for pediatric cancer development. Excluding a few “classic” CPSs, there is no agreement regarding when and how to conduct germline genetic diagnostic studies in children with cancer due to the constant evolution of knowledge in NGS technologies. Various clinical screening tools have been suggested to aid in the identification of individuals who are at greater risk, using diverse strategies and with varied outcomes. We present here an overview of the primary clinical and molecular characteristics of various CPSs and summarize the existing clinical genomics data on the prevalence of CPSs in pediatric cancer patients. Additionally, we discuss several ethical issues, challenges, limitations, cost-effectiveness, and integration of genomic newborn screening for CPSs into a healthcare system. Furthermore, we assess the effectiveness of commonly utilized decision-support tools in identifying patients who may benefit from genetic counseling and/or direct genetic testing. This investigation highlights a tailored and systematic approach utilizing medical newborn screening tools such as the genome sequencing of high-risk newborns for CPSs, which could be a practical and cost-effective strategy in pediatric cancer care.",11171256
"Although the prevalence of hybrid sterility in fish is a serious limitation to the quality development of the hybrid fish farming industry, it could be useful for the conservation of the genetic stock of endangered and valuable species. In this study, a total of 1709 DEGs were identified by performing RNA sequencing between hybrid and two pure yellow catfishes. A KEGG pathway analysis indicated that some genes related to reproductive functions were upregulated, including genes involved in the cell cycle and oocyte meiosis, whereas genes related to ECM–receptor interactions were downregulated. In total, 63 DEmiRNAs were obtained between the three species of yellow catfishes. The upregulated DEmiRNAs ipu-miR-194a and ipu-miR-499 were found to target the spermatogenesis-related genes CFAP70 and RSPH6A, respectively. Both acted as negative regulators, and this may underscore the miRNA–mRNA regulatory mechanism of sterility in hybrid yellow catfish (P. fulvidraco ♀ × P. vachelli ♂). The hybrid yellow catfish exhibits advantages over pure yellow catfish in terms of fast growth, fast development, a high feeding rate, and strong immunity; additionally, it is almost sterile, thus ensuring the conservation of the genetic stock of fish populations. To investigate the sterility mechanism in hybrid yellow catfish (P. fulvidraco (♀) × P. vachelli (♂)), the mRNA and miRNA of the gonads of P. fulvidraco, P. vachelli, and a hybrid yellow catfish were analyzed to characterize the differentially expressed genes; this was carried out to help establish gene expression datasets to assist in the further determination of the mechanisms of genetic sterility in hybrid yellow catfish. In total, 1709 DEGs were identified between the hybrid and two pure yellow catfishes. A KEGG pathway analysis indicated that several genes related to reproductive functions were upregulated, including those involved in the cell cycle, progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation, and oocyte meiosis, and genes associated with ECM–receptor interaction were downregulated. The spermatogenesis-related GO genes CFAP70, RSPH6A, and TSGA10 were identified as being downregulated DEGs in the hybrid yellow catfish. Sixty-three DEmiRNAs were identified between the hybrid and the two pure yellow catfish species. The upregulated DEmiRNAs ipu-miR-194a and ipu-miR-499 were found to target the spermatogenesis-related genes CFAP70 and RSPH6A, respectively, playing a negative regulatory role, which may underscore the miRNA–mRNA regulatory mechanism of sterility in hybrid yellow catfish. The differential expression of ipu-miR-196d, ipu-miR-125b, and ipu-miR-150 and their target genes spidr, cep85, and kcnn4, implicated in reproductive processes, was verified via qRT-PCR, consistent with the transcriptome sequencing expression trends. This study provides deep insights into the mechanism of hybrid sterility in vertebrate groups, thereby contributing to achieving a better understanding and management of fish conservation related to hybrid sterility.",11171309
"Alternative splicing is a mechanism that allows, through the combination of different exons, for the yielding of several protein variants from a single gene. These variants may display different and often opposed functions. Mutations occurring in driver genes result in oncogenesis, but alternative splicing may also result in obtaining oncogenic variants in the absence of driver mutations. This review describes how the oncogenic potential of driver genes is activated through aberrant alternative splicing. Firstly, there are driver genes directly acting on alternative splicing and their dysregulation affects the splicing of other genes involved in malignant transformation. A second possibility is that aberrant alternative splicing of a proto-oncogene or tumour suppressor gene results in the appearance of an oncogenic variant. The oncogenic potential of a total of 199 driver genes may result from aberrant alternative splicing, and the molecular mechanisms involved are detailed for more than 40 genes. Cancer driver genes are either oncogenes or tumour suppressor genes that are classically activated or inactivated, respectively, by driver mutations. Alternative splicing—which produces various mature mRNAs and, eventually, protein variants from a single gene—may also result in driving neoplastic transformation because of the different and often opposed functions of the variants of driver genes. The present review analyses the different alternative splicing events that result in driving neoplastic transformation, with an emphasis on their molecular mechanisms. To do this, we collected a list of 568 gene drivers of cancer and revised the literature to select those involved in the alternative splicing of other genes as well as those in which its pre-mRNA is subject to alternative splicing, with the result, in both cases, of producing an oncogenic isoform. Thirty-one genes fall into the first category, which includes splicing factors and components of the spliceosome and splicing regulators. In the second category, namely that comprising driver genes in which alternative splicing produces the oncogenic isoform, 168 genes were found. Then, we grouped them according to the molecular mechanisms responsible for alternative splicing yielding oncogenic isoforms, namely, mutations in cis splicing-determining elements, other causes involving non-mutated cis elements, changes in splicing factors, and epigenetic and chromatin-related changes. The data given in the present review substantiate the idea that aberrant splicing may regulate the activation of proto-oncogenes or inactivation of tumour suppressor genes and details on the mechanisms involved are given for more than 40 driver genes.",11171328
"This review discusses the enzymatic processes governing the initial stages of the synthesis of glycerophospholipids (phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylserine) and triacylglycerol. The key enzymes analyzed include glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferases (GPAT) and 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferases (AGPAT). Additionally, because most AGPATs have lysophospholipid acyltransferase (LPLAT) activity, enzymes involved in the Lands cycle with similar functions were also included. The review further explores the potential therapeutic implications of inhibiting these enzymes in the treatment of metabolic diseases and cancer. By elucidating the enzymatic pathways involved in lipid synthesis and their impact on various pathological conditions, the article contributes to the understanding of these processes and their potential as therapeutic targets. This review delves into the enzymatic processes governing the initial stages of glycerophospholipid (phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylserine) and triacylglycerol synthesis. The key enzymes under scrutiny include GPAT and AGPAT. Additionally, as most AGPATs exhibit LPLAT activity, enzymes participating in the Lands cycle with similar functions are also covered. The review begins by discussing the properties of these enzymes, emphasizing their specificity in enzymatic reactions, notably the incorporation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) such as arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) into phospholipids. The paper sheds light on the intricate involvement of these enzymes in various diseases, including obesity, insulin resistance, and cancer. To underscore the relevance of these enzymes in cancer processes, a bioinformatics analysis was conducted. The expression levels of the described enzymes were correlated with the overall survival of patients across 33 different types of cancer using the GEPIA portal. This review further explores the potential therapeutic implications of inhibiting these enzymes in the treatment of metabolic diseases and cancer. By elucidating the intricate enzymatic pathways involved in lipid synthesis and their impact on various pathological conditions, this paper contributes to a comprehensive understanding of these processes and their potential as therapeutic targets.",11171337
"Anti-cancer treatments often entail a spectrum of adverse effects, and among these, skin cancers have been under significant scrutiny. From traditional immunosuppressants such as methotrexate to chemotherapeutic agents such as fludarabine and hydroxyurea, as well as from new targeted therapies such as ibrutinib and JAK inhibitors to MAP kinase pathway inhibitors and sonic hedgehog pathway inhibitors, each treatment modality poses unique mechanisms of action and associated risks of skin cancer. In addition, the role of radiotherapy in inducing secondary skin cancers underscores the long-term consequences of therapeutic interventions. It is crucial to ascertain whether a specific therapy increases the risk of skin cancer so that appropriate screening measures can be implemented before and during treatment. Our comprehensive review not only investigates various medications and treatment modalities linked with heightened skin cancer risks, elucidating their mechanisms of action and relevant properties, but also proposes effective strategies for managing patients undergoing such therapies. Skin cancers involve a significant concern in cancer therapy due to their association with various treatment modalities. This comprehensive review explores the increased risk of skin cancers linked to different anti-cancer treatments, including classic immunosuppressants such as methotrexate (MTX), chemotherapeutic agents such as fludarabine and hydroxyurea (HU), targeted therapies like ibrutinib and Janus Kinase inhibitors (JAKi), mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (MAPKP) inhibitors, sonic hedgehog pathway (SHHP) inhibitors, and radiotherapy. MTX, a widely used immunosuppressant in different fields, is associated with basal cell carcinoma (BCC), cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), and cutaneous melanoma (CM), particularly at higher dosages. Fludarabine, HU, and other chemotherapeutic agents increase the risk of non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs), including cSCC and BCC. Targeted therapies like ibrutinib and JAKi have been linked to an elevated incidence of NMSCs and CM. MAPKP inhibitors, particularly BRAF inhibitors like vemurafenib, are associated with the development of cSCCs and second primary melanomas (SPMs). SHHP inhibitors like vismodegib have been linked to the emergence of cSCCs following treatment for BCC. Additionally, radiotherapy carries carcinogenic risks, especially for BCCs, with increased risks, especially with younger age at the moment of exposure. Understanding these risks and implementing appropriate screening is crucial for effectively managing patients undergoing anti-cancer therapies.",11171349
"Recent advances in cancer therapy have spotlighted immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) as a breakthrough in treating various cancers. These treatments, however, can lead to immune-related adverse events (irAEs) that mirror the body’s heightened immune response, affecting multiple organs. Recognizing and managing these irAEs is critical, and imaging modalities such as 18F-FDG PET/CT have emerged as a potential tool for early detection. This review delves into the capability of 18F-FDG PET/CT to identify irAEs, exploring the patterns of metabolic activation indicative of these events. While highlighting the current utility of PET/CT scans in oncology for tracking therapy response and irAEs, the review also speculates on future directions, suggesting a potential role in refining immunotherapy strategies and enhancing patient care. The insights obtained could transform patient monitoring during ICI therapy, potentially improving outcomes by facilitating prompt management of irAEs. Immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has revolutionized contemporary oncology, presenting efficacy in various solid tumors and lymphomas. However, ICIs may potentially overstimulate the immune system, leading to immune-related adverse events (irAEs). IrAEs may affect multiple organs, such as the colon, stomach, small intestine, kidneys, skin, lungs, joints, liver, lymph nodes, bone marrow, brain, heart, and endocrine glands (e.g., pancreas, thyroid, or adrenal glands), exhibiting autoimmune inflammation. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) is commonly used in oncology for staging and assessment of therapy responses, but it may also serve as a tool for detecting irAEs. This review aims to present various patterns of metabolic activation associated with irAEs due to ICI treatment, identifiable through 18F-FDG PET/CT. It describes the advantages of early detection of irAEs, but also presents the challenges in differentiating them from tumor progression. It also delves into aspects of molecular response assessment within the context of pseudoprogression and hyperprogression, along with typical imaging findings related to these phenomena. Lastly, it summarizes the role of functional PET imaging in oncological immunotherapy, speculating on its future significance and limitations.",11171385
"ARID1A mutations are emerging as a prognostic and predictive factor in gastric cancer. Recent studies suggest their potential role in predicting patient response to novel treatment strategies including immunotherapy, poly(ADP) ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors, and enhancer of zeste 2 polycomb repressive complex 2 subunit (EZH2) inhibitors. The aim of the present review is to provide a detailed appraisal of the significance of the loss of ARID1A functionality in GCs, and examine its prognostic and therapeutic implications. AT-rich interaction domain 1 (ARID1A) is a pivotal gene with a significant role in gastrointestinal tumors which encodes a protein referred to as BAF250a or SMARCF1, an integral component of the SWI/SNF (SWItch/sucrose non-fermentable) chromatin remodeling complex. This complex is instrumental in regulating gene expression by modifying the structure of chromatin to affect the accessibility of DNA. Mutations in ARID1A have been identified in various gastrointestinal cancers, including colorectal, gastric, and pancreatic cancers. These mutations have the potential to disrupt normal SWI/SNF complex function, resulting in aberrant gene expression and potentially contributing to the initiation and progression of these malignancies. ARID1A mutations are relatively common in gastric cancer, particularly in specific adenocarcinoma subtypes. Moreover, such mutations are more frequently observed in specific molecular subtypes, such as microsatellite stable (MSS) cancers and those with a diffuse histological subtype. Understanding the presence and implications of ARID1A mutations in GC is of paramount importance for tailoring personalized treatment strategies and assessing prognosis, particularly given their potential in predicting patient response to novel treatment strategies including immunotherapy, poly(ADP) ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors, and enhancer of zeste 2 polycomb repressive complex 2 subunit (EZH2) inhibitors.",11171396
"The Irish Association for Cancer Research (IACR) held its 59th annual conference from Wednesday, 22nd of February, to Friday, 24th February 2023, in Athlone, Ireland. The following article is a report of knowledge conveyed at the conference. The main themes of this conference explored key areas of basic, clinical, and translational research, which impact the diagnosis and treatment of cancer patients. The research presented at the conference emphasised the continuously changing paradigm within cancer research, with sessions covering a wide spectrum of topics from personalised prevention to personalised intervention, alongside emerging hallmarks, novel drug discoveries, and delivery systems. This was in conjunction with advancements in applications of artificial intelligence and data science within precision oncology that will ultimately revolutionise healthcare for cancer patients. Advancements in oncology, especially with the era of precision oncology, is resulting in a paradigm shift in cancer care. Indeed, innovative technologies, such as artificial intelligence, are paving the way towards enhanced diagnosis, prevention, and personalised treatments as well as novel drug discoveries. Despite excellent progress, the emergence of resistant cancers has curtailed both the pace and extent to which we can advance. By combining both their understanding of the fundamental biological mechanisms and technological advancements such as artificial intelligence and data science, cancer researchers are now beginning to address this. Together, this will revolutionise cancer care, by enhancing molecular interventions that may aid cancer prevention, inform clinical decision making, and accelerate the development of novel therapeutic drugs. Here, we will discuss the advances and approaches in both artificial intelligence and precision oncology, presented at the 59th Irish Association for Cancer Research annual conference.",11171401
"The early management of neonates with meconium ileus (MI) and cystic fibrosis (CF) is highly variable across countries and is not standardized. We conducted a systematic review according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses statement. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42024522838). Studies from three providers of academic search engines were checked for inclusion criteria, using the following search terms: meconium ileus AND cystic fibrosis OR mucoviscidosis. Regarding the patient population studied, the inclusion criteria were defined using our predefined PICOT framework: studies on neonates with simple or complicated meconium which were confirmed to have cystic fibrosis and were conservatively managed or surgically treated. Results: A total of 566 publications from the last 10 years were verified by the authors of this review to find the most recent and relevant data, and only 8 met the inclusion criteria. Prenatally diagnosed meconium pseudocysts, bowel dilation, and ascites on ultrasound are predictors of neonatal surgery and risk factor for negative 12-month clinical outcomes in MI-CF newborns. For simple MI, conservative treatment with hypertonic solutions enemas can be effective in more than 25% of cases. If repeated enemas fail to disimpact the bowels, the Bishop–Koop stoma is a safe option. No comprehensive research has been conducted so far to determine the ideal surgical protocol for complicated MI. We only found three studies that reported the types of stomas performed and another study comparing the outcomes of patients depending on the surgical management; the conclusions are contradictory especially since the number of cases analyzed in each study was small. Between 18% and 38% of patients with complicated MI will require reoperation for various complications and the mortality rate varies between 0% and 8%. Conclusion: This study reveals a lack of strong data to support management decisions, unequivocally shows that the care of infants with MI is not standardized, and suggests a great need for international collaborative studies.",11171516
"Transfer learning is a technique utilizing a pre-trained model’s knowledge in a new task. This helps reduce the sample size and time needed for training. These characteristics of transfer learning make it a perfect candidate to use in genetic research. The aim of our study is to review the current uses of transfer learning in genetic research. Here, we overview the use of transfer learning in the mutation detection of different cancers (lung, gastrointestinal, breast, glioma), gene expression, genetic syndrome detection (Down’s syndrome, Noonan syndrome, Williams–Beuren syndrome) based on the phenotype of patients, and identifying possible genotype–phenotype association. Using transfer learning in model development increases the final performance of the model compared with models trained from scratch. Artificial intelligence (AI), encompassing machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), has revolutionized medical research, facilitating advancements in drug discovery and cancer diagnosis. ML identifies patterns in data, while DL employs neural networks for intricate processing. Predictive modeling challenges, such as data labeling, are addressed by transfer learning (TL), leveraging pre-existing models for faster training. TL shows potential in genetic research, improving tasks like gene expression analysis, mutation detection, genetic syndrome recognition, and genotype–phenotype association. This review explores the role of TL in overcoming challenges in mutation detection, genetic syndrome detection, gene expression, or phenotype–genotype association. TL has shown effectiveness in various aspects of genetic research. TL enhances the accuracy and efficiency of mutation detection, aiding in the identification of genetic abnormalities. TL can improve the diagnostic accuracy of syndrome-related genetic patterns. Moreover, TL plays a crucial role in gene expression analysis in order to accurately predict gene expression levels and their interactions. Additionally, TL enhances phenotype–genotype association studies by leveraging pre-trained models. In conclusion, TL enhances AI efficiency by improving mutation prediction, gene expression analysis, and genetic syndrome detection. Future studies should focus on increasing domain similarities, expanding databases, and incorporating clinical data for better predictions.",11171544
"Ovarian cancer is the eighth most common cancer among women globally and 207,000 women die every year, whereas endometriosis affects around 10% of women of reproductive age. Endometriosis-associated ovarian cancers (EAOCs) frequently arise from ectopic endometrium (i.e., the presence of endometrial/stromal cells outside the uterine cavity) in the ovary. Over the past decades, there has been an increasing volume of evidence to suggest that signalling centred around the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) plays an important role in cellular functions such as proliferation, survival, and autophagy. This review summarizes the current landscape of mTOR signalling in these gynaecological malignancies and the emerging therapeutic options. Ovarian cancer is an umbrella term covering a number of distinct subtypes. Endometrioid and clear-cell ovarian carcinoma are endometriosis-associated ovarian cancers (EAOCs) frequently arising from ectopic endometrium in the ovary. The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a crucial regulator of cellular homeostasis and is dysregulated in both endometriosis and endometriosis-associated ovarian cancer, potentially favouring carcinogenesis across a spectrum from benign disease with cancer-like characteristics, through an atypical phase, to frank malignancy. In this review, we focus on mTOR dysregulation in endometriosis and EAOCs, investigating cancer driver gene mutations and their potential interaction with the mTOR pathway. Additionally, we explore the complex pathogenesis of transformation, considering environmental, hormonal, and epigenetic factors. We then discuss postmenopausal endometriosis pathogenesis and propensity for malignant transformation. Finally, we summarize the current advancements in mTOR-targeted therapeutics for endometriosis and EAOCs.",11172073
"In spontaneous tumor regression, tumors shrink and disappear without conventional treatments. This phenomenon challenges the view that cancer is an irreversible genetic disease and that the only treatment option is to kill cancer cells or surgically remove them. In tumor reversion, cancer cells have been shown to return to normal cells when they are transplanted into a normal cellular environment. Additionally, people consuming a Western diet ingest excessive amounts of dietary phosphate, and a dysregulated oversupply of phosphate can be transported into cells, stimulating the cellular growth that forms tumors. Based on reviewed evidence, this paper proposes that reducing excessive dietary phosphate potentially activates tumor regression and reversion, as components of cancer cells are self-digested. Furthermore, fevers and fasting-mimicking diets are associated with tumor regression, which also may be initiated by reduced phosphate intake. Studies are needed to test dietary phosphate reduction in tumor regression and reversion to improve cancer patient survival. Tumors that spontaneously shrink from unknown causes in tumor regression, and that return to normal cells in tumor reversion, are phenomena with the potential to contribute new knowledge and novel therapies for cancer patient survival. Tumorigenesis is associated with dysregulated phosphate metabolism and an increased transport of phosphate into tumor cells, potentially mediated by phosphate overload from excessive dietary phosphate intake, a significant problem in Western societies. This paper proposes that reduced dietary phosphate overload and reregulated phosphate metabolism may reverse an imbalance of kinases and phosphatases in cell signaling and cellular proliferation, thereby activating autophagy in tumor regression and reversion. Dietary phosphate can also be reduced by sickness-associated anorexia, fasting-mimicking diets, and other diets low in phosphate, all of which have been associated with tumor regression. Tumor reversion has also been demonstrated by transplanting cancer cells into a healthy microenvironment, plausibly associated with normal cellular phosphate concentrations. Evidence also suggests that the sequestration and containment of excessive phosphate within encapsulated tumors is protective in cancer patients, preventing the release of potentially lethal amounts of phosphate into the general circulation. Reducing dietary phosphate overload has the potential to provide a novel, safe, and effective reversion therapy for cancer patients, and further research is warranted.",11172109
"Our findings confirm the role of developmental aspects in extracranial germ cell tumors (eGCTs). Strong associations between syndromes or congenital anomalies and eGCTs may hint at the need for research to identify potential causes and mechanisms. Strong effects were observed for Swyer and Currarino syndrome. The strengths of the associations emphasize the need for further elaboration on presently discussed pathophysiological mechanisms. For other suggested risk factors such as Klinefelter, Turner, and Down syndrome, the strength of risk appears to be substantially low and may be missed because of diagnostic bias for the first two or lack of power for the latter. A number of further syndromes were identified in single cases. Most of these pertain to girls. GCTs are developmental tumors and are likely to reflect ontogenetic and teratogenetic determinants. The objective of this study was to identify syndromes with or without congenital anomalies and non-syndromic defects as potential risk factors. Patients with extracranial GCTs (eGCTs) registered in MAKEI 96/MAHO 98 between 1996 and 2017 were included. According to Teilum’s holistic concept, malignant and benign teratomas were registered. We used a case–control study design with Orphanet as a reference group for syndromic defects and the Mainz birth registry (EUROCAT) for congenital anomalies at birth. Co-occurring genetic syndromes and/or congenital anomalies were assessed accordingly. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated and p-values for Fisher’s exact test with Bonferroni correction if needed. A strong association was confirmed for Swyer (OR 338.6, 95% CI 43.7–2623.6) and Currarino syndrome (OR 34.2, 95% CI 13.2–88.6). We additionally found 16 isolated cases of eGCT with a wide range of syndromes. However, these were not found to be significantly associated following Bonferroni correction. Most of these cases pertained to girls. Regarding non-syndromic defects, no association with eGCTs could be identified. In our study, we confirmed a strong association for Swyer and Currarino syndromes with additional congenital anomalies.",11172205
"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic endocrine disorder that affects more than 20 million people in the United States. DM-related complications affect multiple organ systems and are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality among people with DM. Of the numerous acute and chronic complications, atherosclerosis due to diabetic dyslipidemia is a condition that can lead to many life-threatening diseases, such as stroke, coronary artery disease, and myocardial infarction. The nuclear erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling pathway is an emerging antioxidative pathway and a promising target for the treatment of DM and its complications. This review aims to explore the Nrf2 pathway’s role in combating diabetic dyslipidemia. We will explore risk factors for diabetic dyslipidemia at a cellular level and aim to elucidate how the Nrf2 pathway becomes a potential therapeutic target for DM-related atherosclerosis.",11172493
"Cancer encompasses various elements occurring at the cellular and genetic levels, necessitating an immunotherapy capable of efficiently addressing both aspects. T cells can combat cancer cells by specifically recognizing antigens on them. This innate capability of T cells has been used to develop cellular immunotherapies, but most of them can only target antigens through major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs). New gene-editing techniques such as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-associated protein 9 (CRISPR-cas9) can precisely edit the DNA sequences. CRISPR-cas9 has made it possible to generate genetically engineered chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) that can overcome the problems associated with old immunotherapies. In chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy, the patient’s T cells are isolated and genetically modified to exhibit synthetic CAR(s). CAR-T cell treatment has shown remarkably positive clinical outcomes in cancers of various types. Nevertheless, there are various challenges that reduce CAR-T effectiveness in solid tumors. It is required to address these challenges in order to make CAR-T cell therapy a better and safer option. Combining CAR-T treatment with other immunotherapies that target multiple antigens has shown positive outcomes. Moreover, recently generated Boolean logic-gated advanced CARs along with artificial intelligence has expanded its potential to treat solid tumors in addition to blood cancers. This review aims to describe the structure, types, and various methods used to develop CAR-T cells. The clinical applications of CAR-T cells in hematological malignancies and solid tumours have been described in detail. In addition, this discussion has addressed the limitations associated with CAR-T cells, explored potential strategies to mitigate CAR-T-related toxicities, and delved into future perspectives.",11172642
"Nitric oxide (NO) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) exert profound biological impacts dictated by their chemistry. Understanding their spatial distribution is essential for deciphering their roles in diverse biological processes. This review establishes a framework for the chemical biology of NO and RNS, exploring their dynamic reactions within the context of cancer. Concentration-dependent signaling reveals distinctive processes in cancer, with three levels of NO influencing oncogenic properties. In this context, NO plays a crucial role in cancer cell proliferation, metastasis, chemotherapy resistance, and immune suppression. Increased NOS2 expression correlates with poor survival across different tumors, including breast cancer. Additionally, NOS2 can crosstalk with the proinflammatory enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) to promote cancer progression. NOS2 and COX-2 co-expression establishes a positive feed-forward loop, driving immunosuppression and metastasis in estrogen receptor-negative (ER-) breast cancer. Spatial evaluation of NOS2 and COX-2 reveals orthogonal expression, suggesting the unique roles of these niches in the tumor microenvironment (TME). NOS2 and COX2 niche formation requires IFN-γ and cytokine-releasing cells. These niches contribute to poor clinical outcomes, emphasizing their role in cancer progression. Strategies to target these markers include direct inhibition, involving pan-inhibitors and selective inhibitors, as well as indirect approaches targeting their induction or downstream effectors. Compounds from cruciferous vegetables are potential candidates for NOS2 and COX-2 inhibition offering therapeutic applications. Thus, understanding the chemical biology of NO and RNS, their spatial distribution, and their implications in cancer progression provides valuable insights for developing targeted therapies and preventive strategies.",11173351
"Long noncoding RNAs play an important role in several pathogenic processes in diabetic nephropathy, but the relationship with epithelial-mesenchymal transition in DN is unclear. Herein, we found that KIFAP3-5:1 expression was significantly down-regulated in DN plasma samples, db/db mouse kidney tissues and high glucose treated renal tubular epithelial cells compared to normal healthy samples and untreated cells. Overexpression of KIFAP3-5:1 improved renal fibrosis in db/db mice and rescued epithelial-mesenchymal transition of high glucose cultured renal tubular epithelial cells. The silence of KIFAP3-5:1 will exacerbate the progression of EMT. Mechanistically, KIFAP3-5:1 was confirmed to directly target to the -488 to -609 element of the PRRX1 promoter and negatively modulate PRRX1 mRNA and protein expressions. Furthermore, rescue assays demonstrated that the knockdown of PRRX1 counteracted the KIFAP3-5:1 low expression-mediated effects on EMT in hRPTECs cultured under high glucose. The plasma KIFAP3-5:1 of DN patients is highly correlated with the severity of renal dysfunction and plays an important role in the prediction model of DN diseases. These findings suggested that KIFAP3-5:1 plays a critical role in regulation of renal EMT and fibrosis through suppress PRRX1, and highlight the clinical potential of KIFAP3-5:1 to assist in the diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy.

"Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (cALL) survivors suffer early-onset chronic diseases classically associated with aging. Normal aging is accompanied by organ dysfunctions, including immunological ones. We hypothesize that thymic immunosenescence occurs in cALL survivors and that its severity may correlate with early-onset chronic diseases. The PETALE study is a cALL survivor cohort with an extensive cardiovascular and metabolic evaluation. The thymic immunosenescence biomarker, signal joint T-cell receptor excision circles (TREC), was evaluated and was highly correlated with age in healthy participants (n = 281) and cALL survivors (n = 248). We observed a systematic thymic immunoage accentuation in each cALL survivor compared to controls ranging from 5.9 to 88.3 years. The immunoage gain was independent of age at diagnosis and treatment modalities and was more severe for females. Thymic aging was associated with several pathophysiological parameters, was greater in survivors suffering from metabolic syndrome, but there was no significant association with global physical condition. The decrease in TREC was independent from blood cell counts, which were normal, suggesting a segmental aging of the thymic compartment. Indeed, increased plasmatic T cell regulatory cytokines IL-6, IL-7 and GM-CSF accompanied high immunoage gain. Our data reveal that cALL or its treatment trigger a rapid immunoage gain followed by further gradual thymic immunosenescence, similar to normal aging. This leads to an enduring shift in accentuated immunoage compared to chronological age. Thus, accentuated thymic immunosenescence is a hallmark of cALL survivorship and TREC levels could be useful immunosenescence biomarkers to help monitoring the health of cancer survivors.",11176394
"CD24 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein that is expressed in a wide range of tissues and cell types. It is involved in a variety of physiological and pathological processes, including cell adhesion, migration, differentiation, and apoptosis. Additionally, CD24 has been studied extensively in the context of cancer, where it has been found to play a role in tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis. In recent years, there has been growing interest in CD24 as a potential therapeutic target for cancer treatment. This review summarizes the current knowledge of CD24, including its structure, function, and its role in cancer. Finally, we provide insights into potential clinical application of CD24 and discuss possible approaches for the development of targeted cancer therapies.",11176514
"Cross‐talk among biological pathways is essential for normal biological function and plays a significant role in cancer progression. Through integrated network analysis, this study explores the significance of pathway cross‐talk in colorectal cancer (CRC) development at both the pathway and gene levels. In this study, we integrated the gene expression data with domain knowledge to construct state‐dependent pathway cross‐talk networks. The significance of the genes involved in pathway cross‐talk was assessed by analyzing their association with cancer hallmarks, disease‐gene relation, genetic alterations, and survival analysis. We also analyzed the gene regulatory network to identify the dysregulated genes and their role in CRC progression. Cross‐talk was observed between immune‐related pathways and pathways associated with cell communication and signaling. The PTPRC gene was identified as a mediator, facilitating interactions within the immune system and other signaling pathways. The rewired interactions of ITGA7 were identified as influential in the epithelial‐mesenchymal transition in CRC. This study also highlighted the crucial link between cell communication and vascular smooth muscle contraction pathway in CRC progression. The survival analysis of identified gene clusters showed their significant prognostic value in distinguishing high‐risk from low‐risk CRC groups, and L1000CDS2 revealed seven potential drug molecules in CRC. Nine dysregulated genes (CTNNB1, EP300, JUN, MYC, NFKB1, RELA, SP1, STAT1, and TP53) emerge as transcription factors acting as common regulators across various pathways. This study highlights the crucial role of pathway cross‐talk in CRC progression and identified the potential prognostic biomarkers and potential drug molecules.",11176588
"Patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) 2 probably cannot tolerate chemotherapy or other antitumor therapies. Some studies have reported that immunotherapy combined with antiangiogenic therapy is well‐tolerated and shows good antitumor activity. However, the efficacy of this combination as a later‐line therapy in patients with ECOG PS 2 is unclear. This study evaluated the effectiveness and safety of this combination strategy as third‐ or further‐line therapy in stage IV non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with ECOG PS 2. In this retrospective study, patients treated with camrelizumab plus antiangiogenic therapy (bevacizumab, anlotinib, or recombinant human endostatin) were included. Objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), progression‐free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), quality of life (QOL) assessed by ECOG PS, and safety were analyzed. Between January 10, 2019, and February 28, 2024, a total of 59 patients were included. The ORR was 35.6% (21/59) and the DCR was 86.4%. With a median follow‐up of 10.5 months (range: 0.7–23.7), the median PFS was 5.5 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.8–7.3) and the median OS was 10.5 months (95% CI: 11.2–13.6). QOL was improved (≥1 reduction in ECOG PS) in 39 patients (66.1%). The most common Grade 3–4 treatment‐related adverse events were hepatic dysfunction (6 [10%]), hypertension (5 [8%]), and hypothyroidism (3 [5%]). There were no treatment‐related deaths. Third‐ or further‐line immunotherapy combined with antiangiogenic therapy is well‐tolerated and shows good antitumor activity in stage IV NSCLC patients with ECOG PS 2. Future large‐scale prospective studies are required to confirm the clinical benefits of this combination therapy.",11176590
"Control algorithms have been proposed based on knowledge related to nature-inspired mechanisms, including those based on the behavior of living beings. This paper presents a review focused on major breakthroughs carried out in the scope of applied control inspired by the gravitational attraction between bodies. A control approach focused on Artificial Potential Fields was identified, as well as four optimization metaheuristics: Gravitational Search Algorithm, Black-Hole algorithm, Multi-Verse Optimizer, and Galactic Swarm Optimization. A thorough analysis of ninety-one relevant papers was carried out to highlight their performance and to identify the gravitational and attraction foundations, as well as the universe laws supporting them. Included are their standard formulations, as well as their improved, modified, hybrid, cascade, fuzzy, chaotic and adaptive versions. Moreover, this review also deeply delves into the impact of universe-inspired algorithms on control problems of dynamic systems, providing an extensive list of control-related applications, and their inherent advantages and limitations. Strong evidence suggests that gravitation-inspired and black-hole dynamic-driven algorithms can outperform other well-known algorithms in control engineering, even though they have not been designed according to realistic astrophysical phenomena and formulated according to astrophysics laws. Even so, they support future research directions towards the development of high-sophisticated control laws inspired by Newtonian/Einsteinian physics, such that effective control-astrophysics bridges can be established and applied in a wide range of applications.",11176799
"The co‐occurrence of myasthenia gravis (MG) and lichen planus (LP) is a rare phenomenon, with only 13 cases reported in the English literature between 1971 and 2024. Patients with MG or LP, regardless of the thymoma status, require close monitoring for other autoimmune diseases. Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an uncommon autoimmune disease, resulting in fatigable muscle weakness in the ocular, bulbar, and respiratory muscles, as well as muscles of the extremities. Lichen planus (LP) is an autoimmune mucocutaneous disease, presenting with pruritic and violaceous plaques on the skin and mucosal surfaces. So far, MG and LP co‐occurrence is only reported in anecdotal individuals. This study reports a patient with MG and LP and systematically reviews the English literature on this rare co‐occurrence from 1971 to 2024, indicating only 13 cases with similar conditions. A 67‐year‐old man presented with ocular and progressive bulbar symptoms, a year after being diagnosed with generalized LP. Laboratory evaluations were normal except for the high anti‐AchR‐Ab titer and a positive ANA titer. Neurologic examinations revealed asymmetric bilateral ptosis, weakness and fatigability in proximal muscles, and a severe reduction in the gag reflex. He was diagnosed with late‐onset, seropositive MG. The treatment included pyridostigmine (60 mg, three times daily), intravenous immunoglobulin (25 g daily for 5 days), and oral prednisolone. There was no evidence of thymoma in the chest x‐ray and CT scan without contrast. However, a CT scan with contrast was not performed due to the patient's unstable condition. A common autoimmune mechanism may underlie the unclear pathophysiology of MG and LP co‐occurrence, with or without thymoma. Patients with MG, LP, or thymoma require close monitoring and assessment for other possible autoimmune diseases.",11177179
"MicroRNA-98 (miR-98) stands as an important molecule in the intricate landscape of oncology. As a subset of microRNAs, these small non-coding RNAs have accompanied a new era in cancer research, underpinning their significant roles in tumorigenesis, metastasis, and therapeutic interventions. This review provides a comprehensive insight into the biogenesis, molecular properties, and physiological undertakings of miR-98, highlighting its double-edged role in cancer progression—acting both as a tumor promoter and suppressor. Intriguingly, miR-98 has profound implications for various aspects of cancer progression, modulating key cellular functions, including proliferation, apoptosis, and the cell cycle. Given its expression patterns, the potential of miR-98 as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker, especially in liquid biopsies and tumor tissues, is explored, emphasizing the hurdles in translating these findings clinically. The review concludes by evaluating therapeutic avenues to modulate miR-98 expression, addressing the challenges in therapy resistance, and assessing the efficacy of miR-98 interventions. In conclusion, while miR-98’s involvement in cancer showcases promising diagnostic and therapeutic avenues, future research should pivot towards understanding its role in tumor-stroma interactions, immune modulation, and metabolic regulation, thereby unlocking novel strategies for cancer management.",11177407
"The role of estradiol (E2; an estrogen) in men needs to be more appreciated. In this review, we address the clinical situations that allow the study of the clinical consequences of E2 deficiency in men and discuss the effects of restoration of levels of this reproductive steroid hormone. In men with advanced prostate cancer (PCa) undergoing androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), E2 is suppressed along with testosterone, leading to side effects affecting the quality of life. These include hot flashes, arthralgia, fatigue, mood changes, cognition problems, weight gain, bone loss, and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Transdermal E2 alone for ADT has shown equivalent testosterone suppression compared to gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists while also preventing estrogen-deficiency side effects, including hot flashes and bone loss. Co-treatment of ADT with fetal estrogen estetrol (E4) has shown significant improvements of estrogen-deficiency symptoms. These observations emphasize the need to raise awareness of the importance of estrogens in men among clinicians and the lay public.",11177789
"Lenvatinib (LVN) is a potentially effective multiple-targeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved for treating hepatocellular carcinoma, metastatic renal cell carcinoma and thyroid cancer. Nonetheless, poor pharmacokinetic properties including poor water solubility and rapid metabolic, complex tumor microenvironment, and drug resistance have impeded its satisfactory therapeutic efficacy. This article comprehensively reviews the uses of nanotechnology in LVN to improve antitumor effects. With the characteristic of high modifiability and loading capacity of the nano-drug delivery system, an active targeting approach, controllable drug release, and biomimetic strategies have been devised to deliver LVN to target tumors in sequence, compensating for the lack of passive targeting. The existing applications and advances of LVN in improving therapeutic efficacy include improving longer-term efficiency, achieving higher efficiency, combination therapy, tracking and diagnosing application and reducing toxicity. Therefore, using multiple strategies combined with photothermal, photodynamic, and immunoregulatory therapies potentially overcomes multi-drug resistance, regulates unfavorable tumor microenvironment, and yields higher synergistic antitumor effects. In brief, the nano-LVN delivery system has brought light to the war against cancer while at the same time improving the antitumor effect. More intelligent and multifunctional nanoparticles should be investigated and further converted into clinical applications in the future.",11177867
"Duckweeds, including the common duckweed Lemna minor, are increasingly used to test eco‐evolutionary theories. Yet, despite its popularity and near‐global distribution, the understanding of its population structure (and genetic variation therein) is still limited. It is essential that this is resolved, because of the impact genetic diversity has on experimental responses and scientific understanding. Through whole‐genome sequencing, we assessed the genetic diversity and population genomic structure of 23 natural Lemna spp. populations from their natural range in Switzerland. We used two distinct analytical approaches, a reference‐free kmer approach and the classical reference‐based one. Two genetic clusters were identified across the described species distribution of L. minor, surprisingly corresponding to species‐level divisions. The first cluster contained the targeted L. minor individuals and the second contained individuals from a cryptic species: Lemna japonica. Within the L. minor cluster, we identified a well‐defined population structure with little intra‐population genetic diversity (i.e., within ponds) but high inter‐population diversity (i.e., between ponds). In L. japonica, the population structure was significantly weaker and genetic variation between a subset of populations was as low as within populations. This study revealed that L. japonica is more widespread than previously thought. Our findings signify that thorough genotype‐to‐phenotype analyses are needed in duckweed experimental ecology and evolution.",11178436
"Genomic alterations, such as missense mutations, often lead to the activation of oncogenic pathways and cell transformation by rewiring protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. Understanding how mutant-directed neomorph PPIs (neoPPIs) drive cancer is vital to developing new personalized clinical strategies. However, the experimental interrogation of neoPPI functions in patients with cancer is highly challenging. To address this challenge, we developed a computational platform, termed AVERON for discovering actionable vulnerabilities enabled by rewired oncogenic networks. AVERON enables rapid systematic profiling of the clinical significance of neomorph PPIs across different cancer types, informing molecular mechanisms of neoPPI-driven tumorigenesis, and revealing therapeutically actionable neoPPI-regulated genes. We demonstrated the application of the AVERON platform by evaluating the biological functions and clinical significance of 130 neomorph interactions, experimentally determined for oncogenic BRAFV600E. The AVERON application to broad sets of mutant-directed PPIs may inform new testable biological models and clinical strategies in cancer.",11179073
"Carnosine dipeptidase 1 (CNDP1), an enzyme integral to the hydrolysis of dipeptides containing histidine, plays an indispensable role in myriad physiological processes, including hydrolysis of proteins, maturation of specific biochemical functionalities within proteins, tissue regeneration, and regulation of cell cycle. However, the implications of CNDP1 in oncogenesis and its prognostic value are not yet fully elucidated. Initially, we procured the GSE40367 dataset from the Gene Expression Omnibus and established a protein–protein interaction network. Thereafter, we conducted functional and pathway enrichment analyses utilizing GO, KEGG, and GSEA. Moreover, we undertook an association analysis concerning the expression of CNDP1 with immune infiltration, along with survival analysis across various cancers and specifically in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Our study uncovered a total of 2,248 differentially expressed genes, with a down-regulation of CNDP1 in HCC and other cancers. Our explorations into the relationship between CNDP1 and immune infiltration disclosed a negative correlation between CNDP1 expression and the presence of immune cells in HCC. Survival analyses revealed that diminished expression of CNDP1 correlates with an adverse prognosis in HCC and several other types of cancer. These observations intimate that CNDP1 holds promise as a novel prognostic biomarker for both pan-cancer and HCC.",11179385
"Detection of structural variants (SVs) is currently biased toward those that alter copy number. The relative contribution of inversions toward genetic disease is unclear. In this study, we analyzed genome sequencing data for 33,924 families with rare disease from the 100,000 Genomes Project. From a database hosting >500 million SVs, we focused on 351 genes where haploinsufficiency is a confirmed disease mechanism and identified 47 ultra-rare rearrangements that included an inversion (24 bp to 36.4 Mb, 20/47 de novo). Validation utilized a number of orthogonal approaches, including retrospective exome analysis. RNA-seq data supported the respective diagnoses for six participants. Phenotypic blending was apparent in four probands. Diagnostic odysseys were a common theme (>50 years for one individual), and targeted analysis for the specific gene had already been performed for 30% of these individuals but with no findings. We provide formal confirmation of a European founder origin for an intragenic MSH2 inversion. For two individuals with complex SVs involving the MECP2 mutational hotspot, ambiguous SV structures were resolved using long-read sequencing, influencing clinical interpretation. A de novo inversion of HOXD11-13 was uncovered in a family with Kantaputra-type mesomelic dysplasia. Lastly, a complex translocation disrupting APC and involving nine rearranged segments confirmed a clinical diagnosis for three family members and resolved a conundrum for a sibling with a single polyp. Overall, inversions play a small but notable role in rare disease, likely explaining the etiology in around 1/750 families across heterogeneous clinical cohorts.",11179413
"We report the case of a patient who exhibits a concurrent diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus, Gitelman syndrome and Cacci-Ricci disease. A 27-year-old male patient was diagnosed with Gitelman syndrome at the age of 3 years. Fourteen years later, he developed an autoantibody-negative type 1 diabetes mellitus. Cacci-Ricci’s disease was revealed by terminal hematuria and considered in view of the appearance found on the computed tomography (CT) scan. The finger-prick blood glucose level was 6 g/dl with no acetonuria. Creatinine clearance was 60 ml/min. Thyroid function tests were normal. Calcium, phosphorus and parathormone (PTH) levels were normal. Discussion: Gitelman syndrome is a rare disorder. The association between Gitelman syndrome and type 1 diabetes mellitus has been reported in the literature in two patients. Authors have investigated the association between Gitelman syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Several pathophysiological explanations have been put forward. Cacci-ricci disease is a rare, benign congenital anomaly. No association between type 1 diabetes mellitus, Gitelman syndrome and Cacci-Ricci disease has been reported in the literature. To our knowledge, this is the first case described in the literature.",11179443
"The present study aimed to evaluate the frequencies of KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF mutations and their possible associations with clinicopathological features in 249 Moroccan patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). A retrospective investigation of a cohort of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues of 249 patients with CRC was screened for KRAS/NRAS/BRAF mutations using Idylla™ technology and pyrosequencing. KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF mutations were revealed in 46.6% (116/249), 5.6% (14/249), and 2.4% (6/249) of patients. KRAS exon 2 mutations were identified in 87.9% of patients (102/116). KRAS G12D and G12 C were the most frequent, at 32.8% and 12.93%, respectively. Among the patients with KRAS exon 2 wild-type (wt), 27.6% (32/116) harbored additional KRAS mutations. Concurrent KRAS mutations were identified in 9.5% (11/116); including six in codon 146 (A146P/T/V), three in codon 61 (Q61H/L/R), one in codon 12 (G12 A and Q61H), and one in codon 13 (G13D and Q61 L). Among the NRAS exon 2 wt patients, 64.3% (9/14) harbored additional NRAS mutations. Concurrent NRAS mutations were identified in 28.6% (4/14) of NRAS-mutant patients. Since 3.2% wt KRAS were identified with NRAS mutations, concomitant KRAS and NRAS mutations were identified in 2.4% (6/249) of patients. KRAS mutations were higher in the >50-year-old age-group (P = .031), and the tumor location was revealed to be significantly associated with KRAS mutations (P = .028) predominantly in left colon (27.5%) and colon (42.2%) locations. NRAS mutations were most prevalent in the left colon (42.8%) and in well-differentiated tumors (64.2%). Detection of KRAS mutations, particularly the G12 C subtype, may be significant for patients with CRC and has possible therapeutic implications. However, rare KRAS concomitant mutations in CRC patients suggest that each individual may present distinct therapeutic responses. KRAS testing alongside the identification of other affected genes in the same patient will make the treatments even more personalized by contributing more accurately to the clinical decision process. Overall, early diagnosis using novel molecular techniques may improve the management of CRC by providing the most efficient therapies for Moroccan patients.",11179507
"Over the past decade, the idea of targeting the endocannabinoid system to treat anxiety disorders has received increasing attention. Previous studies focused more on developing cannabinoid receptor agonists or supplementing exogenous cannabinoids, which are prone to various adverse effects due to their strong pharmacological activity and poor receptor selectivity, limiting their application in clinical research. Endocannabinoid hydrolase inhibitors are considered to be the most promising development strategies for the treatment of anxiety disorders. More recent efforts have emphasized that inhibition of two major endogenous cannabinoid hydrolases, monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) and fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), indirectly activates cannabinoid receptors by increasing endogenous cannabinoid levels in the synaptic gap, circumventing receptor desensitization resulting from direct enhancement of endogenous cannabinoid signaling. In this review, we comprehensively summarize the anxiolytic effects of MAGL and FAAH inhibitors and their potential pharmacological mechanisms, highlight reported novel inhibitors or natural products, and provide an outlook on future directions in this field.",11179644
"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a non-invasive therapy that has made significant progress in treating different diseases, including cancer, by utilizing new nanotechnology products such as graphene and its derivatives. Graphene-based materials have large surface area and photothermal effects thereby making them suitable candidates for PDT or photo-active drug carriers. The remarkable photophysical properties of graphene derivates facilitate the efficient generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon light irradiation, which destroys cancer cells. Surface functionalization of graphene and its materials can also enhance their biocompatibility and anticancer activity. The paper delves into the distinct roles played by graphene-based materials in PDT such as photosensitizers (PS) and drug carriers while at the same time considers how these materials could be used to circumvent cancer resistance. This will provide readers with an extensive discussion of various pathways contributing to PDT inefficiency. Consequently, this comprehensive review underscores the vital roles that graphene and its derivatives may play in emerging PDT strategies for cancer treatment and other medical purposes. With a better comprehension of the current state of research and the existing challenges, the integration of graphene-based materials in PDT holds great promise for developing targeted, effective, and personalized cancer treatments.",11179671
"TANGO2 deficiency disease (TDD) is a rare genetic disorder estimated to affect ∼8000 individuals worldwide. It causes neurodegeneration often accompanied by potentially lethal metabolic crises that are triggered by diet or illness. Recent work has demonstrated distinct lipid imbalances in multiple model systems either depleted for or devoid of the TANGO2 protein, including human cells, fruit flies and zebrafish. Importantly, vitamin B5 supplementation has been shown to rescue TANGO2 deficiency-associated defects in flies and human cells. The notion that vitamin B5 is needed for synthesis of the lipid precursor coenzyme A (CoA) corroborates the hypothesis that key aspects of TDD pathology may be caused by lipid imbalance. A natural history study of 73 individuals with TDD reported that either multivitamin or vitamin B complex supplementation prevented the metabolic crises, suggesting this as a potentially life-saving treatment. Although recently published work supports this notion, much remains unknown about TANGO2 function, the pathological mechanism of TDD and the possible downsides of sustained vitamin supplementation in children and young adults. In this Perspective, we discuss these recent findings and highlight areas for immediate scientific attention.",11179719
"Recent progress in human disease genetics is leading to rapid advances in understanding pathobiological mechanisms. However, the sheer number of risk-conveying genetic variants being identified demands in vivo model systems that are amenable to functional analyses at scale. Here we provide a practical guide for using the diploid frog species Xenopus tropicalis to study many genes and variants to uncover conserved mechanisms of pathobiology relevant to human disease. We discuss key considerations in modelling human genetic disorders: genetic architecture, conservation, phenotyping strategy and rigour, as well as more complex topics, such as penetrance, expressivity, sex differences and current challenges in the field. As the patient-driven gene discovery field expands significantly, the cost-effective, rapid and higher throughput nature of Xenopus make it an essential member of the model organism armamentarium for understanding gene function in development and in relation to disease.",11179720
"RASopathies are rare developmental genetic syndromes caused by germline pathogenic variants in genes that encode components of the RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal transduction pathway. Although the incidence of each RASopathy syndrome is rare, collectively, they represent one of the largest groups of multiple congenital anomaly syndromes and have severe developmental consequences. Here, we review our understanding of how RAS/MAPK dysregulation in RASopathies impacts skeletal muscle development and the importance of RAS/MAPK pathway regulation for embryonic myogenesis. We also discuss the complex interactions of this pathway with other intracellular signaling pathways in the regulation of skeletal muscle development and growth, and the opportunities that RASopathy animal models provide for exploring the use of pathway inhibitors, typically used for cancer treatment, to correct the unique skeletal myopathy caused by the dysregulation of this pathway.",11179721
"Mapping protein interaction complexes in their natural state in vivo is arguably the Holy Grail of protein network analysis. Detection of protein interaction stoichiometry has been an important technical challenge, as few studies have focused on this. This may, however, be solved by artificial intelligence (AI) and proteomics. Here, we describe the development of HaloTag-based affinity purification mass spectrometry (HaloMS), a high-throughput HaloMS assay for protein interaction discovery. The approach enables the rapid capture of newly expressed proteins, eliminating tedious conventional one-by-one assays. As a proof-of-principle, we used HaloMS to evaluate the protein complex interactions of 17 regulatory proteins in human adipocytes. The adipocyte interactome network was validated using an in vitro pull-down assay and AI-based prediction tools. Applying HaloMS to probe adipocyte differentiation facilitated the identification of previously unknown transcription factor (TF)–protein complexes, revealing proteome-wide human adipocyte TF networks and shedding light on how different pathways are integrated.",11180226
"Proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are heterobifunctional molecules that have the capability to induce specific protein degradation. While playing a revolutionary role in effectively degrading the protein of interest (POI), PROTACs encounter certain limitations that impede their clinical translation. These limitations encompass off-target effects, inadequate cell membrane permeability, and the hook effect. The advent of nanotechnology presents a promising avenue to surmount the challenges associated with conventional PROTACs. The utilization of nano-proteolysis targeting chimeras (nano-PROTACs) holds the potential to enhance specific tissue accumulation, augment membrane permeability, and enable controlled release. Consequently, this approach has the capacity to significantly enhance the controllable degradation of target proteins. Additionally, they enable a synergistic effect by combining with other therapeutic strategies. This review comprehensively summarizes the structural basis, advantages, and limitations of PROTACs. Furthermore, it highlights the latest advancements in nanosystems engineered for delivering PROTACs, as well as the development of nano-sized PROTACs employing nanocarriers as linkers. Moreover, it delves into the underlying principles of nanotechnology tailored specifically for PROTACs, alongside the current prospects of clinical research. In conclusion, the integration of nanotechnology into PROTACs harbors vast potential in enhancing the anti-tumor treatment response and expediting clinical translation.",11180470
"Determining egg quality is the foremost challenge in assisted reproductive technology (ART). Although extensive advances have been made in multiple areas of ART over the last 40 years, oocyte quality assessment tools have not much evolved beyond standard morphological observation. The oocyte not only delivers half of the nuclear genetic material and all of the mitochondrial DNA to an embryo but also provides complete developmental support during embryonic growth. Oocyte mitochondrial numbers far exceed those of any somatic cell, yet little work has been done to evaluate the mitochondrial bioenergetics of an oocyte. Current standard oocyte assessment in in vitro fertilization (IVF) centers include the observation of oocytes and their surrounding cell complex (cumulus cells) via stereomicroscope or inverted microscope, which is largely primitive. Additional oocyte assessments include polar body grading and polarized light meiotic spindle imaging. However, the evidence regarding the aforementioned methods of oocyte quality assessment and IVF outcomes is contradictory and non-reproducible. High-resolution microscopy techniques have also been implemented in animal and human models with promising outcomes. The current era of oocyte imaging continues to evolve with discoveries in artificial intelligence models of oocyte morphology selection albeit at a slow rate. In this review, the past, current, and future oocyte imaging techniques will be examined with the goal of drawing attention to the gap which limits our ability to assess oocytes in real time. The implications of improved oocyte imaging techniques on patients undergoing IVF will be discussed as well as the need to develop point of care oocyte assessment testing in IVF labs.",11180616
"In babies presenting with an omphalocele, other components of the prune belly syndrome should be scrutinized for early diagnosis and timely intervention. A male baby on his 13th day of life presented with an omphalocele. On evaluation, he had congenital absence of left kidney and bilateral cryptorchidism. Therefore, he was diagnosed with prune belly syndrome. He responded well to abdminoplasty, and wait and watch policy was applied for his cryptorchidism.",11183155
"For endemic benthos inhabiting hydrothermal vent fields, larval recruitment is critical for population maintenance and colonization via migration among separated sites. The vent‐endemic limpet, Lepetodrilus nux, is abundant at deep‐sea hydrothermal vents in the Okinawa Trough, a back‐arc basin in the northwestern Pacific; nonetheless, it is endangered due to deep‐sea mining. This species is associated with many other vent species and is an important successor in these vent ecosystems. However, limpet genetic diversity and connectivity among local populations have not yet been examined. We conducted a population genetics study of L. nux at five hydrothermal vent fields (maximum geographic distance, ~545 km; depths ~700 m to ~1650 m) using 14 polymorphic microsatellite loci previously developed. Genetic diversity has been maintained among these populations. Meanwhile, fine population genetic structure was detected between distant populations, even within this back‐arc basin, reflecting geographic distances between vent fields. There was a significant, positive correlation between genetic differentiation and geographic distance, but no correlation with depth. Contrary to dispersal patterns predicted by an ocean circulation model, genetic migration is not necessarily unidirectional, based on relative migration rates. While ocean circulation contributes to dispersal of L. nux among vent fields in the Okinawa Trough, genetic connectivity may be maintained by complex, bidirectional dispersal processes over multiple generations.",11183178
"Intestinal fibrosis is a prevalent complication of IBD that that can frequently be triggered by prolonged inflammation. Fibrosis in the gut can cause a number of issues, which continue as an ongoing challenge to healthcare systems worldwide. The primary causes of intestinal fibrosis are soluble molecules, G protein-coupled receptors, epithelial-to-mesenchymal or endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and the gut microbiota. Fresh perspectives coming from in vivo and in vitro experimental models demonstrate that fibrogenic pathways might be different, at least to some extent, independent of the ones that influence inflammation. Understanding the distinctive procedures of intestinal fibrogenesis should provide a realistic foundation for targeting and blocking specific fibrogenic pathways, estimating the risk of fibrotic consequences, detecting early fibrotic alterations, and eventually allowing therapy development. Here, we first summarize the inflammatory and non-inflammatory components of fibrosis, and then we elaborate on the underlying mechanism associated with multiple cytokines in fibrosis, providing the framework for future clinical practice. Following that, we discuss the relationship between modernization and disease, as well as the shortcomings of current studies. We outline fibrosis diagnosis and therapy, as well as our recommendations for the future treatment of intestinal fibrosis. We anticipate that the global review will provides a wealth of fresh knowledge and suggestions for future fibrosis clinical practice.",11184829
"Sporadic parathyroid adenoma (PA) is the most common cause of hyperparathyroidism, yet the mechanisms involved in its pathogenesis remain incompletely understood. Surgically removed PA samples, along with normal parathyroid gland (PG) tissues that were incidentally dissected during total thyroidectomy, were analysed using single‐cell RNA‐sequencing with the 10× Genomics Chromium Droplet platform and Cell Ranger software. Gene set variation analysis was conducted to characterise hallmark pathway gene signatures, and single‐cell regulatory network inference and clustering were utilised to analyse transcription factor regulons. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence were performed to validate cellular components of PA tissues. siRNA knockdown and gene overexpression, alongside quantitative polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting and cell proliferation assays, were conducted for functional investigations. There was a pervasive increase in gene transcription in PA cells (PACs) compared with PG cells. This is associated with high expression of histone‐lysine N‐methyltransferase 2A (KMT2A). High KMT2A levels potentially contribute to promoting PAC proliferation through upregulation of the proto‐oncogene CCND2, which is mediated by the transcription factors signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and GATA binding protein 3 (GATA3). PA tissues are heavily infiltrated with myeloid cells, while fibroblasts, endothelial cells and macrophages in PA tissues are commonly enriched with proinflammatory gene signatures relative to their counterparts in PG tissues. We revealed the previously underappreciated involvement of the KMT2A‒STAT3/GATA3‒CCND2 axis and chronic inflammation in the pathogenesis of PA. These findings underscore the therapeutic promise of KMT2A inhibition and anti‐inflammatory strategies, highlighting the need for future investigations to translate these molecular insights into practical applications. Single‐cell RNA‐sequencing reveals a transcriptome catalogue comparing sporadic parathyroid adenomas (PAs) with normal parathyroid glands.PA cells show a pervasive increase in gene expression linked to KMT2A upregulation.KMT2A‐mediated STAT3 and GATA3 upregulation is key to promoting PA cell proliferation via cyclin D2.PAs exhibit a proinflammatory microenvironment, suggesting a potential role of chronic inflammation in PA pathogenesis.

"The DNA‐dependent protein kinase (DNA‐PK), catalytic subunit, also known as DNA‐PKcs, is complexed with the heterodimer Ku70/Ku80 to form DNA‐PK holoenzyme, which is well recognized as initiator in the nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) repair after double strand break (DSB). During NHEJ, DNA‐PKcs is essential for both DNA end processing and end joining. Besides its classical function in DSB repair, DNA‐PKcs also shows multifaceted functions in various biological activities such as class switch recombination (CSR) and variable (V) diversity (D) joining (J) recombination in B/T lymphocytes development, innate immunity through cGAS–STING pathway, transcription, alternative splicing, and so on, which are dependent on its function in NHEJ or not. Moreover, DNA‐PKcs deficiency has been proven to be related with human diseases such as neurological pathogenesis, cancer, immunological disorder, and so on through different mechanisms. Therefore, it is imperative to summarize the latest findings about DNA‐PKcs and diseases for better targeting DNA‐PKcs, which have shown efficacy in cancer treatment in preclinical models. Here, we discuss the multifaceted roles of DNA‐PKcs in human diseases, meanwhile, we discuss the progresses of DNA‐PKcs inhibitors and their potential in clinical trials. The most updated review about DNA‐PKcs will hopefully provide insights and ideas to understand DNA‐PKcs associated diseases.",11185949
"Tumor immunotherapy has become an important adjuvant therapy after surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. In recent years, the role of tumor‐associated antigen (TAA) in tumor immunotherapy has become increasingly prominent. Cancer‐testis antigen (CTA) is a kind of TAA that is highly restricted in a variety of tumors and can induce an immune response. This review article aimed to evaluate the role of CTA on the progression of ovarian cancer, its diagnostic efficacy, and the potential for immunotherapy. We analyzed publications and outlined a comprehensive of overview the regulatory mechanism, immunogenicity, clinical expression significance, tumorigenesis, and application prospects of CTA in ovarian cancer, with a particular focus on recent progress in CTA‐based immunotherapy. The expression of CTA affects the occurrence, development, and prognosis of ovarian cancer and is closely related to tumor immunity. CTA can be used as a biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis evaluation of ovarian cancer and is an ideal target for antitumor immunotherapy. These findings provide novel insights on CTA in the improvement of diagnosis and treatment for ovarian cancer. The successes, current challenges and future prospects were also discussed to portray its significant potential.",11186301
"Cancer, a collection of more than two hundred different diseases, remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Usually detected at the advanced stages of disease, metastatic cancer accounts for 90% of cancer-associated deaths. Therefore, the early detection of cancer, combined with current therapies, would have a significant impact on survival and treatment of various cancer types. Epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation are some of the early events underlying carcinogenesis. Here, we report on an interpretable machine learning model that can classify 13 cancer types as well as non-cancer tissue samples using only DNA methylome data, with 98.2% accuracy. We utilize the features identified by this model to develop EMethylNET, a robust model consisting of an XGBoost model that provides information to a deep neural network that can generalize to independent data sets. We also demonstrate that the methylation-associated genomic loci detected by the classifier are associated with genes, pathways and networks involved in cancer, providing insights into the epigenomic regulation of carcinogenesis.",11186673
"Aurora kinase B (AURKB), an essential regulator in the process of mitosis, has been revealed through various studies to have a significant role in cancer development and progression. However, the specific mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study, therefore, seeks to elucidate the multifaceted role of AURKB in diverse cancer types. This study utilized bioinformatics techniques to examine the transcript, protein, promoter methylation and mutation levels of AURKB. The study further analysed associations between AURKB and factors such as prognosis, pathological stage, biological function, immune infiltration, tumour mutational burden (TMB) and microsatellite instability (MSI). In addition, immunohistochemical staining data of 50 cases of renal clear cell carcinoma and its adjacent normal tissues were collected to verify the difference in protein expression of AURKB in the two tissues. The results show that AURKB is highly expressed in most cancers, and the protein level of AURKB and the methylation level of its promoter vary among cancer types. Survival analysis showed that AURKB was associated with overall survival in 12 cancer types and progression‐free survival in 11 cancer types. Elevated levels of AURKB were detected in the advanced stages of 10 different cancers. AURKB has a potential impact on cancer progression through its effects on cell cycle regulation as well as inflammatory and immune‐related pathways. We observed a strong association between AURKB and immune cell infiltration, immunomodulatory factors, TMB and MSI. Importantly, we confirmed that the AURKB protein is highly expressed in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC). Our study reveals that AURKB may be a potential biomarker for pan‐cancer and KIRC.",11187167
"Parkinson disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases of the brain. Of note, brain renin‐angiotensin system (RAS) is intricate in the PD neuropathology through modulation of oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammation. Therefore, modulation of brain RAS by angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) may be effective in reducing the risk and PD neuropathology. It has been shown that all components including the peptides and enzymes of the RAS are present in the different brain areas. Brain RAS plays a critical role in the regulation of memory and cognitive function, and in the controlling of central blood pressure. However, exaggerated brain RAS is implicated in the pathogenesis of different neurodegenerative diseases including PD. Two well‐known pathways of brain RAS are recognized including; the classical pathway which is mainly mediated by AngII/AT1R has detrimental effects. Conversely, the non‐classical pathway which is mostly mediated by ACE2/Ang1‐7/MASR and AngII/AT2R has beneficial effects against PD neuropathology. Exaggerated brain RAS affects the viability of dopaminergic neurons. However, the fundamental mechanism of brain RAS in PD neuropathology was not fully elucidated. Consequently, the purpose of this review is to disclose the mechanistic role of RAS in in the pathogenesis of PD. In addition, we try to revise how the ACEIs and ARBs can be developed for therapeutics in PD.",11187740
"Gastric cancer (GC) remains a prominent malignancy that poses a significant threat to human well‐being worldwide. Despite advancements in chemotherapy and immunotherapy, which have effectively augmented patient survival rates, the mortality rate associated with GC remains distressingly high. This can be attributed to the elevated proliferation and invasive nature exhibited by GC. Our current understanding of the drivers behind GC cell proliferation remains limited. Hence, in order to reveal the molecular biological mechanism behind the swift advancement of GC, we employed single‐cell RNA‐sequencing (scRNA‐seq) to characterize the tumour microenvironment in this study. The scRNA‐seq data of 27 patients were acquired from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Differential gene analysis, Gene Ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis were employed to investigate 38 samples. The copy number variation level exhibited by GC cells was determined using InferCNV. The CytoTRACE, Monocle and Slingshot analysis were used to discern the cellular stemness and developmental trajectory of GC cells. The CellChat package was utilized for the analysis of intercellular communication crosstalk. Moreover, the findings of the data analysis were validated through cellular functional tests conducted on the AGS cell line and SGC‐7901 cell line. Finally, this study constructed a risk scoring model to evaluate the differences of different risk scores in clinical characteristics, immune infiltration, immune checkpoints, functional enrichment, tumour mutation burden and drug sensitivity. Within the microenvironment of GC, we identified the presence of 8 cell subsets, encompassing NK_T cells, B_Plasma cells, epithelial cells, myeloid cells, endothelial cells, mast cells, fibroblasts, pericytes. By delving deeper into the characterization of GC cells, we identified 6 specific tumour cell subtypes: C0 PSCA+ tumour cells, C1 CLDN7+ tumour cells, C2 UBE2C+ tumour cells, C3 MUC6+ tumour cells, C4 CHGA+ tumour cells and C5 MUC2+ tumour cells. Notably, the C2 UBE2C+ tumour cells demonstrated a close association with cell mitosis and the cell cycle, exhibiting robust proliferative capabilities. Our findings were fortified through enrichment analysis, pseudotime analysis and cell communication analysis. Meanwhile, knockdown of the transcription factor CREB3, which is highly active in UBE2C+ tumour cells, significantly impedes the proliferation, migration and invasion of GC cells. And the prognostic score model constructed with CREB3‐related genes showcased commendable clinical predictive capacity, thus providing valuable guidance for patients' prognosis and clinical treatment decisions. We have identified a highly proliferative cellular subgroup C2 UBE2C+ tumour cells in GC for the first time. The employment of a risk score model, which is based on genes associated with UBE2C expression, exhibits remarkable proficiency in predicting the prognosis of GC patients. In our investigation, we observed that the knockdown of the transcription factor CREB3 led to a marked reduction in cellular proliferation, migration and invasion in GC cell line models. Implementing a stratified treatment approach guided by this model represents a judicious and promising methodology.",11187953
"One significant complication of hepatitis B virus includes reactivation (HBVr) in the context of the use of immunosuppressive agents, such as corticosteroids and rituximab, among others. Limited data exist on the topic of HBVr risk in the context of tyrosine kinase inhibitors for which there is no strong guidance recommendation. We describe the clinical characteristics, diagnostic challenges, and the clinical course of a single patient with recurrent mantle cell lymphoma who developed HBVr after treatment with acalabrutinib, a Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor.",11188864
"There is evidence for a significant excess of kinetic upper limb tremor in non-FXTAS female FMR1 premutation carriers. The present study explores the possibility that this tremor is associated with various other features reminiscent of those occurring in syndromic FXTAS. This study analyzed the data from an Australian cohort of 48 asymptomatic premutation women. We utilized spiral drawings from CRST, representing action tremor; the CRST total tremor; and ICARS- kinetic tremors/cerebellar ataxia scales. Cognitive tests (involving executive functioning) included SDMT, TMT, two subtests of the WAIS-III: MR and Similarities. Spearman Rank correlations assessed the relationships between the above measures, and the Chi-square tested hypothesis about the association between the white matter hyperintensities (wmhs) in the splenium of corpus callosum assessed from MR images and spiral drawings scores. The spiral drawing scores were significantly correlated with all three non-verbal cognitive test scores, and with the CRST scores; the latter correlated with all four cognitive test measures. Similarities (verbal) scores correlated with CRST, ICARS, and with the remaining cognitive scores. Ordered spiral scores’ categories were significantly associated with the degree of splenium involvement. This study showed that, in non-FXTAS premutation female carriers, sub-symptomatic forms of kinetic tremor were associated with a broader motor, and cognitive (especially executive) dysfunction.",11188871
"Both immunotherapy (IO) and targeted therapy (TT) are used as adjuvant (adj) treatment for stage III melanoma, however, data describing real‐world outcomes are limited. In addition, a significant proportion of patients relapse, for whom best management is unclear. The aim of our study was to assess the efficacy, and safety of adj anti‐PD1 IO and TT in a real‐world cohort of patients with resected stage III melanoma, and further delineate patterns of recurrence and treatment strategies. We retrospectively analyzed 130 patients who received adj therapy (100 anti‐PD1 IO and 30 TT). At a median follow‐up of 30 months, median relapse‐free survival (RFS) was 24.6 (95% CI, 17–not reached [NR]) versus 64 (95% CI, 29.5–NR) months for the TT and IO groups, respectively (p = 0.26). Median overall survival (OS) was NR for either subgroup. At data cutoff, 77% and 82% of patients in TT and IO arms were alive. A higher number of grade ≥3 treatment‐related adverse events (AEs) were noted in the IO group (11% vs. 3%), however, a higher proportion of patients permanently discontinued adj therapy in the TT group (43% vs. 11%) due to toxicity. Strategies at relapse and outcomes were variable based on location and timing of recurrence. A significant number of patients who relapsed after adj IO received a second round of IO. Among them, patients who were off adj IO at relapse had superior second median RFS (mRFS2), compared to those who relapsed while on adj IO; mRFS2 was NR versus 5.1 months (95% CI, 2.5–NR), respectively, p = 0.02. In summary, both TT and IO yielded prolonged RFS in a real‐world setting, however, longer follow‐up is needed to determine any potential OS benefit. Adj therapy, particularly TT, may not be as well tolerated as suggested in clinical trials, with lower completion rates (59% vs. 74%) in a real‐life setting. Overall, patients who relapse during adj therapy have poor outcomes, while patients who relapse after discontinuation of adj IO therapy appear to benefit from IO re‐treatment.",11190025
"Kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) pathogenesis intricately involves immune system dynamics, particularly the role of T cells within the tumour microenvironment. Through a multifaceted approach encompassing single‐cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptome analysis and bulk transcriptome profiling, we systematically explored the contribution of infiltrating T cells to KIRC heterogeneity. Employing high‐density weighted gene co‐expression network analysis (hdWGCNA), module scoring and machine learning, we identified a distinct signature of infiltrating T cell‐associated genes (ITSGs). Spatial transcriptomic data were analysed using robust cell type decomposition (RCTD) to uncover spatial interactions. Further analyses included enrichment assessments, immune infiltration evaluations and drug susceptibility predictions. Experimental validation involved PCR experiments, CCK‐8 assays, plate cloning assays, wound‐healing assays and Transwell assays. Six subpopulations of infiltrating and proliferating T cells were identified in KIRC, with notable dynamics observed in mid‐ to late‐stage disease progression. Spatial analysis revealed significant correlations between T cells and epithelial cells across varying distances within the tumour microenvironment. The ITSG‐based prognostic model demonstrated robust predictive capabilities, implicating these genes in immune modulation and metabolic pathways and offering prognostic insights into drug sensitivity for 12 KIRC treatment agents. Experimental validation underscored the functional relevance of PPIB in KIRC cell proliferation, invasion and migration. Our study comprehensively characterizes infiltrating T‐cell heterogeneity in KIRC using single‐cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptome data. The stable prognostic model based on ITSGs unveils infiltrating T cells' prognostic potential, shedding light on the immune microenvironment and offering avenues for personalized treatment and immunotherapy.",11190954
"The inherent heterogeneity of cancer contributes to highly variable responses to any anticancer treatments. This underscores the need to first identify precise biomarkers through complex multi-omics datasets that are now available. Although much research has focused on this aspect, identifying biomarkers associated with distinct drug responders still remains a major challenge. Here, we develop MOMLIN, a multi-modal and -omics machine learning integration framework, to enhance drug-response prediction. MOMLIN jointly utilizes sparse correlation algorithms and class–specific feature selection algorithms, which identifies multi-modal and -omics–associated interpretable components. MOMLIN was applied to 147 patients’ breast cancer datasets (clinical, mutation, gene expression, tumor microenvironment cells and molecular pathways) to analyze drug-response class predictions for non-responders and variable responders. Notably, MOMLIN achieves an average AUC of 0.989, which is at least 10% greater when compared with current state-of-the-art (data integration analysis for biomarker discovery using latent components, multi-omics factor analysis, sparse canonical correlation analysis). Moreover, MOMLIN not only detects known individual biomarkers such as genes at mutation/expression level, most importantly, it correlates multi-modal and -omics network biomarkers for each response class. For example, an interaction between ER-negative-HMCN1-COL5A1 mutations-FBXO2-CSF3R expression-CD8 emerge as a multimodal biomarker for responders, potentially affecting antimicrobial peptides and FLT3 signaling pathways. In contrast, for resistance cases, a distinct combination of lymph node-TP53 mutation-PON3-ENSG00000261116 lncRNA expression-HLA-E-T-cell exclusions emerged as multimodal biomarkers, possibly impacting neurotransmitter release cycle pathway. MOMLIN, therefore, is expected advance precision medicine, such as to detect context–specific multi-omics network biomarkers and better predict drug-response classifications.",11190965
"Evaluation of quality of care in oncology is key in ensuring patients receive adequate treatment. American Society of Clinical Oncology’s (ASCO) Quality Oncology Practice Initiative (QOPI) Certification Program (QCP) is an international initiative that evaluates quality of care in outpatient oncology practices. We retrospectively reviewed free-text electronic medical records from patients with breast cancer (BR), colorectal cancer (CRC) or non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In a baseline measurement, high scores were obtained for the nine disease-specific measures of QCP Track (2021 version had 26 measures); thus, they were not further analysed. We evaluated two sets of measures: the remaining 17 QCP Track measures, as well as these plus other 17 measures selected by us (combined measures). Review of data from 58 patients (26 BR; 18 CRC; 14 NSCLC) seen in June 2021 revealed low overall quality scores (OQS)—below ASCO’s 75% threshold—for QCP Track measures (46%) and combined measures (58%). We developed a plan to improve OQS and monitored the impact of the intervention by abstracting data at subsequent time points. We evaluated potential causes for the low OQS and developed a plan to improve it over time by educating oncologists at our hospital on the importance of improving collection of measures and highlighting the goal of applying for QOPI certification. We conducted seven plan–do–study–act cycles and evaluated the scores at seven subsequent data abstraction time points from November 2021 to December 2022, reviewing 404 patients (199 BR; 114 CRC; 91 NSCLC). All measures were improved. Four months after the intervention, OQS surpassed the quality threshold and was maintained for 10 months until the end of the study (range, 78–87% for QCP Track measures; 78–86% for combined measures). We developed an easy-to-implement intervention that achieved a fast improvement in OQS, enabling our Medical Oncology Department to aim for QOPI certification.",11191778
"The incidence of perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PND) is high, especially after cardiac surgeries, and the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we conducted a prospective observational study to observe serum proteomics differences in PND patients after cardiac valve replacement surgery. Two hundred and twenty-six patients who underwent cardiac valve surgery were included. They were categorized based on scoring into non-PND group (group non-P) and PND group (group P’). The risk factors associated with PND were analyzed. These patients were further divided into group C and group P by propensity score matching (PSM) to investigate the serum proteome related to the PND by serum proteomics. The postoperative 6-week incidence of PND was 16.8%. Risk factors for PND include age, chronic illness, sufentanil dosage, and time of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Proteomics identified 31 down-regulated proteins and six up-regulated proteins. Finally, GSTO1, IDH1, CAT, and PFN1 were found to be associated with PND. The occurrence of PND can impact some oxidative stress proteins. This study provided data for future studies about PND to general anaesthesia and surgeries.",11192023
"Although ex situ collections of threatened plants are most useful when they contain maximal genetic variation, the conservation and maintenance of genetic diversity in collections are often poorly known. We present a case study using population genomic analyses of an ex situ collection of Karomia gigas, a critically endangered tropical tree from Tanzania. Only ~43 individuals are known in two wild populations, and ex situ collections containing 34 individuals were established in two sites from wild‐collected seed. The study aimed to understand how much diversity is represented in the collection, analyze the parentage of ex situ individuals, and identify efficient strategies to capture and maintain genetic diversity. We genotyped all known individuals using a 2b‐RADseq approach, compared genetic diversity in wild populations and ex situ collections, and conducted parentage analysis of the collections. Wild populations were found to have greater levels of genetic diversity than ex situ populations as measured by number of private alleles, number of polymorphic sites, observed and expected heterozygosity, nucleotide diversity, and allelic richness. In addition, only 32.6% of wild individuals are represented ex situ and many individuals were found to be the product of selfing by a single wild individual. Population genomic analyses provided important insights into the conservation of genetic diversity in K. gigas, identifying gaps and inefficiencies, but also highlighting strategies to conserve genetic diversity ex situ. Genomic analyses provide essential information to ensure that collections effectively conserve genetic diversity in threatened tropical trees.",11192163
