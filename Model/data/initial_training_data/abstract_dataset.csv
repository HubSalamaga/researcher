Abstract,ID
"Pollution is a critical concern of modern society for its heterogeneous effects on human health, despite a widespread lack of awareness. Environmental pollutants promote several pathologies through different molecular mechanisms. Pollutants can affect the immune system and related pathways, perturbing its regulation and triggering pro-inflammatory responses. The exposure to several pollutants also leads to alterations in gut microbiota with a decreasing abundance of beneficial microbes, such as short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria, and an overgrowth of pro-inflammatory species. The subsequent intestinal barrier dysfunction, together with oxidative stress and increased inflammatory responses, plays a role in the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal inflammatory diseases. Moreover, pollutants encourage the inflammation-dysplasia-carcinoma sequence through various mechanisms, such as oxidative stress, dysregulation of cellular signalling pathways, cell cycle impairment and genomic instability. In this narrative review, we will describe the interplay between pollutants, gut microbiota, and the immune system, focusing on their relationship with inflammatory bowel diseases and colorectal cancer. Understanding the biological mechanisms underlying the health-to-disease transition may allow the design of public health policies aimed at reducing the burden of disease related to pollutants.",11116734
"Androglobin (ADGB) is a highly conserved and recently identified member of the globin superfamily. Although previous studies revealed a link to ciliogenesis and an involvement in murine spermatogenesis, its physiological function remains mostly unknown. Apart from FOXJ1-dependent regulation, the transcriptional landscape of the ADGB gene remains unexplored. We, therefore, aimed to obtain further insights into regulatory mechanisms governing ADGB expression. To this end, changes in ADGB promoter activity were examined using luciferase reporter gene assays in the presence of a set of more than 475 different exogenous transcription factors. MYBL2 and PITX2 resulted in the most pronounced increase in ADGB promoter-dependent luciferase activity. Subsequent truncation strategies of the ADGB promoter fragment narrowed down the potential MYBL2 and PITX2 binding sites within the proximal ADGB promoter. Furthermore, MYBL2 binding sites on the ADGB promoter were further validated via a guide RNA-mediated interference strategy using reporter assays. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR experiments illustrated enrichment of the endogenous ADGB promoter region upon MYBL2 and PITX2 overexpression. Consistently, ectopic MYBL2 expression induced endogenous ADGB mRNA levels. Collectively, our data indicate that ADGB is strongly regulated at the transcriptional level and might have functions beyond ciliogenesis.",11119863
"Recurrent pregnancy Loss (RPL)is a frequent and upsetting condition. Besides the prevalent cause of RPL including chromosomal defects in the embryo,the effect of translational elements like alterations of epigenetics are of great importance. The emergence of epigenetics has offered a fresh outlook on the causes and treatment of RPL by focusing on the examination of DNA methylation. RPL may arise as a result of aberrant DNA methylation of imprinted genes, placenta-specific genes, immune-related genes, and sperm DNA, which may have a direct or indirect impact on embryo implantation, growth, and development. Moreover, the distinct immunological tolerogenic milieu established at the interface between the mother and fetus plays a crucial role in sustaining pregnancy. Given this, there has been a great deal of interest in the regulation of DNA methylation and alterations in the cellular components of the maternal-fetal immunological milieu. The research on DNA methylation's role in RPL incidence and the control of the mother-fetal immunological milieu is summed up in this review.",11127471
"This study examines the consistency between subjective similarity evaluations and the theoretical predictions derived from Tversky’s ratio model of similarity, alongside the impact of additional positive and negative features on perceived similarity to ideal and bad politicians. Using a sample of 120 participants, we assessed the similarity of eight candidate profiles to an ideal and bad politician, varying in positive and negative features. Participants’ subjective evaluations were compared with theoretical predictions derived from Tversky’s ratio model. The analysis focused on how candidate and referent valence influenced observed versus theoretical similarity. Subjective similarity judgments deviated systematically from theoretical predictions, especially for positively featured candidates, indicating a negativity effect. Additional positive features decreased the perceived similarity of favorable candidates to an ideal politician, while additional negative features did not significantly affect similarity judgments of unfavorable candidates. Our findings underscore a significant disparity between subjective and objective similarity judgments, notably for favorable candidates. While the ratio model performs well for unfavorable candidates, its applicability diminishes for favorable ones, emphasizing the role of feature valence in decision-making. Further research on feature valence is crucial for a comprehensive understanding across contexts.",11139025
"First Person is a series of interviews with the first authors of a selection of papers published in Disease Models & Mechanisms, helping researchers promote themselves alongside their papers. Fen van Rhijn-Brouwer is first author on ‘ Systematic review and meta-analysis of the effect of bone marrow-derived cell therapies on hind limb perfusion’, published in DMM. Fen is a PhD candidate in the lab of Marianne Verhaar at the University Medical Center Utrecht, The Netherlands, investigating how to use cell-based regenerative medicine strategies to treat vascular inflammation.",11139029
"Recent research has shown that membrane trafficking plays an important role in canonical Wnt signaling through sequestration of the β-catenin destruction complex inside multivesicular bodies (MVBs) and lysosomes. In this study, we introduce Ouabain, an inhibitor of the Na,K-ATPase pump that establishes electric potentials across membranes, as a potent inhibitor of Wnt signaling. We find that Na,K-ATPase levels are elevated in advanced colon carcinoma, that this enzyme is elevated in cancer cells with constitutively activated Wnt pathway and is activated by GSK3 inhibitors that increase macropinocytosis. Ouabain blocks macropinocytosis, which is an essential step in Wnt signaling, probably explaining the strong effects of Ouabain on this pathway. In Xenopus embryos, brief Ouabain treatment at the 32-cell stage, critical for the earliest Wnt signal in development-inhibited brains, could be reversed by treatment with Lithium chloride, a Wnt mimic. Inhibiting membrane trafficking may provide a way of targeting Wnt-driven cancers.",11139033
"Absence of dystrophin results in muscular weakness, chronic inflammation and cardiomyopathy in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Pharmacological corticosteroids are the DMD standard of care; however, they have harsh side effects and unclear molecular benefits. It is uncertain whether signaling by physiological corticosteroids and their receptors plays a modifying role in the natural etiology of DMD. Here, we knocked out the glucocorticoid receptor (GR, encoded by Nr3c1) specifically in myofibers and cardiomyocytes within wild-type and mdx52 mice to dissect its role in muscular dystrophy. Double-knockout mice showed significantly worse phenotypes than mdx52 littermate controls in measures of grip strength, hang time, inflammatory pathology and gene expression. In the heart, GR deletion acted additively with dystrophin loss to exacerbate cardiomyopathy, resulting in enlarged hearts, pathological gene expression and systolic dysfunction, consistent with imbalanced mineralocorticoid signaling. The results show that physiological GR functions provide a protective role during muscular dystrophy, directly contrasting its degenerative role in other disease states. These data provide new insights into corticosteroids in disease pathophysiology and establish a new model to investigate cell-autonomous roles of nuclear receptors and mechanisms of pharmacological corticosteroids.",11139035
"Preclinical and clinical studies on the administration of bone marrow-derived cells to restore perfusion show conflicting results. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on preclinical studies to assess the efficacy of bone marrow-derived cells in the hind limb ischemia model and identify possible determinants of therapeutic efficacy. In vivo animal studies were identified using a systematic search in PubMed and EMBASE on 10 January 2022. 85 studies were included for systematic review and meta-analysis. Study characteristics and outcome data on relative perfusion were extracted. The pooled mean difference was estimated using a random effects model. Risk of bias was assessed for all included studies. We found a significant increase in perfusion in the affected limb after administration of bone marrow-derived cells compared to that in the control groups. However, there was a high heterogeneity between studies, which could not be explained. There was a high degree of incomplete reporting across studies. We therefore conclude that the current quality of preclinical research is insufficient (low certainty level as per GRADE assessment) to identify specific factors that might improve human clinical trials.",11139036
"For a medication dispensing service to function with quality, continuous evaluation is required, which is why it is necessary to have reliable measurement tools that make it possible. Quality indicators can serve as tools for managing quality, as they are variables that directly or indirectly measure changes in a situation and help evaluate the progress made in addressing it. This article aims to determine the feasibility and reliability of a quality indicator system for a drug dispensing service for paediatric outpatients in two Mexican hospitals. A study of the development type of health systems and services at a microlevel was conducted from October 2020 to October 2021 in the pharmaceutical service of two Mexican hospitals. To determine the feasibility of the quality indicators, a retrospective evaluation was performed, which considered the indicators that could be calculated with the available information to be feasible. To determine reliability, an inter-observer agreement study (Kappa (κ)) was performed. The feasibility analysis revealed that all five reference indicators related to the structure were feasible in both hospitals. In the Infantil of the Californias hospital, all six process indicators evaluated were feasible, whilst only one was found feasible in H+ Querétaro. As for outcome indicators, only one was feasible in the Infantil of the Californias hospital. The causes of non-feasibility in both hospitals were the non-documentation of the primary data related to the stages of the process and the lack of instruments to measure patient satisfaction. The reliability of the indicators showed little variability. Although not all indicators were feasible, solutions were proposed so that the 15 reference indicators could be used if an organization decided to do so. The reliability of the indicators was demonstrated, evidencing the importance of the data sheet as a tool to generate valid reliable measures.

"There has been an increasing focus on deprescribing in psychiatry recently, particularly of antipsychotic medication, with recognition that not all patients with psychotic disorders require lifelong medication. We summarize some empirical and theoretical papers, and examine case studies to provide instruction on this topic. Recent studies have found that slower tapering (over months or longer) of antipsychotics is associated with a lower relapse rate than quicker tapering (weeks). Case studies presented suggest that the process of reduction is associated with the precipitation or exacerbation of psychotic symptoms and that a slower process of reduction may minimize this effect. This may be because faster reductions cause greater disruption of homeostatic equilibria, provoking psychotic symptoms either as direct withdrawal symptoms or consequences of nonpsychotic withdrawal symptoms (e.g. insomnia) – although not all patients will experience withdrawal symptoms. This suggests that smaller dose reductions, especially at lower doses, made very gradually, may minimize the risk of psychotic symptoms. Slower tapering of antipsychotics may provide time for adaptations made to the presence of the medications to resolve, thus reducing the disruption to homeostatic equilibrium caused by dose reduction, potentially reducing the risk of relapse. Exacerbation of psychotic symptoms on antipsychotic reduction may not represent evidence of the need for a higher dose of antipsychotic on a long-term basis but may indicate the need for more gradual reduction. Gradual reduction of antipsychotics, especially after long-term use in clinical practice is prudent.",11139239
"Digital interventions with artificial intelligence (AI) can potentially support people with asthma to reduce the risk of exacerbation. Engaging patients throughout the development process is essential to ensure usability of the intervention for the end-users. Using our Connected for Asthma (C4A) intervention as an exemplar, we explore how patient involvement can shape a digital intervention. Seven Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) colleagues from the Asthma UK Centre for Applied Research participated in four advisory workshops to discuss how they would prefer to use/interact with AI to support living with their asthma, the benefit and caveats to use the AI that incorporated asthma monitoring and indoor/outdoor environmental data. Discussion focussed on the three most wanted use cases identified in our previous studies. PPI colleagues wanted AI to support data collection, remind them about self-management tasks, teach them about asthma environmental triggers, identify risk, and empower them to confidently look after their asthma whilst emphasising that AI does not replace clinicians. The discussion informed the key components in the next C4A interventions, including the approach to interacting with AI, the technology features and the research topics. Attendees highlighted the importance of considering health inequities, the presentation of data, and concerns about data accuracy, data privacy, security and ownership. We have demonstrated how patient roles can shift from that of ‘user’ (the traditional ‘tester’ of a digital intervention), to a co-design partner who shapes the next iteration of the intervention. Technology innovators should seek practical and feasible strategies to involve PPI colleagues throughout the development cycle of a digital intervention; supporting researchers to explore the barriers, concerns, enablers and advantages of implementing digital healthcare.",11139256
"Motor Competence (MC) is related to the development of healthy lifestyles in children and adolescents, and many studies have compared it with different variables, including sports participation. This investigation aimed to characterize the components and total scores of MC regarding different physical activity practices, such as physical education (PE) classes, futsal, volleyball, and ballet, and to compare MC regarding sports, sex, and age-groups. Using a cross-sectional study, 398 Portuguese children and adolescents (398 participants: 200 boys and 198 girls; 12.649±3.46 years) were conveniently chosen between 2022 and 2023. Four groups of different sports were created: PE classes (n = 187), futsal (n = 80), volleyball (n = 101) and ballet (n = 30), and four different age groups: 7 to 9 years old (n = 117); 10 to 12 years old (n = 65), 13 to 15 years old (n = 96) and, 16 to 19 years old (n = 120). All participants reported to participate in at least two training sessions per week (1 hour each) for at least two years. MC was assessed with Motor Competence Assessment (MCA) comprising three components with six tests (two tests for each component). Participants’ total MC was calculated as the average of the three components of the MCA. Data were analyzed by applying ANOVA one-way with LSD post-hoc. Differences were found in MC among groups, where futsal participants showed better scores in general. Sex comparison showed that boys have a higher MC when practicing futsal, especially compared to volleyball players. Age-group analysis showed that younger participants had better MC levels compared to older ones. The whole group showed the 50th percentile of MC, but volleyball adolescents showed results below this reference. MC is intrinsically linked to an individual’s motor experiences and motivations rather than depending directly on the specific practice of the sport.",11139258
"Coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD) is a critical pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. Lower endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) phosphorylation leads to reduced endothelium-derived relaxing factor nitric oxide (NO) generation, causing and accelerating CMD. Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) has been shown to reduce NO production in umbilical vein endothelial cells. Oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) damages endothelial cell function. However, the relationship between ox-LDL and coronary microcirculation has yet to be assessed. Short-chain fatty acid (SCFA), a fermentation product of the gut microbiome, could improve endothelial-dependent vasodilation in human adipose arterioles, but the effect of SCFA on coronary microcirculation is unclear. In this study, we found ox-LDL stimulated expression of ER chaperone GRP78. Further, we activated downstream PERK/eIF2a, IRE1/JNK, and ATF6 signaling pathways, decreasing eNOS phosphorylation and NO production in human cardiac microvascular endothelial. Furthermore, SCFA-propionate can inhibit ox-LDL-induced eNOS phosphorylation reduction and raise NO production; the mechanism is related to the inhibition of ER stress and downstream signaling pathways PERK/eIF2a, IRE1/JNK, and ATF6. In summary, we demonstrate that ox-LDL induced CMD by activating ER stress, propionate can effectively counteract the adverse effects of ox-LDL and protect coronary microcirculation function via inhibiting ER stress.",11139260
"There is a growing population of adults aged 50 years or older living with HIV, facing unique challenges in care due to age, minority status, and stigma. Co-design methodologies, aligning with patient-centered care, have potential for informing interventions addressing the complex needs of older adults with HIV. Despite challenges, co-design has shown promise in empowering older individuals to actively participate in shaping their care experiences. The scoping review outlined here aims to identify gaps in existing co-design work with this population, emphasizing the importance of inclusivity based on PROGRESS-Plus characteristics for future patient-oriented research. This scoping review protocol is informed by the Joanna Briggs Institute Manual to explore co-design methods in geriatric HIV care literature. The methodology encompasses six stages: 1) developing research questions, 2) creating a search strategy, 3) screening and selecting evidence, 4) data extraction, 5) data analysis using content analysis, and 6) consultation with key stakeholders, including community partners and individuals with lived experience. The review will involve a comprehensive literature search, including peer-reviewed databases and gray literature, to identify relevant studies conducted in the past 20 years. The inclusive criteria focus on empirical data related to co-design methods in HIV care for individuals aged 50 or older, aiming to inform future research and co-design studies in geriatric HIV care. The study will be limited by the exclusion of papers not published or translated to English. Additionally, the varied terminology used to describe co-design across different research may result in the exclusion of articles using alternative terms. The consultation with key stakeholders will be crucial for translating insights into meaningful co-design solutions for virtual HIV care, aiming to provide a comprehensive synthesis that informs evidence-based strategies and addresses disparities in geriatric HIV care.",11139262
"Absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) is a crucial indicator of immunity in critical illness, but studies focusing on long-term outcomes in critically ill patients, particularly surgical patients, are still lacking. We sought to explore the association between week-one ALC and long-term mortality in critically ill surgical patients. We used the 2015–2020 critical care database of Taichung Veterans General Hospital (TCVGH), a referral hospital in central Taiwan, and the primary outcome was one-year all-cause mortality. We assessed the association between ALC and long-term mortality by measuring hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Furthermore, we used propensity score-matching and -weighting analyses, consisting of propensity score matching (PSM), inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW), and covariate balancing propensity score (CBPS), to validate the association. A total of 8052 patients were enrolled, with their one-year mortality being 24.2%. Cox regression showed that low ALC was independently associated with mortality (adjHR 1.140, 95% CI 1.091–1.192). Moreover, this association tended to be stronger among younger patients, patients with fewer comorbidities and lower severity. The association between low ALC and mortality in original, PSM, IPTW, and CBPS populations were 1.497 (95% CI 1.320–1.697), 1.391 (95% CI 1.169–1.654), 1.512 (95% CI 1.310–1.744), and 1.511 (95% CI 1.310–1.744), respectively. Additionally, the association appears to be consistent, using distinct cutoff levels to define the low ALC. We identified that early low ALC was associated with increased one-year mortality in critically ill surgical patients, and prospective studies are warranted to confirm the finding.",11139264
"After its emergence in China, the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has swept the world, leading to global health crises with millions of deaths. COVID-19 clinical manifestations differ in severity, ranging from mild symptoms to severe disease. Although perturbation of metabolism has been reported as a part of the host response to COVID-19 infection, scarce data exist that describe stage-specific changes in host metabolites during the infection and how this could stratify patients based on severity. Given this knowledge gap, we performed targeted metabolomics profiling and then used machine learning models and biostatistics to characterize the alteration patterns of 50 metabolites and 17 blood parameters measured in a cohort of 295 human subjects. They were categorized into healthy controls, non-severe, severe and critical groups with their outcomes. Subject’s demographic and clinical data were also used in the analyses to provide more robust predictive models. The non-severe and severe COVID-19 patients experienced the strongest changes in metabolite repertoire, whereas less intense changes occur during the critical phase. Panels of 15, 14, 2 and 2 key metabolites were identified as predictors for non-severe, severe, critical and dead patients, respectively. Specifically, arginine and malonyl methylmalonyl succinylcarnitine were significant biomarkers for the onset of COVID-19 infection and tauroursodeoxycholic acid were potential biomarkers for disease progression. Measuring blood parameters enhanced the predictive power of metabolic signatures during critical illness. Metabolomic signatures are distinctive for each stage of COVID-19 infection. This has great translation potential as it opens new therapeutic and diagnostic prospective based on key metabolites.",11139268
"The pathogenesis of anal sacculitis has not been extensively investigated, although atopic dogs seem to be predisposed to the disease. The aim of this study was therefore to characterize and compare the bacterial microbiota and pro-inflammatory cytokines in the anal sacs of dogs from three groups (healthy dogs, untreated atopic dogs and atopic dogs receiving antipruritic treatment or allergen-specific immunotherapy) in order to determine whether changes could be at the origin of anal sacculitis in atopic dogs. Bacterial populations of anal sac secretions from fifteen healthy dogs, fourteen untreated and six treated atopic dogs were characterized by sequencing the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene using Illumina technology. Proinflammatory cytokines were analyzed with the Luminex multiplex test. Community membership and structure were significantly different between the anal sacs of healthy and untreated atopic dogs (P = 0.002 and P = 0.003, respectively) and between those of untreated and treated atopic dogs (P = 0.012 and P = 0.017, respectively). However, the community structure was similar in healthy and treated atopic dogs (P = 0.332). Among the proinflammatory cytokines assessed, there was no significant difference between groups, except for interleukin 8 which was higher in the anal sacs of untreated atopic dogs compared to treated atopic dogs (P = 0.02), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha which was lower in the anal sacs of healthy dogs compared to treated atopic dogs (P = 0.04). These results reveal a dysbiosis in the anal sacs of atopic dogs, which may partially explain the predisposition of atopic dogs to develop bacterial anal sacculitis. Treatments received by atopic dogs (oclacitinib, desloratadine and allergen-specific immunotherapy) shift the microbiota of the anal sacs towards that of healthy dogs. Further studies are required to identify significant cytokines contributing to anal sacculitis in atopic dogs.",11139270
"The skin microbiome maintains healthy human skin, and disruption of the microbiome balance leads to inflammatory skin diseases such as folliculitis and atopic dermatitis. Staphylococcus aureus and Cutibacterium acnes are pathogenic bacteria that simultaneously inhabit the skin and cause inflammatory diseases of the skin through the activation of innate immune responses. Silkworms are useful invertebrate animal models for evaluating innate immune responses. In silkworms, phenoloxidase generates melanin as an indicator of innate immune activation upon the recognition of bacterial or fungal components. We hypothesized that S. aureus and C. acnes interact to increase the innate immunity-activating properties of S. aureus. In the present study, we showed that acidification is involved in the activation of silkworm hemolymph melanization by S. aureus. Autoclaved-killed S. aureus (S. aureus [AC]) alone does not greatly activate silkworm hemolymph melanization. On the other hand, applying S. aureus [AC] treated with C. acnes culture supernatant increased the silkworm hemolymph melanization. Adding C. acnes culture supernatant to the medium decreased the pH. S. aureus [AC] treated with propionic acid, acetic acid, or lactic acid induced higher silkworm hemolymph melanization activity than untreated S. aureus [AC]. S. aureus [AC] treated with hydrochloric acid also induced silkworm hemolymph melanization. The silkworm hemolymph melanization activity of S. aureus [AC] treated with hydrochloric acid was inhibited by protease treatment of S. aureus [AC]. These results suggest that acid treatment of S. aureus induces innate immune activation in silkworms and that S. aureus proteins are involved in the induction of innate immunity in silkworms.",11139275
"Depending on the degree of fracture, pelvic fracture can be accompanied by vascular damage, and in severe cases, it may progress to hemorrhagic shock. Pelvic radiography can quickly diagnose pelvic fractures, and the Association for Osteosynthesis Foundation and Orthopedic Trauma Association (AO/OTA) classification system is useful for evaluating pelvic fracture instability. This study aimed to develop a radiomics-based machine-learning algorithm to quickly diagnose fractures on pelvic X-ray and classify their instability. data used were pelvic anteroposterior radiographs of 990 adults over 18 years of age diagnosed with pelvic fractures, and 200 normal subjects. A total of 93 features were extracted based on radiomics:18 first-order, 24 GLCM, 16 GLRLM, 16 GLSZM, 5 NGTDM, and 14 GLDM features. To improve the performance of machine learning, the feature selection methods RFE, SFS, LASSO, and Ridge were used, and the machine learning models used LR, SVM, RF, XGB, MLP, KNN, and LGBM. Performance measurement was evaluated by area under the curve (AUC) by analyzing the receiver operating characteristic curve. The machine learning model was trained based on the selected features using four feature-selection methods. When the RFE feature selection method was used, the average AUC was higher than that of the other methods. Among them, the combination with the machine learning model SVM showed the best performance, with an average AUC of 0.75±0.06. By obtaining a feature-importance graph for the combination of RFE and SVM, it is possible to identify features with high importance. The AO/OTA classification of normal pelvic rings and pelvic fractures on pelvic AP radiographs using a radiomics-based machine learning model showed the highest AUC when using the SVM classification combination. Further research on the radiomic features of each part of the pelvic bone constituting the pelvic ring is needed.",11139281
"Urban development is not a process of even and planned progression on residential-industrial sites. Enclaves of high-standard space separate degraded and abandoned areas after industrial use has ended. The idea of the compact city is challenged by the need to search for niches for possible development and even to respond to crisis situations. Changing the approach to postmining sites located inside urban spaces generates an alternative to urban sprawl and the squandering of the stock of fertile suburban agricultural land. The aim of this article is to draw attention to the urban presence of postmining sites, to take a systemic view of ways to identify and describe their specific elements and to determine their impact, from the perspective of different user groups, on the quality of space. This research combined expert knowledge and the practical experience of users to create a model for a multilevel audit of postmining spaces. Knowledge about the postmining environment was transferred to landscape and urban design, creating a universal tool for developing strategies to increase the standard utilitarian functions of revitalized postmining areas. This tool will be useful at an early stage of urban development, management and planning.",11139283
"New vaccines, technologies, and regulations, alongside increased demand for vaccines, all require prioritization and coordination from key players within the vaccine sector. Inter-agency Coordinating Committees (ICC) support decision-making and coordination at the national-level and act as key drivers for sustainable improvements in vaccination programming. We utilized a previous qualitative case study, which investigated critical success factors for high routine immunization coverage in Zambia from 2000–2018, specifically to study the Zambian ICC. Qualitative data were collected between October 2019 and February 2020, including key informant interviews (n = 66) at the national, provincial, district, and health facility levels. Thematic analysis was applied to understand the role of the Zambian ICC and its impact on the policy environment over time. Within our study period, the ICC demonstrated the following improvements: 1) expanded membership to include diverse representation; 2) expanded scope and mandate to include maternal and child health in decision-making; and 3) distinct roles for collaboration with the Zambia Immunization Technical Advisory Group (ZITAG). The diverse and expansive membership of the Zambian ICC, along with its ability to foster government commitment and lobby for additional resources, supported improvements in immunization programming. The Zambian ICC holds considerable influence on government agencies and external partners, which facilitates procurement of funding, policy decisions, and strategic planning.",11139285
"Untargeted metabolomics investigations have characterized metabolic disturbances associated with various diseases in domestic cats. However, the pre-analytic stability of serum metabolites in the species is unknown. Our objective was to compare serum metabolomes from healthy cats stored at -20°C for up to 12 months to samples stored at -80°C. Serum samples from 8 adult, healthy cats were stored at -20°C for 6 months, -20°C for 12 months, or -80°C for 12 months. Untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to generate serum metabolite profiles containing relative abundances of 733 serum metabolites that were compared among storage conditions. Unsupervised analysis with principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering of Euclidian distances revealed separation of samples from individual cats regardless of storage condition. Linear mixed-effects models identified 75 metabolites that differed significantly among storage conditions. Intraclass correlation analysis (ICC) classified most serum metabolites as having excellent (ICC ≥ 0.9; 33%) or moderate (ICC 0.75–0.89; 33%) stability, whereas 13% had poor stability (ICC < 0.5). Biochemicals that varied significantly among storage conditions and classified with poor stability included glutathione metabolites, amino acids, gamma-glutamyl amino acids, and polyunsaturated fatty acids. The benzoate; glycine, serine and threonine; tryptophan; chemical (xenobiotics); acetylated peptide, and primary bile acid sub pathways were enriched among highly stable metabolites, whereas the monohydroxy fatty acid, polyunsaturated fatty, and monoacylglycerol sub-pathways were enriched among unstable metabolites. Our findings suggest that serum metabolome profiles are representative of the cat of origin, regardless of storage condition. However, changes in specific serum metabolites, especially glutathione, gamma-glutamyl amino acid, and fatty acid metabolites were consistent with increased sample oxidation during storage at -20°C compared with -80°C. By investigating the pre-analytic stability of serum metabolites, this investigation provides valuable insights that could aid other investigators in planning and interpreting studies of serum metabolomes in cats.",11139287
"Vaccination is crucial in reducing child mortality and the prevalence of Vaccine-Preventable-Diseases (VPD), especially in low-and-middle-income countries like Kenya. However, non-vaccination, under-vaccination, and missed opportunities for vaccination (MOV) pose significant challenges to these efforts. This study aimed to analyze the impact of demographic and socio-economic factors on non-vaccination, under-vaccination, and MOV among children aged 0–23 months in Kenya from 2003 to 2014. A secondary data analysis of data from the Kenya Demographic Health Surveys (KDHS) conducted during this period was conducted, with a total of 11,997 participants, using a two-stage, multi-stage, and stratified sampling technique. The study examined factors such as child’s sex, residence, mother’s age, marital status, religion, birth order, maternal education, wealth quintile, province, child’s birth order, parity, number of children in the household, place of delivery, and mother’s occupation. Binary logistic regression was employed to identify the determinants of non-vaccination, under-vaccination, and MOV, and multivariable logistic regression analysis to report odds ratios (OR) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). In 2003, the likelihood of non-vaccination decreased with higher maternal education levels: mothers who did not complete primary education (AOR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.37–0.81), completed primary education (AOR = 0.34, 95% CI = 0.21–0.56), and had secondary education or higher (AOR = 0.26, 95% CI = 0.14–0.50) exhibited decreasing probabilities. In 2008/09, divorced/separated/widowed mothers (AOR = 0.22, 95% CI = 0.07–0.65) and those with no religion (AOR = 0.37, 95% CI = 0.17–0.81) showed lower odds of non-vaccination, while lower wealth quintiles were associated with higher odds. In 2014, non-vaccination was higher among younger mothers aged 15–19 years (AOR = 12.53, 95% CI = 1.59–98.73), in North Eastern Province (AOR = 7.15, 95% CI = 2.02–25.30), in families with more than 5 children (AOR = 4.19, 95% CI = 1.09–16.18), and in children born at home (AOR = 4.47, 95% CI = 1.32–15.17). Similar patterns were observed for under-vaccination and MOV. This information can inform strategies for bridging the gaps in immunization coverage and promoting equitable vaccination practices in Kenya.",11139289
"In order to reveal the impact of pilot free trade zones policy on green development, we use multi-period difference-in-difference estimation and fixed effect model to explore the impact and impact mechanism of the establishment of free trade zones on the green transformation of enterprises from the micro perspective, based on the panel data of China’s A-share listed companies from 2009–2021, The results show that pilot free trade zones policy significantly improves the green transformation of enterprises in the zones. Pilot free trade zones policy affects the corporate green transformation through industrial agglomeration and financial constraints. The green transformation of state-owned enterprises, non-heavy polluting enterprises and high-tech enterprises are significantly impacted by pilot free trade zones policy. Urban innovation and green subsidies play a positive moderating role in the impact of free trade zones on enterprises’ green transformation. The research conclusions provide a valuable policy basis for how to promote the green transformation of enterprises under the free trade zones policy.",11139291
"There are many different types of scientific design thinking methods, but it is necessary to evaluate the applicability of the methods to the components of the design teaching curriculum in universities. Therefore, this study assesses the applicability of design thinking in terms of “design practice” and “locality” based on the local design education philosophy and the characteristics of the students and courses. A two-dimensional linguistic fuzzy model with two-tuples was proposed, and the assessment values of 36 experts were statistically analysed using the Delphi, triangular fuzzy number, Euclidean distance, two-dimension linguistic label (2DLL), and two-dimensional linguistic weighted arithmetic aggregation (2DLWAA) methods. The results highlighted the 12 categories of design thinking methods that are most applicable to teaching and learning, indicating the basic views of university design faculty on the application of design thinking methods. Finally, the new design teaching methods have been validated and constructed through years of teaching practice, and have some reference value for teaching design courses in universities.",11139305
"Internal displacement of populations due to armed conflicts can substantially impact a region’s Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) and the efforts towards the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The objective of this study was to determine the effects of conflict-driven Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) on vegetation cover and environmental sustainability in the Kas locality of Darfur, Sudan. Supervised classification and change analysis were performed on Sentinel-2 satellite images for the years 2016 and 2022 using QGIS software. The Sentinel-2 Level 2A data were analysed using the Random Forest (RF) Machine Learning (ML) classifier. Five land cover types were successfully classified (agricultural land, vegetation cover, built-up area, sand, and bareland) with overall accuracies of more than 86% and Kappa coefficients greater than 0.74. The results revealed a 35.33% (-10.20 km2) decline in vegetation cover area over the six-year study period, equivalent to an average annual loss rate of -5.89% (-1.70 km2) of vegetation cover. In contrast, agricultural land and built-up areas increased by 17.53% (98.12 km2) and 60.53% (5.29 km2) respectively between the two study years. The trends of the changes among different LULC classes suggest potential influences of human activities especially the IDPs, natural processes, and a combination of both in the study area. This study highlights the impacts of IDPs on natural resources and land cover patterns in a conflict-affected region. It also offers pertinent data that can support decision-makers in restoring the affected areas and preventing further environmental degradation for sustainability.",11139307
"Leptospirosis is a zoonosis caused by pathogenic species of bacteria belonging to the genus Leptospira. Most studies infer the epidemiological patterns of a single serogroup or aggregate all serogroups to estimate overall seropositivity, thus not exploring the risks of exposure to distinct serogroups. The present study aims to delineate the demographic, socioeconomic and environmental factors associated with seropositivity of Leptospira serogroup Icterohaemorraghiae and serogroup Cynopteri in an urban high transmission setting for leptospirosis in Brazil. We performed a cross-sectional serological study in five informal urban communities in the city of Salvador, Brazil. During the years 2018, 2020 2021, we recruited 2.808 residents and collected blood samples for serological analysis using microagglutination assays. We used a fixed-effect multinomial logistic regression model to identify risk factors associated with seropositivity for each serogroup. Seropositivity to Cynopteri increased with each year of age (OR 1.03; 95% CI 1.01–1.06) and was higher in those living in houses with unplastered walls (exposed brick) (OR 1.68; 95% CI 1.09–2.59) and where cats were present near the household (OR 2.00; 95% CI 1.03–3.88). Seropositivity to Icterohaemorrhagiae also increased with each year of age (OR 1.02; 95% CI 1.01–1.03) and was higher in males (OR 1.51; 95% CI 1.09–2.10), in those with work-related exposures (OR 1.71; 95% CI 1.10–2.66) or who had contact with sewage (OR 1.42; 95% CI 1.00–2.03). Spatial analysis showed differences in distribution of seropositivity to serogroups Icterohaemorrhagiae and Cynopteri within the five districts where study communities were situated. Our data suggest distinct epidemiological patterns associated with the Icterohaemorrhagiae and Cynopteri serogroups in the urban environment at high risk for leptospirosis and with differences in spatial niches. We emphasize the need for studies that accurately identify the different pathogenic serogroups that circulate and infect residents of low-income areas.",11139309
"The present study aimed to assess the use of technical-tactical variables and machine learning (ML) classifiers in the automatic classification of the passing difficulty (DP) level in soccer matches and to illustrate the use of the model with the best performance to distinguish the best passing players. We compared eight ML classifiers according to their accuracy performance in classifying passing events using 35 technical-tactical variables based on spatiotemporal data. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm achieved a balanced accuracy of 0.70 ± 0.04%, considering a multi-class classification. Next, we illustrate the use of the best-performing classifier in the assessment of players. In our study, 2,522 pass actions were classified by the SVM algorithm as low (53.9%), medium (23.6%), and high difficulty passes (22.5%). Furthermore, we used successful rates in low-DP, medium-DP, and high-DP as inputs for principal component analysis (PCA). The first principal component (PC1) showed a higher correlation with high-DP (0.80), followed by medium-DP (0.73), and low-DP accuracy (0.24). The PC1 scores were used to rank the best passing players. This information can be a very rich performance indication by ranking the best passing players and teams and can be applied in offensive sequences analysis and talent identification.",11139314
"The government of the Republic of Moldova, endorsed the principle of Health in All Policies (HiAP) through its health sector reforms to address the rising burden of non-communicable diseases and health inequalities. Territorial Public Health Councils (TPHCs) were created to ensure the coordination and management of the population’s health in their respective district. This study assessed the capacities of the TPHCs to identify areas in need of support for strengthening their intersectoral collaboration role in public health at local level. A mixed-method approach, using qualitative and quantitative techniques, was used to compare the perceptions of all TPHC members (n = 112) and invitees (n = 53) to council meetings from 10 districts covering all geographical areas of Moldova. The quantitative information was obtained using a cross-sectional survey, while the qualitative aspects were assessed within focus group discussions (FGDs). Half of all TPHC members, including 75% from groups with a non-medical background, did not attend a public health course within the last three years. Overall, groups with a medical background were more aware of the legislation that governs TPHC activity and intersectoral collaboration compared with those with a non-medical background. The FGDs of TPHC meetings revealed that members had an insufficient level of understanding of intersectoral collaboration to solve public health issues and lacked clarity about their place and role within the TPHC. HiAP implementation was found to be suboptimal with insufficient capacity at local level. TPHC members’ ability to deal with public health issues were severely impaired by a general lack of knowledge and understanding of how to utilize the TPHC platform for maximum benefit. Reforming TPHC regulation is required in addition to extensive capacity building for TPHC members to increase member understanding of their roles as intended by TPHC regulations, including the facilitation of intersectoral collaborations.",11139316
"Digital video incurs many distortions during processing, compression, storage, and transmission, which can reduce perceived video quality. Developing adaptive video transmission methods that provide increased bandwidth and reduced storage space while preserving visual quality requires quality metrics that accurately describe how people perceive distortion. A severe problem for developing new video quality metrics is the limited data on how the early human visual system simultaneously processes spatial and temporal information. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that the few data collected in the middle of the last century do not consider current display equipment and are subject to medical intervention during collection, which does not guarantee a proper description of the conditions under which media content is currently consumed. In this paper, the 27840 thresholds of the visibility of spatio-temporal sinusoidal variations necessary to determine the artefacts that a human perceives were measured by a new method using different spatial sizes and temporal modulation rates. A multidimensional model of human contrast sensitivity in modern conditions of video content presentation is proposed based on new large-scale data obtained during the experiment. We demonstrate that the presented visibility model has a distinct advantage in predicting subjective video quality by testing with video quality metrics and including our and other visibility models against three publicly available video datasets.",11139320
"A novel group of biocidal compounds are the Crystal 3D (Cry) and Cytolytic (Cyt) proteins produced by Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). Some Bt Cry proteins have a selective nematocidal activity, with Cry5B being the most studied. Cry5B kills nematode parasites by binding selectively to membrane glycosphingolipids, then forming pores in the cell membranes of the intestine leading to damage. Cry5B selectively targets multiple species of nematodes from different clades and has no effect against mammalian hosts. Levamisole is a cholinergic anthelmintic that acts by selectively opening L-subtype nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ion-channels (L-AChRs) that have been found on muscles of nematodes. A synergistic nematocidal interaction between levamisole and Cry5B at the whole-worm level has been described previously, but the location, mechanism and time-course of this synergism is not known. In this study we follow the timeline of the effects of levamisole and Cry5B on the Ca2+ levels in enterocyte cells in the intestine of Ascaris suum using fluorescence imaging. The peak Ca2+ responses to levamisole were observed after approximately 10 minutes while the peak responses to activated Cry5B were observed after approximately 80 minutes. When levamisole and Cry5B were applied simultaneously, we observed that the responses to Cry5B were bigger and occurred sooner than when it was applied by itself. It is proposed that the synergism is due to the cytoplasmic Ca2+ overload that is induced by the combination of levamisole opening Ca2+ permeable L-subtype nAChRs and the Ca2+ permeable Cry5B toxin pores produced in the enterocyte plasma membranes. The effect of levamisole potentiates and speeds the actions of Cry5B that gives rise to bigger Ca2+ overloads that accelerates cell-death of the enterocytes.",11139322
"Women living with HIV (WLWH) have high risk of developing cervical cancer. High- risk Human papillomavirus (hrHPV) is the single most important cause of cervical cancer. Vaccination for and early detection of pre-malignant cervical changes, through cervical cancer screening contributes to prevention of cervical cancer. This study sought to determine the prevalence of HPV among WLWH, genotypes present and the risk factors associated with cervical cancer development. An analytical cross-sectional study of 250 sexually active women aged 18 years and above, attending HIV clinic at a tertiary health facility in Accra. Demographic data collection and risk factor assessments were done using interviewer-administered questionnaire, and patient records. Cervical swabs were collected and tested for HPV using real-time PCR assays. Genotype analysis was performed on 92 samples. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression analysis were used to establish associations between hrHPV and risk factors among WLWH. Approximately 60% of study participants tested positive for HPV. The prevalence of hr-HPV among WLH was 44.4%. Factors identified to be protective of hrHPV were employment (AOR = 0.19, 95% CI = 0.06, 0.56, p = 0.003) and highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) Tenofovir-Lamivudine-Ritonavir-Lopinavir (TLRL) (AOR = 0.30, 95% CI = 0.09, 0.95, p = 0.04). Women with HIV diagnosis within 6 to10 years (AOR = 4.89, 95% CI = 1.05, 22.70, p = 0.043) and diagnosis >10 years (AOR = 8.25, 95% CI = 1.24, 54.84, p = 0.029) had higher odds of hrHPV. Approximately 25% of samples analysed tested positive for hr-HPV group 1 (genotypes 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45,51, 52, 56, 58, 69) and 46.8% for multiple HPV genotypes. A high prevalence of genotypes that include high risk genotypes 16 and 18 and multiple HPV infections was found among WLWH. Almost half of the women screened had high-risk HPV and were prone to cervical cancer without their knowledge. Regular HPV screening is recommended for high-risk patient groups.",11139324
"This research investigates the glass cliff effect and the positions held by women in leadership roles, focusing on their impact on operational liquidity. The study delves into the relationship between corporate governance attributes and operational liquidity in 60 non-financial companies listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange during Covid-19. Utilizing Quine-McCluskey technique and fuzzy set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA), it examines the combined effect of Women on the Board, Board Size, Ownership by Blockholders, Board Qualifications and Busy Directors on Operational Liquidity. The necessary condition analysis (NCA) emphasises that firms can operate without reliance on any particular variable taken in the study. The sufficiency analysis provided an expanded understanding of the three conditions leading to the same outcome both before and during the pandemic. This research highlights the significance of the glass cliff effect and emphasizes the pivotal role of women in effectively managing liquidity during times of crisis. Additionally, it provides valuable insights for policymakers regarding the impact of Covid-19 on the interplay between corporate governance characteristics and operational liquidity.",11139330
"Due to the health consequences arising from climate change, medical students will inevitably interact with affected patients during their training and careers. Accordingly, medical schools must incorporate education on the impacts of climate change on health and equity into their curricula. We created a curricular thread called “Climate Change, Health, and Equity” in the first-year preclinical medical program to teach foundational concepts and foster self-reflection and critical consciousness. The authors developed a continuum of practice including administrators, educators and faculty members, students, and community partners to plan and design curricular activities. First-year medical students at Duke University School of Medicine participated in seven mandatory foundational lectures and two experiential learning opportunities in the local community. Following completion of activities, students wrote a critical reflection essay and completed a self-directed learning exercise. Essays were evaluated using the REFLECT rubric to assess if students achieved critical reflection and for thematic analysis by Bloom’s Taxonomy. All students (118) submitted essays. A random sample of 30 (25%) essays underwent analysis. Evaluation by the REFLECT rubric underscored that all students were reflecting or critically reflecting on thread content. Thematic analysis highlighted that all students (30/30, 100%) were adept at identifying new areas of medical knowledge and connecting concepts to individual experiences, institutional practices, and public health and policy. Most students (27/30; 90%) used emotionally laden words, expressing negative feelings like frustration and fear but also positive sentiments of solidarity and hope regarding climate change and effects on health. Many students (24/30; 80%) expressed actionable items at every level including continuing self-directed learning and conversing with patients, minimizing healthcare waste, and advocating for climate-friendly policies. After participating in the curricular thread, most medical students reflected on cognitive, affective, and actionable aspects relating to climate change, health, and equity.",11139332
"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide, and oxidative stress plays a crucial role in its development. Juglone, a naturally occurring naphthoquinone in J. mandshurica, exhibits significant cytotoxic activity against various cancer cell lines. However, whether the anticancer activity of juglone is associated with oxidative stress remains unexplored. In this study, mouse Lewis lung cancer (LLC) and human non-small cell lung cancer A549 cells were used to explore the anticancer mechanisms of juglone. Juglone inhibited LLC and A549 cells viability, with IC50 values of 10.78 μM and 9.47 μM, respectively, for 24 h, and substantially suppressed the migration and invasion of these two lung cancer cells. Additionally, juglone arrested the cell cycle, induced apoptosis, increased the cleavage of caspase 3 and the protein expression of Bax and Cyt c, and decreased the protein expression of Bcl-2 and caspase-3. Furthermore, juglone treatment considerably increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, but suppressed glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities. It also inhibited the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway, which was attenuated by 1,3-diCQA (an activator of PI3K/Akt). Moreover, N-acetylcysteine (a ROS scavenger) partially reversed the positive effects of juglone in terms of migration, invasion, ROS production, apoptosis, and PI3K/Akt pathway-associated protein expression. Finally, in tumor-bearing nude mouse models, juglone inhibited tumor growth without any apparent toxicity and significantly induced apoptosis in NSCLC cells. Collectively, our findings suggest that juglone triggers apoptosis via the ROS-mediated PI3K/Akt pathway. Therefore, juglone may serve as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of NSCLC.",11139338
"Glioblastoma, the most aggressive and prevalent form of primary brain tumor, is characterized by rapid growth, diffuse infiltration, and resistance to therapies. Intrinsic heterogeneity and cellular plasticity contribute to its rapid progression under therapy; therefore, there is a need to fully understand these tumors at a single-cell level. Over the past decade, single-cell transcriptomics has enabled the molecular characterization of individual cells within glioblastomas, providing previously unattainable insights into the genetic and molecular features that drive tumorigenesis, disease progression, and therapy resistance. However, despite advances in single-cell technologies, challenges such as high costs, complex data analysis and interpretation, and difficulties in translating findings into clinical practice persist. As single-cell technologies are developed further, more insights into the cellular and molecular heterogeneity of glioblastomas are expected, which will help guide the development of personalized and effective therapies, thereby improving prognosis and quality of life for patients.",11139343
"In this paper, we examine q-Bernstein-Bézier surfaces in Minkowski space-R13 with q as the shape parameter. These surfaces, a generalization of Bézier surfaces, have applications in mathematics, computer-aided geometric design, and computer graphics for the surface formation and modeling. We analyze the timelike and spacelike cases of q-Bernstein-Bézier surfaces using known boundary control points. The mean curvature and Gaussian curvature of these q-Bernstein-Bézier surfaces are computed by finding the respective fundamental coefficients. We also investigate the shape operator dependency for timelike and spacelike q-Bernstein-Bézier surfaces in Minkowski space-R13, and provide biquadratic and bicubic q-Bernstein-Bézier surfaces as illustrative examples for different values of the shape controlling parameter q.",11139346
"This study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of remogliflozin compared to vildagliptin as an add-on drug to metformin in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) treatment. Metformin is considered a first-line drug in T2DM. However, as the disease progresses with heightened insulin resistance and declining β-cell function, the use of metformin alone is often inadequate to achieve optimum glucose levels. This prospective, randomised study was conducted at Maulana Azad Medical College and Associated Hospital in New Delhi, India, between February 2020 to January 2021. This study recruited 60 T2DM patients aged 35–70 years with glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) >6.5% taking metformin at a daily dosage of 1,500–3,000 mg for ≥3 months. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either vildagliptin (50 mg) or remogliflozin (100 mg) twice daily for 90 days. The primary endpoint was a change in HbA1c levels from baseline to the end of 90 days whereas secondary endpoints were changes in lipid profile and weight. The decrement in mean HbA1c levels was significantly higher in the remogliflozin group than in the vildagliptin group (−8.1% versus −2.4%; P <0.001). In addition, more significant weight loss was found in remogliflozin-treated patients (−5.2% versus −0.6%; P <0.01). Both treatments were well tolerated throughout the study. Compared to vildagliptin, remoglilflozin was significantly more effective in glycaemic control and weight loss in patients with T2DM and can therefore be considered as an add-on drug in T2DM not adequately controlled by metformin monotherapy.",11139359
"Peri-ictal water drinking (PIWD) is a rare vegetative manifestation of temporal lobe epilepsy without a definite lateralisation value. We report a case of PIWD in a 22-year-old Omani male patient with post-concussion syndrome and epilepsy presented to a tertiary care hospital in Muscat, Oman, in 2021 for evaluation of paroxysmal events. His behaviour of PIWD was misinterpreted by his family until characterised in the epilepsy-monitoring unit as a manifestation of epilepsy that was treated medically. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the second reported case in the region.",11139365
"This study aimed to determine the rate and severity patterns of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and identify antenatal and postnatal factors associated with BPD in preterm infants <32 weeks of gestational age (GA). This retrospective observational study included preterm neonates <32 weeks of gestation admitted into the neonatal intensive care unit between January 2010 and December 2017 at Sultan Qaboos University Hospital, Muscat, Oman. A data set of antenatal and perinatal factors were collected. BPD was defined as the need for oxygen and/or respiratory support at 36 weeks post-menstrual age (PMA). Infants with and without BPD were compared in their antenatal and perinatal factors. A total of 589 preterm infants <32 weeks were admitted. Among them, 505 (85.7%) survived to 36 weeks’ PMA and 90 (17.8%) had BPD. The combined BPD and mortality rate was 28.4%. Grades 1, 2 and 3 BPD constituted 77.8%, 7.8% and 14.4%, respectively. BPD was associated with lower GA, lower birth weight, need for intubation at resuscitation, lower Apgar scores, longer duration of ventilation, surfactant therapy and higher rates of neonatal morbidities. On binary logistic regression analysis, predictors of BPD were longer duration of ventilation, intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) and necrotising enterocolitis (NEC). In an Omani centre, 17.8% of preterm infants (<32 weeks GA) developed BPD. Various perinatal and neonatal factors were associated with BPD. However, longer duration of ventilation, IVH grades 1 and 2 and NEC stages II and III were significant predictors. Future multicentre research is necessary to provide the overall prevalence of BPD in Oman to help optimise the resources for BPD prevention and management in preterm infants.",11139367
"This study aimed to evaluate the outcomes of laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair (LIHR) regarding postoperative pain, recurrence rates, duration of hospital stay and other postoperative outcomes within the context of a tertiary care teaching hospital in South India, and the initial experience of laparoscopic repairs. The current consensus in the literature often suggests LIHR as superior to open inguinal hernia repair (OIHR). This single-centre, retrospective, observational study was conducted at the Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Education and Research, Puducherry, India, from January 2011 to September 2020. All patients who underwent elective OIHR and LIHR were included. Data on the patients demographics, comorbidities, hernia type, mesh characteristics, surgery duration, hospital stay and immediate postoperative complications were collected and analysed. A total of 2,690 OIHR and 158 LIHR cases were identified. The demographic profiles, hospital stay and complication rates were similar in both groups. However, surgical site infection was present exclusively in the OIHR group (3.55% versus 0.0%; P <0.05). The timeline for returning to normal activities was statistically shorter for the LIHR group (6 versus 8 days; P <0.05). The most frequent immediate complication in the LIHR group was subcutaneous emphysema (6.54% versus 0.0%; P <0.05). Recurrence (9.23% versus 3.61%; P = 0.09) and chronic pain (41.53% versus 13.55%; P <0.05) were higher in the LIHR group. Lower recurrence and chronic pain rates were observed with OIHR in the initial experience with LIHR in the hospital. However, LIHR had significant advantages concerning faster patient recovery and lower rates of surgical site infections. While the results contribute an interesting deviation from the standard narrative, they should be interpreted within the context of a learning curve associated with the early experience of the research team with LIHR.",11139377

"Delay in care secondary to socioeconomic status (SES) and demographic factors represents an area for potential improvement. Reducing time to surgery in distal radius fracture (DRF) fixation may improve outcomes while reducing cost. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of SES on time to surgery in our study population. Patients undergoing outpatient DRF surgery within an academic healthcare system during a 4-year period were reviewed. Time to surgery and demographic factors were analyzed. The US Census Bureau was used to determine median household income (MHI) for a patient’s ZIP code; patients were stratified into three groups based on MHI. A total of 413 patients met inclusion criteria. SES (14.7 d in the low-SES group, 14.0 d in the mid-SES group, and 11.1 d in the high-SES group, P = 0.00063), insurance (11.7 d for insured versus 16.3 d for Medicaid/uninsured, P < 0.0001), race (non-White group: 15.2 d versus White group: 10.9 d, P < 0.0001), and treatment facility (16.2 d at county hospital versus 10.9 d at university hospital, P < 0.0001) were associated with time to surgery in univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis found that only treatment facility was associated with time to surgery. Non-White, uninsured/Medicaid individuals residing in low-SES areas may be more likely to receive care at a safety-net facility and are at greatest risk for delay in time to surgery. Measures aimed to reduce barriers to care, increase healthcare coverage, and improve patient education should be initiated to mitigate these disparities.",11139462
"Uncontrolled donation after circulatory death (uDCD) increases organ availability for kidney transplantation (KT) at the expense of a higher risk of primary graft nonfunction (PNF). At least half of the cases of PNF are secondary to graft venous thrombosis. The potential benefit from prophylactic anticoagulation in this scenario remains unclear. In this single-center retrospective study we compared 2 consecutive cohorts of KT from uDCD with increased (≥0.8) renal resistive index (RRI) in the Doppler ultrasound examination performed within the first 24–72 h after transplantation: 36 patients did not receive anticoagulation (“nonanticoagulation group”) and 71 patients underwent prophylactic anticoagulation until normalization of RRI in follow-up Doppler examinations (“anticoagulation group”). Anticoagulation was initiated at a median of 2 d (interquartile range, 2–3) after transplantation and maintained for a median of 12 d (interquartile range, 7–18). In 4 patients (5.6%), anticoagulation had to be prematurely stopped because of the development of a hemorrhagic complication. In comparison with the nonanticoagulation group, recipients in the anticoagulation group had a lower 2-wk cumulative incidence of graft venous thrombosis (19.4% versus 0.0%; P < 0.001) and PNF (19.4% versus 2.8%; P = 0.006). The competing risk analysis with nonthrombotic causes of PNF as the competitive event confirmed the higher risk of graft thrombosis in the nonanticoagulation group (P = 0.0001). The anticoagulation group had a higher incidence of macroscopic hematuria (21.1% versus 5.6%; P = 0.049) and blood transfusion requirements (39.4% versus 19.4%; P = 0.050) compared with the nonanticoagulation group. No graft losses or deaths were attributable to complications potentially associated with anticoagulation. Early initiation of prophylactic anticoagulation in selected KT recipients from uDCD with an early Doppler ultrasound RRI of ≥0.8 within the first 24–72 h may reduce the incidence of graft venous thrombosis as a cause of PNF.",11139466
"Germline epigenetic programming, including genomic imprinting, substantially influences offspring development. Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) plays an important role in Histone 3 Lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3)-dependent imprinting, loss of which leads to growth and developmental changes in mouse offspring. In this study, we show that offspring from mouse oocytes lacking the PRC2 protein Embryonic Ectoderm Development (EED) were initially developmentally delayed, characterised by low blastocyst cell counts and substantial growth delay in mid-gestation embryos. This initial developmental delay was resolved as offspring underwent accelerated fetal development and growth in late gestation resulting in offspring that were similar stage and weight to controls at birth. The accelerated development and growth in offspring from Eed-null oocytes was associated with remodelling of the placenta, which involved an increase in fetal and maternal tissue size, conspicuous expansion of the glycogen-enriched cell population, and delayed parturition. Despite placental remodelling and accelerated offspring fetal growth and development, placental efficiency, and fetal blood glucose levels were low, and the fetal blood metabolome was unchanged. Moreover, while expression of the H3K27me3-imprinted gene and amino acid transporter Slc38a4 was increased, fetal blood levels of individual amino acids were similar to controls, indicating that placental amino acid transport was not enhanced. Genome-wide analyses identified extensive transcriptional dysregulation and DNA methylation changes in affected placentas, including a range of imprinted and non-imprinted genes. Together, while deletion of Eed in growing oocytes resulted in fetal growth and developmental delay and placental hyperplasia, our data indicate a remarkable capacity for offspring fetal growth to be normalised despite inefficient placental function and the loss of H3K27me3-dependent genomic imprinting.",11139480
"Metastasis is the main cause of death in colorectal cancer (CRC). Metastasis is a sequential and dynamic process, but the development of tumor cells during this process is unclear. In this study, we aimed to reveal characteristics of tumor cell subset during CRC metastasis. Single-cell RNA sequence CRC data of normal epithelium, non-metastatic primary tumor, metastatic primary tumor, and liver metastases from gene expression omnibus (GEO) dataset were analyzed to reveal characteristics of CRC metastasis. Primary tumor tissues of three non-metastatic CRC and three metastatic CRC patients from Union Hospital of Tongji Medical College (Wuhan, China) were used to verify the characteristics of CRC metastasis. We identified a metastasis-related cancer cell subset EP1, which was characterized with a high expression of KRT17, LAMC2, EMP1, and PLAC8. EP1 had an enhanced cell–cell interaction, which interacted with SPP+ macrophages and drove them toward anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive phenotype. Dynamic changes in genes and TF regulons during the metastasis were also revealed. This study advanced our understanding of the development of tumor cells during CRC metastasis and further identified metastasis-related subset and potential therapeutic targets for the treatment and prevention of CRC metastasis.",11139507
"Multiple methods for collecting genetic samples from amphibians exist, each with their own implications for study design, animal welfare, and costs. Toe clipping is one common method, but there is ongoing debate regarding its potential detriment. Less invasive methods should be implemented, if efficacious, as amphibians are a particularly vulnerable vertebrate group. Skin and buccal swabbing are less invasive methods for genetic sampling, but the potential for contamination and a lower yield of DNA may exist. To compare these methods, we gathered skin swabs, buccal swabs, and toe clips from the same individuals of a relatively small anuran species, Blanchard’s Cricket Frog (Acris blanchardi). We then compared DNA yield, DNA purity, amplification success rate, and genotypic data quality among sample types. We found toe clips and buccal swabs generated similar DNA yield and purity, with skin swabs yielding significantly less DNA of significantly lower purity than the other sample types. Amplification success rate was significantly higher using toe clips compared to the other sample types, though buccal swab samples amplified more readily than skin swabs. Genotypic data from toe clips and buccal swabs did not differ significantly in quality, but skin swab data quality was significantly lowest among sample types. Thus, skin swabbing could produce erroneous data in some situations, but buccal swabbing is likely an effective substitute to toe clipping, even for small species. Our results can help future researchers select which genetic sampling method might best suit their research needs.",11139508
"Stroke is a high morbidity and mortality disease that poses a serious threat to people's health. Early recognition of the various warning signs of stroke is necessary so that timely clinical intervention can help reduce the severity of stroke. Deep neural networks have powerful feature representation capabilities and can automatically learn discriminant features from large amounts of data. This paper uses a range of physiological characteristic parameters and collaborates with deep neural networks, such as the Wasserstein generative adversarial networks with gradient penalty and regression network, to construct a stroke prediction model. Firstly, to address the problem of imbalance between positive and negative samples in the stroke public data set, we performed positive sample data augmentation and utilized WGAN-GP to generate stroke data with high fidelity and used it for the training of the prediction network model. Then, the relationship between observable physiological characteristic parameters and the predicted risk of suffering a stroke was modeled as a nonlinear mapping transformation, and a stroke prediction model based on a deep regression network was designed. Finally, the proposed method is compared with commonly used machine learning-based classification algorithms such as decision tree, random forest, support vector machine, and artificial neural networks. The prediction results of the proposed method are optimal in the comprehensive measurement index F. Further ablation experiments also show that the designed prediction model has certain robustness and can effectively predict stroke diseases.",11139533
"The mechanism of steroidogenesis and spermatogenesis impairment in men with type 2 diabetes remains unclear. We aimed to explore the local changes of steroidogenesis and spermatogenesis in the testis of db/db mice. Research Design and Methods. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing analysis in the testis of db/db and C57BL/6J mice. The differentially expressed genes were then confirmed by real-time PCR. The histopathological characteristics of testis in db/db mice and C57BL/6J control were also performed.   The 20-week-old db/db mice had significantly higher blood glucose and body weight (both p < 0.001). The serum testosterone levels (4.4 ± 0.8 vs. 9.8 ± 0.7 ng/ml, p=0.001) and weight of the testis (0.16 ± 0.01 vs. 0.24 ± 0.01 g, p < 0.001) were significantly lower in db/db mice than that in C57BL/6J controls. db/db mice had a lower cross-sectional area of seminiferous tubules and thickness of the cell layer (both p < 0.05). The numbers of Sertoli cells and Leydig cells decreased in db/db mice (both p < 0.01). Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis showed that compared with the control group, the percentage of spermatogonia was significantly higher in the db/db mouse (p < 0.001), while the proportions of spermatocytes, round and elongating spermatids, and sperms were all lower in the db/db mouse (p all < 0.001). The most differentially expressed genes were found in round spermatids (n = 86), which were not found in spermatogonia, spermatocyte, and sperm. Igfbp5 was the most significantly decreased gene in Leydig cells of the db/db mouse, while the expression of Cd74, H2-Aa, and H2-Eb1 was elevated. Ccl7 and Ptgds were the most significantly increased and decreased genes in Sertoli cells of the db/db mouse.   The present study indicates spermiogenesis and steroidogenesis defects in db/db mice. The mechanism of steroidogenesis impairment in the testis of db/db mice deserves further investigation.",11139535
"A systematic review and meta-analysis have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy of alkalinization for COVID-19 patients based on current evidence to determine the impact of alkalinization on COVID-19 outcomes. We searched MEDLINE (Pubmed), Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Clinicaltrials.gov for studies evaluating the efficacy of alkalinization up to 30 April 2023. Based on the PRISMA 2020 statement criteria a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies were performed. The results of our meta-analysis showed a significant reduction in mortality rate in the alkalinization group compared to controls (RR 0.73, 95% CI: 0.56-0.95; I2  =  0%). However, our subgroup analysis showed no significant improvement in RCT-only studies (RR 0.78, 95% CI: 0.59-1.05; I2  =  0%), the recovery rate was significantly higher in the alkalinization group (RR 2.13, 95% CI: 1.39-3.26; I2  =  0%), duration of recovery also has improved in alkalinization group (SMD 0.76, 95% CI: 0.33-1.18; I2  =  0%). The results of our meta-analysis showed a significant reduction in the duration of hospitalization in the alkalinization group compared to controls with very low certainty of evidence (SMD −0.66, 95% CI: −0.97 to −0.35; I2  =  36%). With low certainty of evidence, alkalinization (by sodium bicarbonate) can be an efficient and safe adjuvant treatment for COVID-19 patients. Future randomized controlled trials are needed to strengthen the available evidence.",11145993
"Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) is a rare and aggressive hematological cancer. Due to its low incidence, researchers struggle to gather sufficient prospective data to inform clinical treatment. We sought to summarize the clinical characteristics and current treatment methods of BPDCN and provide more specific guidance on treatment options. A systematic literature review using data from 74 Chinese BPDCN patients. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical manifestations, treatment response, survival outcomes, and prognostic factors of six BPDCN patients treated at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University and 68 patients described in 28 articles published in the China Knowledge Network database since 2019. In Chinese patients, the disease occurred with a male-to-female ratio of 2.52 and a median age of onset of 50 years in adults and 10 years in pediatric patients. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed distinctive immune phenotypes of BPDCN cells, characterized by high expression levels of CD4, CD56, CD123, and HLA-DR, while showing minimal to no expression of myeloperoxidase (MPO), CD20, and CD79a. There was no significant difference in the initial complete remission (CR) rate, relapse rate, and the overall survival (OS) time of patients receiving acute myeloid leukemia-like, acute lymphocytic leukemia-like, or non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma-like chemotherapy regimens. Univariate analysis identified CD3 expression, male gender, and central nervous system infiltration as hazardous factors. In multivariate analysis, age proved to be an independent prognostic indicator, indicating better prognosis and longer OS time in younger patients. Notably, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) emerged as a significant factor in improving the survival outcomes for individuals diagnosed with BPDCN. However, further investigation is needed to explore the role of HSCT and the best timing for its implementation in pediatric BPDCN patients. Administering HSCT during the initial CR state following inductive chemotherapy might extend the OS and improve the prognosis of patients with BPDCN.",11145996
"Background: Tobacco use is a significant public health challenge, contributing to preventable diseases and premature deaths globally. We aimed to determine the prevalence of tobacco use and associated factors among men in Tanzania. Methods: This was a cross-sectional analysis of data from the 2022 Tanzania Demographic and Health Survey and Malaria Indicator Survey. The study population comprised men aged 15-49 years. Weighted logistic regression was performed to identify factors associated with tobacco use. Results: A total of 5763 men with a mean age of 28.6 ± 10 years were included in the analysis. The overall prevalence of tobacco use was 11.1%, with 95% of users consuming smoked products, 17.1% using smokeless products, and 12.1% using both smoked and smokeless products. Older age was associated with increased odds of tobacco use, with odds of tobacco use increasing with each higher age group. Similarly, alcohol consumption was associated with greater odds of tobacco use. On the other hand, having a secondary education or higher, lack of occupation, being the head of the household, and owning a mobile telephone were associated with lower odds of tobacco use. Geographically, men from the Eastern zone and Zanzibar exhibited greater odds of tobacco use, while those from the Southern highlands zone had lower odds. Conclusion: This study revealed a significant prevalence of tobacco use among Tanzanian men and was associated with different individual, interpersonal, and community factors. The findings underscore the need for targeted interventions considering age-specific risk factors and geographical variations.",11145999
"Differential access to healthcare is associated with disparities in maternal outcomes. Telehealth is one approach for improving access to maternal services. However, little is known regarding how health systems leverage telehealth to close the access gap. This study examines how health systems have approached decisions about using telehealth for maternal services before and during the COVID-19 public health emergency and what factors were considered. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 15 health system leaders between July and October 2021 and June and August 2022. We used a rapid analysis followed by a content analysis approach. Five health systems did not provide maternal telehealth services before the PHE due to a lack of reimbursement. Two health systems provided limited services as research endeavors, and one had integrated telehealth into routine maternity care. During the PHE, all transitioned to telehealth, with the primary consideration being patient and staff safety. At the time of the interview, key considerations shifted to patient access, patient preferences, patient complexity, return on investment, and staff burnout. However, several barriers impacted telehealth use, including coverage of portable devices and connectivity. These issues were reported to be common among underinsured, low-income, and rural patients. Health systems with particularly advanced capabilities worked on approaches to fill access gaps for these patients. Some health systems prioritized telehealth to improve access to high-quality maternal services for patients at the highest risk of adverse outcomes. However, policy and patient-level barriers to equitable implementation of these services persist.",11146003
"Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries often occur when an athlete experiences an unexpected disruption, or perturbation, during sports. ACL injury rates may also be influenced by the menstrual cycle. To determine whether training adaptations to knee control and muscle activity during a perturbed single-leg squatting (SLS) task depend on menstrual cycle phase in female athletes. Controlled laboratory study. A total of 21 healthy female collegiate athletes (current or former [<3 years]) who competed in 9 different sports performed an SLS task in which they attempted to match their knee position (user signal) to a target signal. The protocol consisted of a 9-condition pretest, 5 sets of 3 training trials, and a 9-condition posttest. One perturbation was delivered in each condition by altering the resistance of the device. Sagittal knee control (absolute error between the target signal and user signal) was assessed using a potentiometer. Muscle activity during perturbed squat cycles was normalized to maximal activation and to corresponding muscle activity during unperturbed squat cycles (%unperturbed) within the same test condition. Athletes performed the protocol during a distinct menstrual cycle phase (early follicular [EF], late follicular [LF], midluteal [ML]). Two-way mixed analysis of variance was used to determine the effects of the menstrual cycle and training on knee control and muscle activity during task performance. Venous blood was collected for hormonal analysis, and a series of health questionnaires and anthropometric measures were also assessed to determine differences among the menstrual cycle groups. After training, athletes demonstrated better knee control during the perturbed squat cycles (lower absolute error, P < .001) and greater soleus feedback responses to the perturbation (%unperturbed, P = .035). Better knee control was demonstrated in the ML phase versus the EF phase during unperturbed and perturbed squat cycles (P < .039 for both). Quadriceps activation was greater in the ML phase compared with the EF and LF phases, both immediately before and after the perturbation (P < .001 for all). Athletes learned to improve knee control during the perturbed performance regardless of menstrual cycle phase. The best knee control and greatest quadriceps activation during the perturbed squatting task was found in the ML phase. These findings may correspond to a lower incidence of ACL injury in the luteal phase and alterations in exercise performance across the menstrual cycle.",11146038
"Intraspecific diversity plays a critical role in the resilience of Chinook salmon populations. California's Central Valley (CV) historically hosted one of the most diverse population complexes of Chinook salmon in the world. However, anthropogenic factors have dramatically decreased this diversity, with severe consequences for population resilience. Here we use next generation sequencing and an archive of thousands of tissue samples collected across two decades during the juvenile outmigration to evaluate phenotypic diversity between and within populations of CV Chinook salmon. To account for highly heterogeneous sample qualities in the archive dataset, we develop and test an approach for population and subpopulation assignments of CV Chinook salmon that allows inclusion of relatively low‐quality samples while controlling error rates. We find significantly distinct outmigration timing and body size distributions for each population and subpopulation. Within the archive dataset, spring run individuals that assigned to the Mill and Deer Creeks subpopulation exhibited an earlier and broader outmigration distribution as well as larger body sizes than individuals that assigned to the Butte Creek subpopulation. Within the fall run population, individuals that assigned to the late‐fall run subpopulation also exhibited an earlier and broader outmigration distribution and larger body sizes than other fall run fish in our dataset. These results highlight the importance of distinct subpopulations for maintaining remaining diversity in CV Chinook salmon, and demonstrates the power of genomics‐based population assignments to aid the study and management of intraspecific diversity.",11146144
"Microbial communities from extreme environments are largely understudied, but are essential as producers of metabolites, including enzymes, for industrial processes. As cultivation of most microorganisms remains a challenge, culture‐independent approaches for enzyme discovery in the form of metagenomics to analyse the genetic potential of a community are rapidly becoming the way forward. This study focused on analysing a metagenome from the cold and alkaline ikaite columns in Greenland, identifying 282 open reading frames (ORFs) that encoded putative carbohydrate‐modifying enzymes with potential applications in, for example detergents and other processes where activity at low temperature and high pH is desired. Seventeen selected ORFs, representing eight enzyme families were synthesized and expressed in two host organisms, Escherichia coli and Aliivibrio wodanis. Aliivibrio wodanis demonstrated expression of a more diverse range of enzyme classes compared to E. coli, emphasizing the importance of alternative expression systems for enzymes from extremophilic microorganisms. To demonstrate the validity of the screening strategy, we chose a recombinantly expressed cellulolytic enzyme from the metagenome for further characterization. The enzyme, Cel240, exhibited close to 40% of its relative activity at low temperatures (4°C) and demonstrated endoglucanase characteristics, with a preference for cellulose substrates. Despite low sequence similarity with known enzymes, computational analysis and structural modelling confirmed its cellulase‐family affiliation. Cel240 displayed activity at low temperatures and good stability at 25°C, activity at alkaline pH and increased activity in the presence of CaCl2, making it a promising candidate for detergent and washing industry applications.",11146146
"Ongoing climatic shifts and increasing anthropogenic pressures demand an efficient delineation of conservation units and accurate predictions of populations' resilience and adaptive potential. Molecular tools involving DNA sequencing are nowadays routinely used for these purposes. Yet, most of the existing tools focusing on sequence‐level information have shortcomings in detecting signals of short‐term ecological relevance. Epigenetic modifications carry valuable information to better link individuals, populations, and species to their environment. Here, we discuss a series of epigenetic monitoring tools that can be directly applied to various conservation contexts, complementing already existing molecular monitoring frameworks. Focusing on DNA sequence‐based methods (e.g. DNA methylation, for which the applications are readily available), we demonstrate how (a) the identification of epi‐biomarkers associated with age or infection can facilitate the determination of an individual's health status in wild populations; (b) whole epigenome analyses can identify signatures of selection linked to environmental conditions and facilitate estimating the adaptive potential of populations; and (c) epi‐eDNA (epigenetic environmental DNA), an epigenetic‐based conservation tool, presents a non‐invasive sampling method to monitor biological information beyond the mere presence of individuals. Overall, our framework refines conservation strategies, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of species' adaptive potential and persistence on ecologically relevant timescales.",11146150
"Myiasis is infestation of live human tissue by larva. It usually involves immunocompromised people or people living in unsanitary conditions. The cutaneous myiasis is most common type and can enter the skin with a pre-existing wound. Herein we present a case of an 18-year-old girl known case of Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa with cutaneous myiasis affecting the knee managed surgically with full recovery. Such case has not reported previously in the literature, and detailed management plan is described.",11146208
"Meningiomas, typically benign neoplasms originating in the central nervous system, display a predilection for female patients. Although they predominantly manifest within the cranial vault, ~25% of primary spinal neoplasms are attributed to these tumors. The occurrence of ossification in spinal meningiomas is an uncommon phenomenon, with scant documentation in medical literature. In this report, we detail the clinical journey of an octogenarian female patient afflicted with an ossified spinal meningioma, which was associated with left lower extremity weakness and reduced sensation. Diagnostic imaging, specifically magnetic resonance imaging, identified a mass exerting pressure on the spinal cord, necessitating its surgical removal. Subsequent histopathological examinations corroborated the initial diagnosis. Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging scans confirmed the absence of residual tumor tissue and ruled out recurrence. A comprehensive review of existing literature yielded 47 analogous cases, with a majority involving elderly female patients and the thoracic region of the spine being the most common site. The standard therapeutic approach is surgical intervention, which is often complicated by the tumor’s tenacious adherence to surrounding structures and the potential for ensuing operative complications. This case highlights the exceptional nature of ossified spinal meningiomas and emphasizes the critical need for meticulous surgical management.",11146216
"Dogs that had splenectomy are predisposed to fatal thrombotic conditions, and thrombocytosis is a risk factor for post-splenectomy hypercoagulability. However, in veterinary medicine, there are no specific therapeutic approaches for managing this hypercoagulability. This study aimed to determine the preventive effect of clopidogrel on post-operative hypercoagulability during the first 2 weeks post-splenectomy in dogs with splenic masses. This study included 12 dogs that had splenectomy. Seven dogs received no treatment (group A), and five were treated with clopidogrel (group B). Clopidogrel was loaded at 10 mg/kg on day 2 and continued at 2 mg/kg until day 14. Blood samples were collected on the day of surgery and 2, 7, and 14 days after splenectomy in both groups. In group B, thromboelastography (TEG) was performed on the same days. In group A, there was significant elevation of platelet counts on days 7 (p = 0.007) and 14 (p = 0.001) compared to day 0. In group B, the platelet counts were significantly elevated on day 7 (p = 0.032) but no significant difference was found on day 14 compared to day 0. Platelet counts on day 14 were significantly higher in group A than in group B (p = 0.03). The lower platelet counts were correlated with alterations in TEG parameters, and no significant differences were found in the K and α-angle values at all postoperative assessment points compared to day 0. Our study suggests that clopidogrel may reduce post-operative thrombocytosis and hypercoagulability in dogs that undergo splenectomy for splenic masses.",11146242
"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer-associated death worldwide. Beside early detection, early diagnosis, and early surgery, it is urgent to try new strategies for the treatment of HCC. Triptolide (TPL) has been employed to treat HCC. However, its clinical applications were restricted by the narrow therapeutic window, severe toxicity, and poor water-solubility. In this study, we developed cancer cell membrane-camouflaged biomimetic PLGA nanoparticles loading TPL (TPL@mPLGA) with the homologous targeting property for the treatment of HCC. The TPL@mPLGA was successfully prepared with particle size of 195.5 ± 7.5 nm and zeta potential at −21.5 ± 0.2 mV with good stability. The drug loading (DL) of TPL@mPLGA was 2.94%. After Huh-7 cell membrane coating, the natural Huh-7 cell membrane proteins were found to be retained on TPL@mPLGA, thus endowing the TPL@mPLGA with enhanced accumulation at tumor site, and better anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vivo when compared with TPL or TPL@PLGA. The TPL@mPLGA showed enhanced anti-tumor effects and reduced toxicity of TPL, which could be adopted for the treatment of HCC.",11146252
"To examine the lived experiences of children and adolescents coping with mental health issues and seeking mental health services in Saskatchewan during the COVID-19 pandemic. In our descriptive phenomenological qualitative study, we interviewed forty-six individuals, including children aged 8–15 and their parents. Thematic analysis was applied to interpret the interview data. Our analysis identified three key themes: pyscho-behavioural impact, academic impact, and social impact. The pandemic adversely affected children due to factors like changes in behaviours such as increased screen time and decreased physical activity, limited access to mental health services, and disruptions to schooling and social interactions. Coping mechanisms varied, ranging from the utilization of available mental health supports and services to individual and family-based strategies. Disparities in timely access to mental health services were evident, with financially stable families accessing private services, while others struggled, particularly in rural areas. Families demonstrated resilience through parental efforts to seek balance and prioritize safety amidst COVID-19 challenges. Social connectedness served as a crucial buffer against pandemic-induced stress. Children faced difficulty in accessing timely mental health services and supports. Echoing participant experiences, our findings emphasize the urgency of targeted interventions and policy adjustments to address existing gaps in mental health service accessibility and availability.",11146264
"Treating Helicobacter pylori and Clostridioides difficile coinfection presents a challenging clinical dilemma. Treating H. pylori may increase the risk of C. difficile, and antibiotics generally have been shown to increase the risk of C. difficile infection/recurrence. While it may be reasonable to delay H. pylori treatment, this is especially challenging when there is an acute indication to treat H. pylori such as peptic ulceration or bleeding. There are no guidelines on the management of H. pylori and C. difficile coinfection. We report a patient who had H. pylori and recurrent C. difficile coinfection and suggest a management algorithm based on literature review and our institutional experience. Our patient received quadruple therapy for H. pylori along with vancomycin prophylaxis, taper, and a dose of bezlotoxumab and experienced good outcomes with resolution of his gastrointestinal bleeding and diarrhea.",11146470
"Cardiac extraintestinal manifestations (EIMs) of Crohn's disease (CD) are uncommon. They include pericarditis, myocarditis, and arrhythmias; however, distinguishing these from alternative causes including medication-related adverse effects is often challenging. Leukocytoclastic vasculitis is another uncommon EIM of CD that may present with systemic involvement. We present a rare case of myocarditis associated with leukocytoclastic vasculitis occurring as EIMs of CD. The myocarditis proved refractory to standard therapy and biologics targeting underlying gut inflammation. She developed an inflammatory cardiomyopathy and symptoms consistent with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Anakinra was tried, but despite the initial response, it should be used cautiously in patients with CD.",11146495
"In this report we present a case of a 14-year-old girl with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) who experienced glycemic instability and multiple hormonal deficits, including diabetes insipidus, central hypothyroidism, and central adrenal insufficiency. Brain and sellar magnetic resonance imaging revealed a mass in the suprasellar region, which was confirmed to be a pituitary abscess through transsphenoidal biopsy. T1DM is a chronic systemic disease that can lead to suboptimal glycemic control and increased susceptibility to infections. Pituitary abscess is a rare and serious infection that can manifest with nonspecific signs and symptoms, as well as pituitary hormonal deficiencies. Currently, after a 6-year follow-up the pituitary hormone deficiencies have resolved apart from persistent partial diabetes insipidus. Through a review of the current literature, we discuss the clinical characteristics of pituitary abscess, the challenges in diagnosing it, and speculate on the potential clinical and pathophysiological relationship between this uncommon infection and T1DM in our patient.",11146635
"Soil transmitted helminthiasis (STH), Schistosoma haematobium and malaria co-infection lead to increased susceptibility to other infections and poor pregnancy outcomes among women of reproductive age (WRA). This study sought to establish risk factors, burden of co-infection with STH, S. haematobium and Plasmodium sp. among WRA in Kilifi County, Kenya.A mixed method cross-sectional study was conducted on 474 WRA in 2021. Simple random sampling was used to select WRA from four villages in two purposively sampled sub-counties. Study participants were interviewed, and stool samples collected and analysed using Kato-Katz technique for STH. Urine samples were collected for examination of S. haematobium while malaria microscopic test was done using finger prick blood samples. Further, 15 focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted with purposively selected WRA and qualitative data analyzed thematically using Nvivo software. Quantitative and qualitative methods were triangulated to comprehensively strengthen the study findings. Prevalence of S. haematobium was 22.3% (95%CI: 13.5–36.9), any STH 5.2% (95%CI: 1.9–14.3) and malaria 8.3% (95%: 3.8–18.2). Co-infections between any STH and S. haematobium was 0.8% (95%CI: 0.2–3.2) and between S. haematobium and malaria 0.8% (95%CI: 0.2–3.1). Multivariable analysis showed increased odds of any STH infections among participants in Rabai Sub-County, (aOR = 9.74; p = 0.026), businesswomen (aOR = 5.25; p<0.001), housewives (aOR = 2.78; p = 0.003), and casual laborers (aOR = 27.03; p<0.001). Qualitative analysis showed that the three parasitic diseases were common and responsible for possible causes of low birth weight, susceptibility to other infections and complications such as infertility and cancer later in life.The study demonstrated that STH, S. haematobium and malaria are still a public health problem to WRA. Some of the associated risks of infection were geographical location, socio-economic and WASH factors. Hence the need to implement integrated control efforts of the three parasitic infection.",11146690
"Problematic Internet use is characterized by excessive use of online platforms that can result in social isolation, family problems, psychological distress, and even suicide. Problematic Internet use has been associated with cannabis use disorder, however knowledge on the adult population remains limited. In Quebec, cannabis use has significatively increased since 2018, and it is associated with various risks in public safety, public health, and mental health. This study aims to identify factors associated with problematic Internet use among adult cannabis users and to better understand their experiences. This project is a mixed explanatory sequential study consisting of two phases. Phase 1 (n = 1500) will be a cross-sectional correlational study using probability sampling to examine variables that predispose individuals to problematic Internet use, characteristics associated with cannabis use, Internet use, and the mental health profile of adult cannabis users in Quebec. Descriptive analyses and regression models will be used to determine the relationship between cannabis use and Internet use. Phase 2 (n = 45) will be a descriptive qualitative study in the form of semi-structured interviews aimed at better understanding the experience and background of cannabis users with probable problematic Internet use. The results of this study will support the development of public policies and interventions for the targeted population, by formulating courses of action that contribute to the prevention and reduction of harms associated with cannabis use and problematic Internet use. Furthermore, an integrated knowledge mobilization plan will aid in the large-scale dissemination of information that can result useful to decision-makers, practitioners, members of the scientific community, and the general population regarding the use of cannabis and the Internet.",11146692
"In Australian remote communities, First Nations children with otitis media (OM)-related hearing loss are disproportionately at risk of developmental delay and poor school performance, compared to those with normal hearing. Our objective was to compare OM-related hearing loss in children randomised to one of 2 pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) formulations. In 2 sequential parallel, open-label, randomised controlled trials (the PREVIX trials), eligible infants were first allocated 1:1:1 at age 28 to 38 days to standard or mixed PCV schedules, then at age 12 months to PCV13 (13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, +P) or PHiD-CV10 (10-valent pneumococcal Haemophilus influenzae protein D conjugate vaccine, +S) (1:1). Here, we report prevalence and level of hearing loss outcomes in the +P and +S groups at 6-monthly scheduled assessments from age 12 to 36 months. From March 2013 to September 2018, 261 infants were enrolled and 461 hearing assessments were performed. Prevalence of hearing loss was 78% (25/32) in the +P group and 71% (20/28) in the +S group at baseline, declining to 52% (28/54) in the +P groups and 56% (33/59) in the +S group at age 36 months. At primary endpoint age 18 months, prevalence of moderate (disabling) hearing loss was 21% (9/42) in the +P group and 41% (20/49) in the +S group (difference −19%; (95% confidence interval (CI) [−38, −1], p = 0.07) and prevalence of no hearing loss was 36% (15/42) in the +P group and 16% (8/49) in the +S group (difference 19%; (95% CI [2, 37], p = 0.05). At subsequent time points, prevalence of moderate hearing loss remained lower in the +P group: differences −3%; (95% CI [−23, 18], p = 1.00 at age 24 months), −12%; (95% CI [−30, 6], p = 0.29 at age 30 months), and −9%; (95% CI [−23, 5], p = 0.25 at age 36 months). A major limitation was the small sample size, hence low power to reach statistical significance, thereby reducing confidence in the effect size. In this study, we observed a high prevalence and persistence of moderate (disabling) hearing loss throughout early childhood. We found a lower prevalence of moderate hearing loss and correspondingly higher prevalence of no hearing loss in the +P group, which may have substantial benefits for high-risk children, their families, and society, but warrant further investigation.

"Depression is one of the most common psychiatric disorders, affecting approximately 60% of people infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Low and middle-income countries (LMICs), including Ethiopia, bear a disproportionate burden of depression among HIV/AIDS patients. Several factors, including perceived stigma, have been linked to increased depression among HIV/AIDS patients. Therefore, we aimed to estimate the pooled effect of perceived stigma on depression among HIV/AIDS patients in Ethiopia. For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we systematically retrieved all relevant studies starting from January 1, 2000 to June 1, 2022 from PubMed, HINARI, and Google Scholar. This review included observational studies that reported the effect of perceived stigma on the prevalence of depression among HIV-positive adults in Ethiopia. The effect estimate of the pooled effect of perceived stigma on depression was conducted using DerSimonian-Laird’s random effect model using STATA/MP version 16. An adjusted odds ratio (AOR), along with a 95% confidence interval (CI), was conducted to estimate the strength of the association between perceived stigma and depression. Eleven studies with a total of 4,153 HIV-positive adults were included for meta-analysis. The results of the meta-analysis revealed that the odds of depression were higher among patients with perceived stigma (AOR: 3.78, 95% CI: 2.73, 5.24). The pooled prevalence of depression among HIV/AIDS patients in Ethiopia was 39% (95% CI: 32%, 46%) (I2 = 98%, p ≤ 0.0001). The subgroup analysis revealed that the primary studies conducted in the Oromia region had the highest pooled prevalence of depression at 48% (95% CI: 32%, 63%). The pooled estimates of the meta-analysis revealed that perceived stigma and depression were strongly associated. Stigma and depression screenings should be carried out for additional treatments and prevention, and programs supporting Ethiopia’s PLWHA population should be strengthened.",11146698
"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic immune-mediated disease characterized by joint inflammation and destruction. The disease typically affects small joints in the hands and feet, later progressing to involve larger joints such as the knees, shoulders, and hips. While the reasons for these joint-specific differences are unclear, distinct epigenetic patterns associated with joint location have been reported. In this study, we evaluated the unique epigenetic landscapes of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) from hip and knee synovium in RA patients, focusing on the expression and regulation of Homeobox (HOX) transcription factors. These highly conserved genes play a critical role in embryonic development and are known to maintain distinct expression patterns in various adult tissues. We found that several HOX genes, especially HOXD10, were differentially expressed in knee FLS compared with hip FLS. Epigenetic differences in chromatin accessibility and histone marks were observed in HOXD10 promoter between knee and hip FLS. Histone modification, particularly histone acetylation, was identified as an important regulator of HOXD10 expression. To understand the mechanism of differential HOXD10 expression, we inhibited histone deacetylases (HDACs) with small molecules and siRNA. We found that HDAC1 blockade or deficiency normalized the joint-specific HOXD10 expression patterns. These observations suggest that epigenetic differences, specifically histone acetylation related to increased HDAC1 expression, play a crucial role in joint-specific HOXD10 expression. Understanding these mechanisms could provide insights into the regional aspects of RA and potentially lead to therapeutic strategies targeting specific patterns of joint involvement during the course of disease.",11146700
"Economic evaluation of healthcare typically assumes that an identical health gain to different patients has the same social value. There is some evidence that the public may give greater value to gains for children and young people, although this evidence is not always consistent. We present a mixed methods study protocol where we aim to explore public preferences regarding health gains to children and young people relative to adults, in an Australian setting. This study is a Person Trade Off (PTO) choice experiment that incorporates qualitative components. Within the PTO questions, respondents will be asked to choose between treating different groups of patients that may differ in terms of patient characteristics and group size. PTO questions will be included in an online survey to explore respondent views on the relative value of health gains to different age groups in terms of extending life and improving different aspects of quality of life. The survey will also contain attitudinal questions to help understand the impact of question style upon reported preferences. Additionally, the study will test the impact of forcing respondents to express a preference between two groups compared with allowing them to report that the two groups are equivalent. One-to-one ‘think aloud’, semi-structured interviews will be conducted to explore a sub-sample of respondents’ motivations and views in more detail. Focus groups will be conducted with members of the public to discuss the study findings and explore their views on the role of public preferences in health care prioritisation based on patient age. Our planned study will provide valuable information to healthcare decision makers in Australia who may need to decide whether to pay more for health gains for children and young people compared with adults. Additionally, the methodological test of forcing respondent choice or allowing them to express equivalence will contribute towards developing best practice methods in PTO studies. The rationale for and advantages of the study approach and potential limitations are discussed in the protocol.",11146702
"The rapid spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A (H5N1) viruses in Southeast Asia in 2004 prompted the New Zealand Ministry for Primary Industries to expand its avian influenza surveillance in wild birds. A total of 18,693 birds were sampled between 2004 and 2020, including migratory shorebirds (in 2004–2009), other coastal species (in 2009–2010), and resident waterfowl (in 2004–2020). No avian influenza viruses (AIVs) were isolated from cloacal or oropharyngeal samples from migratory shorebirds or resident coastal species. Two samples from red knots (Calidris canutus) tested positive by influenza A RT-qPCR, but virus could not be isolated and no further characterization could be undertaken. In contrast, 6179 samples from 15,740 mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) tested positive by influenza A RT-qPCR. Of these, 344 were positive for H5 and 51 for H7. All H5 and H7 viruses detected were of low pathogenicity confirmed by a lack of multiple basic amino acids at the hemagglutinin (HA) cleavage site. Twenty H5 viruses (six different neuraminidase [NA] subtypes) and 10 H7 viruses (two different NA subtypes) were propagated and characterized genetically. From H5- or H7-negative samples that tested positive by influenza A RT-qPCR, 326 AIVs were isolated, representing 41 HA/NA combinations. The most frequently isolated subtypes were H4N6, H3N8, H3N2, and H10N3. Multivariable logistic regression analysis of the relations between the location and year of sampling, and presence of AIV in individual waterfowl showed that the AIV risk at a given location varied from year to year. The H5 and H7 isolates both formed monophyletic HA groups. The H5 viruses were most closely related to North American lineages, whereas the H7 viruses formed a sister cluster relationship with wild bird viruses of the Eurasian and Australian lineages. Bayesian analysis indicates that the H5 and H7 viruses have circulated in resident mallards in New Zealand for some time. Correspondingly, we found limited evidence of influenza viruses in the major migratory bird populations visiting New Zealand. Findings suggest a low probability of introduction of HPAI viruses via long-distance bird migration and a unique epidemiology of AIV in New Zealand.",11146706
"Optical microscopy videos enable experts to analyze the motion of several biological elements. Particularly in blood samples infected with Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi), microscopy videos reveal a dynamic scenario where the parasites’ motions are conspicuous. While parasites have self-motion, cells are inert and may assume some displacement under dynamic events, such as fluids and microscope focus adjustments. This paper analyzes the trajectory of T. cruzi and blood cells to discriminate between these elements by identifying the following motion patterns: collateral, fluctuating, and pan–tilt–zoom (PTZ). We consider two approaches: i) classification experiments for discrimination between parasites and cells; and ii) clustering experiments to identify the cell motion. We propose the trajectory step dispersion (TSD) descriptor based on standard deviation to characterize these elements, outperforming state-of-the-art descriptors. Our results confirm motion is valuable in discriminating T. cruzi of the cells. Since the parasites perform the collateral motion, their trajectory steps tend to randomness. The cells may assume fluctuating motion following a homogeneous and directional path or PTZ motion with trajectory steps in a restricted area. Thus, our findings may contribute to developing new computational tools focused on trajectory analysis, which can advance the study and medical diagnosis of Chagas disease.",11146708

"To clarify the morphological factors of the pelvis in patients with developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH), three-dimensional (3D) pelvic morphology was analyzed using a template-fitting technique. Three-dimensional pelvic data of 50 patients with DDH (DDH group) and 3D pelvic data of 50 patients without obvious pelvic deformity (Normal group) were used. All patients were female. A template model was created by averaging the normal pelvises into a symmetrical and isotropic mesh. Next, 100 homologous models were generated by fitting the pelvic data of each group of patients to the template model. Principal component analysis was performed on the coordinates of each vertex (15,235 vertices) of the pelvic homologous model. In addition, a receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve was calculated from the sensitivity of DDH positivity for each principal component, and principal components for which the area under the curve was significantly large were extracted (p<0.05). Finally, which components of the pelvic morphology frequently seen in DDH patients are related to these extracted principal components was evaluated. The first, third, and sixth principal components showed significantly larger areas under the ROC curves. The morphology indicated by the first principal component was associated with a decrease in coxal inclination in both the coronal and horizontal planes. The third principal component was related to the sacral inclination in the sagittal plane. The sixth principal component was associated with narrowing of the superior part of the pelvis. The most important factor in the difference between normal and DDH pelvises was the change in the coxal angle in both the coronal and horizontal planes. That is, in the anterior and superior views, the normal pelvis is a triangle, whereas in DDH, it was more like a quadrilateral.",11146717
"The high-quality development of SRDI enterprises is crucial for China to overcome critical technological bottlenecks and thereby achieve technological independence and strength. However, the factors driving the high-quality development of SRDI enterprises are not isolated elements, but rather a complex system of interconnected antecedents. This study employs the TOE framework and fuzzy set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) with 141 Chinese SRDI “little giant” listed companies as samples to explore how various factors contribute to their high-quality development. The findings indicate: (1) No single factor is necessary for SRDI enterprises’ high-quality development. (2) It is the synergy of multiple factors, in various combinations, that drives their high-quality development. (3) Technological innovation plays a key role in these pathways; SRDI enterprises should leverage their resources and capabilities for a synergistic technology-organization-environment match, selecting the most suitable development path. The results of this study not only enrich our understanding of the factors influencing SRDI enterprises’ high-quality development but also offer insights for both the enterprises and government policy-making.",11146719
"We present Isotòpia, an open-access database compiling over 36,000 stable isotope measurements (δ13C, δ15N, δ18O, δ34S, 87Sr/86Sr, 206Pb/204Pb, 207Pb/204Pb, 208Pb/204Pb, 207Pb/206Pb, and 208Pb/206Pb) on human, animal, and plant bioarchaeological remains dating to Classical Antiquity (approximately 800 BCE ‐ 500 CE). These were recovered from different European regions, particularly from the Mediterranean. Isotòpia provides a comprehensive characterisation of the isotopic data, encompassing various historical, archaeological, biological, and environmental variables. Isotòpia is a resource for meta-analytical research of past human activities and paleoenvironments. The database highlights data gaps in isotopic classical archaeology, such as the limited number of isotopic measurements available for plants and animals, limited number of studies on spatial mobility, and spatial heterogeneity of isotopic research. As such, we emphasise the necessity to address and fill these gaps in order to unlock the reuse potential of this database.",11146721
"Preclinical disease models are important for the advancement of therapeutics towards human clinical trials. One of the difficult tasks of developing a well-characterized model is having a reliable modality with which to trend the progression of disease. Acute rejection is one of the most devastating complications that can occur following organ transplantation. Specifically in cardiac transplantation, approximately 12% of patients will experience at least one episode of moderate or severe acute rejection in the first year. Currently, the gold standard for monitoring rejection in the clinical setting is to perform serial endomyocardial biopsies for direct histological assessment. However, this is difficult to reproduce in a porcine model of acute rejection in cardiac transplantation where the heart is heterotopically transplanted in an abdominal position. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is arising as an alternative for serial screening for acute rejection in cardiac transplantation. This is an exploratory study to create and define a standardized cardiac magnetic resonance screening protocol for characterizing changes associated with the presence of acute rejection in this preclinical model of disease. Results demonstrate that increases in T1 mapping, T2 mapping, left ventricular mass, and in late gadolinium enhancement are significantly correlated with presence of acute rejection.",11146723
"Multi beam forward looking sonar plays an important role in underwater detection. However, due to the complex underwater environment, unclear features, and susceptibility to noise interference, most forward looking sonar systems have poor recognition performance. The research on MFLS for underwater target detection faces some challenges. Therefore, this study proposes innovative improvements to the YOLOv5 algorithm to address the above issues. On the basis of maintaining the original YOLOv5 architecture, this improved model introduces transfer learning technology to overcome the limitation of scarce sonar image data. At the same time, by incorporating the concept of coordinate convolution, the improved model can extract features with rich positional information, significantly enhancing the model’s detection ability for small underwater targets. Furthermore, in order to solve the problem of feature extraction in forward looking sonar images, this study integrates attention mechanisms. This mechanism expands the receptive field of the model and optimizes the feature learning process by highlighting key details while suppressing irrelevant information. These improvements not only enhance the recognition accuracy of the model for sonar images, but also enhance its applicability and generalization performance in different underwater environments. In response to the common problem of uneven training sample quality in forward looking sonar imaging technology, this study made a key improvement to the classic YOLOv5 algorithm. By adjusting the bounding box loss function of YOLOv5, the model’s over sensitivity to low-quality samples was reduced, thereby reducing the punishment on these samples. After a series of comparative experiments, the newly proposed CCW-YOLOv5 algorithm has achieved detection accuracy in object detection mAP@0.5 Reached 85.3%, and the fastest inference speed tested on the local machine was 54 FPS, showing significant improvement and performance improvement compared to existing advanced algorithms.",11146725
"The prevalence of syphilis in Zambia remains high and is a critical public health concern. The Zambian Ministry of Health recommends universal screening and same-day treatment for syphilis in pregnancy, yet the syphilis screening rate is low, and treatment is poorly documented. The goal of this study was to document syphilis treatment rates and associated factors among pregnant women in care in Zambia. This retrospective cohort study included pregnant women diagnosed with syphilis according to rapid plasma reagin (RPR) screening during routine antenatal care (ANC) in Lusaka, Zambia in 2018–2019. The main outcome of interest was lack of documented BPG treatment during pregnancy. Additional information about pregnancy and neonatal outcomes, partner referral for therapy, and facility level stockout data were included. Patient characteristics were compared by treatment status using Pearson Chi-Square Test and logistic regression models were created to estimate the association between individual level-factors, facility type, and lack of BPG treatment. A Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test was used to evaluate facility-level data with significance set at p<0.05. Among 1,231 pregnant women who screened positive for syphilis at clinic, 643 (52%) lacked documented antibiotic treatment at the facility. BPG was the only antibiotic used to treat syphilis in the cohort and 8% of sex partners had evidence of referral for therapy. Preterm delivery rates were higher in women without documented BPG (43% vs 32%; p = 0.003). In adjusted models, only calendar year and hospital facility type were associated with lack of treatment. At the facility level, annual syphilis screening rates ranged from 37–65% and most (7/10) clinics reported at least one stockout of BPG. Treatment rates for syphilis in pregnancy in Zambia were low and BPG medication stockouts at the facility level were common. A consistent supply of BPG at all ANC facilities is needed to facilitate timely treatment and improve birth outcomes.",11146727
"Due to the increase in life expectancy and high-energy traumas, anterior column acetabular fractures (ACFs) are also increasing. While open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) is still the standard surgical procedure, minimally invasive, percutaneous fixation of osteoporotic acetabulum fractures (AF) are growing in popularity. The aim of this biomechanical study was to evaluate the biomechanical competence following antegrade fixation with a standard screw versus a cannulated compression headless screw. Eight anatomical osteoporotic composite pelvises were given an anterior column fracture. Two groups of eight specimens each (n = 8) for fixation with either a 6.5 mm cannulated compression headless screw in group Anterior Acetabulum Canulated Compression Headless Screw (AACCH), or with a 6.5 mm partially threaded cannulated screw in group Anterior Acetabulum Standard Screw (AASS) where compared. Each specimen was biomechanically loaded cyclically at a rate of 2 Hz with monotonically increasing compressive load until failure. Motions were assessed by means of optical motion tracking. Initial construct stiffness trended higher in group AACCH at 152.4 ± 23.1 N/mm compared to group AASS at 118.5 ± 34.3 N/mm, p = 0.051. Numbers of cycles and corresponding peak load at failure, were significantly higher in group AACCH at 6734 ± 1669 cycles and 873.4 ± 166.9 N versus group AASS at 4440 ± 2063 cycles and 644.0 ± 206.3 N, p = 0.041. Failure modes were breakout of the screws around the proximal entry point. From a biomechanical perspective, group AACCH was associated with superior biomechanical competence compared to standard partially threaded cannulated screws and could therefore be considered as valid alternative for fixation of anterior acetabulum fractures.",11146729
"The Organic Cation Transporter Novel 1 (OCTN1), also known as SLC22A4, is widely expressed in various human tissues, and involved in numerous physiological and pathological processes remains. It facilitates the transport of organic cations, zwitterions, with selectivity for positively charged solutes. Ergothioneine, an antioxidant compound, and acetylcholine (Ach) are among its substrates. Given the lack of experimentally solved structures of this protein, this study aimed at generating a reliable 3D model of OCTN1 to shed light on its substrate-binding preferences and the role of sodium in substrate recognition and transport. A chimeric model was built by grafting the large extracellular loop 1 (EL1) from an AlphaFold-generated model onto a homology model. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed domain-specific mobility, with EL1 exhibiting the highest impact on overall stability. Molecular docking simulations identified cytarabine and verapamil as highest affinity ligands, consistent with their known inhibitory effects on OCTN1. Furthermore, MM/GBSA analysis allowed the categorization of substrates into weak, good, and strong binders, with molecular weight strongly correlating with binding affinity to the recognition site. Key recognition residues, including Tyr211, Glu381, and Arg469, were identified through interaction analysis. Ach demonstrated a low interaction energy, supporting the hypothesis of its one-directional transport towards to outside of the membrane. Regarding the role of sodium, our model suggested the involvement of Glu381 in sodium binding. Molecular dynamics simulations of systems at increasing levels of Na+ concentrations revealed increased sodium occupancy around Glu381, supporting experimental data associating Na+ concentration to molecule transport. In conclusion, this study provides valuable insights into the 3D structure of OCTN1, its substrate-binding preferences, and the role of sodium in the recognition. These findings contribute to the understanding of OCTN1 involvement in various physiological and pathological processes and may have implications for drug development and disease management.",11146731
"Controlled Human Infection Models (CHIS) involve administering human pathogens to healthy participants in controlled medical settings, which can elicit complex bioethical issues. Understanding how the community perceives such studies can significantly increase the participant’s sense of cooperation and increases the researcher’s and the participant’s transparency. The current study describes the development of an educational intervention to achieve these ends as it aims to (1) analyze perceptions of the Controlled Human Infection Studies (CHIS), and (2) evaluate the participants’ comprehension of the CHIS. Methods: This is a qualitative action research that includes the development of an educational intervention with residents of a rural area in Minas Gerais, Brazil, where there is continuous natural transmission of the human pathogen Necator americanus (“hookworm”). In this area, it is intended to carry out a proposed phase 3 vaccine clinical trial in the future to test the efficacy of hookworm vaccines using controlled human infection. Two data collection strategies were used: an educational intervention and a focus group. Results: The participants’ perceptions showed distinct perspectives on CHIS. On one side, they recognized that the investigation is essential for the community, but on the other side, they thought that there would be resistance to its conduct by fear of infection. The idea that the study would generate a benefit for the greater good, contributing to the prevention of hookworm infection, was clearly stated. The participants perceived that the study offered concrete risks that could be reduced by constant monitoring by the researchers. They also mentioned the importance of access to information and the positive influence those who express interest in participating in the study can exert in the community. In relation to comprehension the participants memorized the information, mobilized it to explain everyday situations and created strategies to disseminate the study and engage the community in its development. By repeating and making sense of the information, the participant not only assimilates the knowledge transmitted, but also creates new knowledge. Conclusion: We concluded that an educational process of discussion and dialogue around participants’ perceptions about the CHIS, promotes understanding and allows ways to disseminate information about the research to be collectively created.",11146735
"Physician adherence to evidence-based clinical practice parameters impacts outcomes of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients. We sought to investigate compliance with the 2009 practice parameters for treatment of ALS patients in the United States, and sociodemographic and provider characteristics associated with adherence. In this population-based, retrospective cohort study of incident ALS patients in 2009–2014, we included all Medicare beneficiaries age ≥20 with ≥1 International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification ALS code (335.20) in 2009 and no prior years (N = 8,575). Variables of interest included race/ethnicity, sex, age, urban residence, Area Deprivation Index (ADI), and provider specialty (neurologist vs. non-neurologist). Outcomes were use of practice parameters, which included feeding tubes, non-invasive ventilation (NIV), riluzole, and receiving care from a neurologist. Overall, 42.9% of patients with ALS received neurologist care. Black beneficiaries (odds ratio [OR] 0.56, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.47–0.67), older beneficiaries (OR 0.964, 95% CI 0.961–0.968 per year), and those living in disadvantaged areas (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.61–0.80) received less care from neurologists. Overall, only 26.7% of beneficiaries received a feeding tube, 19.2% NIV, and 15.3% riluzole. Neurologist-treated patients were more likely to receive interventions than other ALS patients: feeding tube (OR 2.80, 95% CI 2.52–3.11); NIV (OR 10.8, 95% CI 9.28–12.6); and riluzole (OR 7.67, 95% CI 6.13–9.58), after adjusting for sociodemographics. These associations remained marked and significant when we excluded ALS patients who subsequently received a code for other diseases that mimic ALS. ALS patients treated by neurologists received care consistent with practice parameters more often than those not treated by a neurologist. Black, older, and disadvantaged beneficiaries received less care consistent with the practice parameters.",11146737
"Although an increasing number of studies have examined issues relating to the preservation and development of intangible cultural heritage (ICH), there has been limited research on how tourists perceive ICH. Moreover, UNESCO asserts that the concept of “authenticity” is not applicable to ICH, and so far, no valid instrument for measuring tourists’ subjective perceptions of ICH has been developed, even though their perceptions play a very important role in the preservation and development of ICH. Therefore, this paper aims to develop a measurement scale for ICH image, using both qualitative and quantitative research methods. Participant observation, semi-structured in-depth interviews, secondary data collection, and a literature review were conducted to generate the initial scale items, and then the main surveys were conducted to collect data for the model tests. Four dimensions were extracted by exploratory factor analysis: transmission, localization, vitality, and association. The reliability and validity of the measurement model were demonstrated through confirmatory factor analysis. We further determined that the transmission, vitality, and association of ICH image have a positive impact on tourists’ revisit intention. The paper highlights the crucial role of ICH image in sustainable tourism development. The theoretical and managerial implications of the study are discussed, followed by suggestions for future research.",11146741
"In order to ensure the safety of coal mine production, a mine water source identification model is proposed to improve the accuracy of mine water inrush source identification and effectively prevent water inrush accidents based on kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) and improved sparrow search algorithm (ISSA) optimized kernel extreme learning machine (KELM). Taking Zhaogezhuang mine as the research object, firstly, Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl-, SO2- 4 and HCO- 3 were selected as evaluation indexes, and their correlation was analyzed by SPSS27 software, with reducing the dimension of the original data by KPCA. Secondly, the Sine Chaotic Mapping, dynamic adaptive weights, and Cauchy Variation and Reverse Learning were introduced to improve the Sparrow Search Algorithm (SSA) to strengthen global search ability and stability. Meanwhile, the ISSA was used to optimize the kernel parameters and regularization coefficients in the KELM to establish a mine water inrush source discrimination model based on the KPCA-ISSA-KELM. Then, the mine water source data are input into the model for discrimination in compared with discrimination results of KPCA-SSA-KELM, KPCA-KELM, ISSA-KELM, SSA-KELM and KELM models. The results of the study show as follows: The discrimination results of the KPCA-ISSA-KELM model are in agreement with the actual results. Compared with the other models, the accuracy of the KPCA-ISSA-KELM model is improved by 8.33%, 12.5%, 4.17%, 21.83%, and 25%, respectively. Finally, when these models were applied to discriminate water sources in a coal mine in Shanxi, and the misjudgment rates of each model were 28.57%, 19.05%, 14.29%, 23.81%, 9.52% and 4.76%, respectively. From this, the KPCA-ISSA-KLEM model is the most accurate about discrimination and significantly better than other models in other evaluation indicators, verifying the universality and stability of the model. It can be effectively applied to the discrimination of inrush water sources in mines, providing important guarantees for mine safety production.",11146743
"The deep integration of higher education with digital technology represents an inevitable trend, and evaluating the interplay between higher education resources (HER) and digital infrastructure construction (DIC) holds significant value for advancing the development of digital higher education and mitigating regional disparities in China. This study establishes two comprehensive evaluation frameworks for HER and DIC. Panel data from 31 provinces, spanning the period from 2011 to 2020, are utilized for analysis. The coupling coordination degree (CCD) model is employed in this work to evaluate the synergy between HER and DIC in China. Furthermore, we analyze the regional differences, spatial distribution, and trend evolution of this synergy. The study results revealed that there is an initial decrease followed by an increase in the synergy between HER and DIC, and the overall CCD is at a moderate coordination, with the mean CCD of the eastern region being significantly higher than that of the other three regions, and the inter-regional difference is the main source of regional disparity in this synergy. The current state of synergistic development reveals a slight inclination towards multi-polarization, although the disparity in regional development was decreasing. Additionally, there is an observed convergence in the coordinated development of HER and DIC, with spatial factors playing a significant role. These findings offer empirical support for efforts to enhance the integration of HER and DIC, reduce regional disparities in higher education, and foster sustainable development in China’s higher education sector.",11146748

"Styxl2, a poorly characterized pseudophosphatase, was identified as a transcriptional target of the Jak1-Stat1 pathway during myoblast differentiation in culture. Styxl2 is specifically expressed in vertebrate striated muscles. By gene knockdown in zebrafish or genetic knockout in mice, we found that Styxl2 plays an essential role in maintaining sarcomere integrity in developing muscles. To further reveal the functions of Styxl2 in adult muscles, we generated two inducible knockout mouse models: one with Styxl2 being deleted in mature myofibers to assess its role in sarcomere maintenance, and the other in adult muscle satellite cells (MuSCs) to assess its role in de novo sarcomere assembly. We find that Styxl2 is not required for sarcomere maintenance but functions in de novo sarcomere assembly during injury-induced muscle regeneration. Mechanistically, Styxl2 interacts with non-muscle myosin IIs, enhances their ubiquitination, and targets them for autophagy-dependent degradation. Without Styxl2, the degradation of non-muscle myosin IIs is delayed, which leads to defective sarcomere assembly and force generation. Thus, Styxl2 promotes de novo sarcomere assembly by interacting with non-muscle myosin IIs and facilitating their autophagic degradation.",11147509
"Cancer immune evasion contributes to checkpoint immunotherapy failure in many patients with metastatic cancers. The embryonic transcription factor DUX4 was recently characterized as a suppressor of interferon-γ signaling and antigen presentation that is aberrantly expressed in a small subset of primary tumors. Here, we report that DUX4 expression is a common feature of metastatic tumors, with ~10–50% of advanced bladder, breast, kidney, prostate, and skin cancers expressing DUX4. DUX4 expression is significantly associated with immune cell exclusion and decreased objective response to PD-L1 blockade in a large cohort of urothelial carcinoma patients. DUX4 expression is a significant predictor of survival even after accounting for tumor mutational burden and other molecular and clinical features in this cohort, with DUX4 expression associated with a median reduction in survival of over 1 year. Our data motivate future attempts to develop DUX4 as a biomarker and therapeutic target for checkpoint immunotherapy resistance.",11147511
"Chondroblastoma is a rare benign cartilaginous tumor that accounts for approximately 1% of bone tumors, but it can be associated with lung metastasis in extremely rare cases, leading to a poor prognosis and death. Herein, we report the case of a 19-year-old male patient who presented with an aggressive chondroblastoma of the proximal humerus and bilateral lung metastasis. The patient was treated with wide local resection, partial metastasectomy, and denosumab. Denosumab treatment was effective in controlling metastatic progression and preventing local recurrence.",11147590
"To assess the risk variables related to the types of candidemia for each patient, who was admitted into the intensive care unit regardless of the patient with or without complete diagnosis of COVID-19, during the period of March 2019 to December 2022. The evaluation comparison of demographic and clinical data of COVID-19 positive and negative patients with candidemia confirmed in blood, 113 cases were assessed. Variables such as gender, age, age of hospitalization, history of hospitalization, concurrently infection, The acute physiology and chronic health evaluation-II scores, comorbidity checking, intubation, central venous catheter use, parenteral nutrition use, steroid use, antibiotic use, lymphopenia, and laboratory variables were evaluated. Candida species distribution, antifungal susceptibility in blood culture were determined. Coronavirus disease-19 was present in 62.8% of cases confirmed candidemia, and these cases were significantly different from COVID-19 negative cases. Significance was found in more intubation, central venous catheter use, parenteral nutrition, and steroid therapy in Group 2. There was no significance with species distribution and associated infection. In total, COVID-19 positive had higher hemoglobin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine transaminase, and white blood cell levels, which may be associated with the possibility of revealing and controlling candidemia. Candida albicans and Candida Parapsilosis (C. parapsilosis) are the species seen in infected COVID-19 patients, while C. parapsilosis and Candida tropicalis are found in non-COVID-19 ones. Risk factors were intubation, parenteral nutrition, central venous catheter, and steroid in the COVID-19 group.",11147592
"To analyze the immunohistochemical staining pattern of mismatch repair (MMR) proteins and p53 in endometrial carcinoma cases, including different subtypes and stages, to gain insights into their role in the pathogenesis and clinical behaviour of this malignancy. In this study, we investigate the association between MMR deficiency, p53 mutational status, and clinical outcomes in various subtypes of endometrial carcinoma. The immunohistochemical staining pattern of MMR proteins in 96 cases of endometrial carcinoma have been analyzed, including 72 endometrioid, 14 papillary serous, 5 clear cell, and 5 mixed Müllerian tumor. The results showed that 36 cases were MMR deficient, with the majority being of endometrioid subtype. The p53 immunostain showed a mutational pattern in a subset of cases, with a documented dismal prognosis. However, aforementioned stains failed to predict synchronous or metachronous cancers in 5 patients. These findings highlight the importance of MMR and p53 immunohistochemical staining in the classification, and prognosis of endometrial carcinoma.",11147594
"To study the prevalence of tumor marker (TM) carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), cancer antigen 125 (CA 125), and cancer antigen 15-3 (CA 15-3) levels in the Saudi population, based on gender, age, and demographic region, and whether the patients were referred by a hospital or self-referred. Retrospective analysis was carried out on 7,019 samples gathered from the Western, Northern, Central, Southern, and Eastern regions of Saudi Arabia between 2021-2022. The TMs were categorized into normal and abnormal levels, according to the reference ranges. Statistical analysis was carried out to assess the relations between variants (age groups, gender, and demographic regions) using the Chi-square test, and their correlations were assessed using Spearman’s test. Among all patients, CEA, CA 125, and CA 15-3 levels were found to be significantly correlated with age (p=0.0001). The CEA and CA 15-3 levels increased in both males and females with age. The CA 125 was shown to have an abnormally increased level in males with age. Increased levels of CEA, CA 125, and CA 15-3 TMs in the study population were significantly correlated with age. The CEA and CA 15-3 levels were within the normal range, while CA 125 levels were above the normal range in the older male population. These results suggest that the utilization of such TMs is age dependent and would have validity if applied with other parameters.",11147600
"Odontogenic infections can spread to the respiratory tract. Despite the known role of Tannerella forsythia as the primary pathogen in periodontitis, the association between T. forsythia infection and risk of pneumonia or lung abscess remains unknown. In this report, we present a case of lung abscess caused by T. forsythia infection. The pathogen was detected by metagenomic next‐generation sequencing (mNGS) in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of the patient. The clinical characteristics and possible mechanisms of the infection are discussed. T. forsythia is a conditional pathogen that can cause lung abscess in the presence of helper bacteria and reduced host immune status. The course of treatment should be personalized and might be longer than 3 months.",11147646
"Clozapine is the only antipsychotic approved for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, but without appropriate monitoring, it can be associated with potentially fatal outcomes. An International Adult Clozapine Titration Guideline categorizes patients into normal or slow metabolizers. Categorization provides clozapine titration schedules and recommends regular c-reactive protein (CRP) and clozapine concentration monitoring to reduce the risk of adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The impact of the guideline on clozapine ADRs has not been evaluated. A retrospective chart review assessed clozapine titrations, laboratory monitoring, ADRs, and discontinuations for clozapine-naive adult inpatients at a single center from January 1, 2013, to June 1, 2022. Each patient’s cumulative weekly clozapine dosage was compared with their guideline recommended dosage to create a percent accordance. Linear logistic regression evaluated the relationship between titration speed and the presence of an ADR, while descriptive statistics analyzed laboratory monitoring. Forty-three patients were included, with the majority being White males with schizophrenia. An inverse relationship existed between the last inpatient week clozapine dose percent accordance and the probability of an ADR. Nonobese patients were less likely than obese patients to experience an ADR (odds ratio = 0.17; 95% CI, 0.03-0.99). CRP and clozapine concentration monitoring was suboptimal. Based on our small retrospective review of primarily White males, more aggressive clozapine titrations did not increase ADRs. Future studies with more diverse samples are needed and should focus on specific ADRs, which may have increased occurrence with rapid titrations. Obese patients were at higher risk of ADRs, correlating with the guideline-recommended slower titrations for these patients.",11147652
"Primary pulmonary lymphoepithelioma‐like carcinoma (PLELC) is a subtype of lung carcinoma associated with the Epstein–Barr virus (EBV). The clinical predictive biomarkers of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) in PLELC require further investigation. We prospectively analysed EBV levels in the blood and immune tumor biomarkers of 31 patients with ICB‐treated PLELC. Viral EBNA‐1 and BamHI‐W DNA fragments in the plasma were quantified in parallel using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Progression‐free survival (PFS) was significantly longer in EBNA‐1 high or BamHI‐W high groups. A longer PFS was also observed in patients with both high plasma EBNA‐1 or BamHI‐W and PD‐L1 ≥ 1%. Intriguingly, the tumor mutational burden was inversely correlated with EBNA‐1 and BamHI‐W. Plasma EBV load was negatively associated with intratumoral CD8+ immune cell infiltration. Dynamic changes in plasma EBV DNA level were in accordance with the changes in tumor volume. An increase in EBV DNA levels during treatment indicated molecular progression that preceded the imaging progression by several months. Plasma EBV DNA could be a useful and easy‐to‐use biomarker for predicting the clinical activity of ICB in PLELC and could serve to monitor disease progression earlier than computed tomography imaging.",11147665
"The prevalence of gastrointestinal tumors continues to be significant. To uncover promising therapeutic targets for these tumors, we rigorously executed a Mendelian randomization (MR) study to comprehensively screen the blood metabolomes for potential causal mediators of five frequently encountered gastrointestinal tumors (Liver Cancer, Colorectal Cancer, Esophageal Cancer, Gastric Cancer and Pancreatic Cancer). We selected a comprehensive set of 137 distinct blood metabolites derived from three large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWASs) involving a total of 147827 participants of European ancestry. The gastrointestinal tumors-related data were obtained from a GWAS conducted within the Finnish study. Through meticulous MR analyses, we thoroughly assessed the associations between blood metabolites and gastrointestinal tumors. Additionally, a phenome-wide MR (Phe-MR) analysis was employed to investigate the potential on-target side effects of metabolite interventions. We have identified 1 blood metabolites, namely isovalerylcarnitine (ORlog10: 1.01; 95%CI, 1.01–1.02; P = 1.81×10−7), as the potential causal mediators for liver cancer. However, no potential pathogenic mediators were detected for the other four tumors. The current systematic MR analysis elucidated the potential role of isovalerylcarnitine as a causal mediator in the development of liver cancer. Leveraging the power of Phe-MR study facilitated the identification of potential adverse effects associated with drug targets for liver cancer prevention. Considering the weighing of pros and cons, isovalerylcarnitine emerges as a promising candidate for targeted drug interventions in the realm of liver cancer prevention.",11139295
"The CRISPR-associated endonuclease Cas12a has become a powerful genome-editing tool in biomedical research due to its ease of use and low off-targeting. However, the size of Cas12a severely limits clinical applications such as adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based gene therapy. Here, we characterized a novel compact Cas12a ortholog, termed EbCas12a, from the metagenome-assembled genome of a currently unclassified Erysipelotrichia. It has the PAM sequence of 5′-TTTV-3′ (V = A, G, C) and the smallest size of approximately 3.47 kb among the Cas12a orthologs reported so far. In addition, enhanced EbCas12a (enEbCas12a) was also designed to have comparable editing efficiency with higher specificity to AsCas12a and LbCas12a in mammalian cells at multiple target sites. Based on the compact enEbCas12a, an all-in-one AAV delivery system with crRNA for Cas12a was developed for both in vitro and in vivo applications. Overall, the novel smallest high-fidelity enEbCas12a, this first case of the all-in-one AAV delivery for Cas12a could greatly boost future gene therapy and scientific research.",11139299
"Preeclampsia (PE) is characterized by hypertension and proteinuria mostly after 20 weeks of gestation. It affects 2–8% of pregnancies worldwide, with detrimental consequences for both mother and foetus. Evidence, suggests that genetic factors, including vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene polymorphisms, could contribute to PE complexity. However, their role in the Ghanaian population remains underexplored. We assessed the interplay between Vitamin D, VDR gene variants and preeclampsia risk in Ghanaian women. This unmatched case-control study was conducted at Kumasi South Hospital, Ghana, from June to November 2022. A total of 162 participants consisting of 62 PE cases and 100 normotensive controls were enrolled. Clinical and obstetric data were collected. Blood samples were also collected for DNA extraction and vitamin D assay. Genotyping of VDR Fok1 and Bsm1 gene variants was performed using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and Polymerase Chain Reaction—Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis whereas Vitamin D levels were estimated using sandwich ELISA. Statistical analyses were computed with SPSS version 25 and GraphPad prism version 8.0. A p-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Vitamin D concentration were significantly lower in the PE group (p < 0.0001). Vitamin D deficiency (aOR = 3.311, 95% CI: 1.584–6.921, p = 0.0010) was significantly associated with a three-fold increase in preeclampsia risk, whilst VDR gene variants, particularly the ""bb"" genotype (cOR = 0.227, 95% CI: 0.055–0.944, p = 0.0410) was associated with reduced risk of PE. There was no association between the distribution of Fok1 genotypes and PE. This study highlights a significant association between vitamin D deficiency and an increased risk of PE among Ghanaian women. However, the VDR gene variant, ""bb"", genotype, for Bsm1 reduces the risk of PE.",11139312
"To explore the causal relationship between ulcerative colitis (UC) and male infertility using Mendelian randomization method with single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) as the instrumental variables. Genetic loci closely associated with UC were extracted as instrumental variables and male infertility was the outcome variable in pooled data from the gene-wide association study (GWAS),which was derived from European ethnic groups. The UC data(ebi-a-GCST003045) contained a total sample size of 27432 individuals and 110944 SNPs, and the male infertility data(finn-b-N14_MALEINFERT) contained a total sample size of 73479 individuals and 16377329 SNPs. The SNPs highly correlated with UC were screened from ebi-a-GCST003045(P<5×10−8 as the screening condition, the linkage disequilibrium coefficient was 0.001,and the width of the linkage disequilibrium area was 10000 kb).SNPs related to male infertility from finn-b-N14_MALEINFERT (the minimum r2>0.8,replacing the missing SNPs with SNPs with high linkage, and deleting SNPs without substitution sites) were extracted. MR analysis was performed using MR-Egger regression, the weighted median and the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) respectively, and the causal relationship between UC and male infertility was evaluated by OR and 95% CI, and the Egger-intercept method was used to test for horizontal multiplicity, and the sensitivity analysis was performed using ""leave-one-out method"". Finally, we used Bayesian Weighted Mendelian Randomization (BWMR) approach to test the results of MR study. A total of 86 SNPs were included as IVs, with OR and 95% CI of 1.095(0.820~1.462)、1.059(0.899~1.248)、1.125(1.002~1.264) for MR-Egger, the weighted median and IVW results respectively, and P value of less than 0.05 for IVW, indicating that a causal relationship between UC and male infertility was causally related. The results of MR analysis combined with BWMR analysis also showed positive genetic causal relationship between UC and male infertility.MR-Egger regression showed an intercept of -2.21×10−3 with a standard error of 0.006 and P = 0.751, there was no horizontal pleiotropy for the IVs of exposure factors. Heterogeneity tests showed no heterogeneity and the results of the ""leave-one-out"" sensitivity analysis were stable. There is a causal association between UC and male infertility, which increases the risk of developing male infertility.",11139326
"The ADAMTS Like 2 (ADAMTSL2) mutation has been identified to be associated with different human genetic diseases. The role of ADAMTSL2 is unclear in colorectal cancer (CRC). The study investigated the expression of ADAMTSL2 in both pan cancer and CRC, using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database to assess its diagnostic value. The study examined the correlation between ADAMTSL2 expression levels and clinical characteristics, as well as prognosis in CRC. The study explored potential regulatory networks involving ADAMTSL2, including its association with immune infiltration, immune checkpoint genes, tumor mutational burden (TMB) / microsatellite instability (MSI), tumor stemness index (mRNAsi), and drug sensitivity in CRC. ADAMTSL2 expression was validated using GSE71187 and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). ADAMTSL2 was aberrantly expressed in pan cancer and CRC. An increased level of ADAMTSL2 expression in patients with CRC was significantly associated with the pathologic N stage (p < 0.001), pathologic stage (p < 0.001), age (p < 0.001), histological type (p < 0.001), and neoplasm type (p = 0.001). The high expression of ADAMTSL2 in patients with CRC was found to be significantly associated with a poorer overall survival (OS) (HR: 1.67; 95% CI: 1.18–2.38; p = 0.004), progression-free survival (PFS) (HR: 1.55; 95% CI: 1.14–2.11; p = 0.005) and disease-specific survival (DSS) (HR: 1.83; 95% CI: 1.16–2.89; p = 0.010). The expression of ADAMTSL2 in patients with CRC (p = 0.009) was identified as an independent prognostic determinant. ADAMTSL2 was associated with extracellular matrix receptor (ECM-receptor) interaction, transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling pathway, and more. ADAMTSL2 expression was correlated with immune infiltration, immune checkpoint genes, TMB / MSI and mRNAsi in CRC. ADAMTSL2 expression was significantly and negatively correlated with 1-BET-762, Trametinib, and WZ3105 in CRC. ADAMTSL2 was significantly upregulated in CRC cell lines. The high expression of ADAMTSL2 is significantly correlated with lower OS and immune infiltration of CRC. ADAMTSL2 may be a potential prognostic biomarker and immunotherapeutic target for CRC patients.",11139340
"Silencing pathways prevent transposable element (TE) proliferation and help to maintain genome integrity through cell division. Silenced genomic regions can be classified as either euchromatic or heterochromatic, and are targeted by genetically separable epigenetic pathways. In plants, the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway targets mostly euchromatic regions, while CMT DNA methyltransferases are mainly associated with heterochromatin. However, many epigenetic features - including DNA methylation patterning - are largely indistinguishable between these regions, so how the functional separation is maintained is unclear. The linker histone H1 is preferentially localized to heterochromatin and has been proposed to restrict RdDM from encroachment. To test this hypothesis, we followed RdDM genomic localization in an h1 mutant by performing ChIP-seq on the largest subunit, NRPE1, of the central RdDM polymerase, Pol V. Loss of H1 resulted in NRPE1 enrichment predominantly in heterochromatic TEs. Increased NRPE1 binding was associated with increased chromatin accessibility in h1, suggesting that H1 restricts NRPE1 occupancy by compacting chromatin. However, RdDM occupancy did not impact H1 localization, demonstrating that H1 hierarchically restricts RdDM positioning. H1 mutants experience major symmetric (CG and CHG) DNA methylation gains, and by generating an h1/nrpe1 double mutant, we demonstrate these gains are largely independent of RdDM. However, loss of NRPE1 occupancy from a subset of euchromatic regions in h1 corresponded to the loss of methylation in all sequence contexts, while at ectopically bound heterochromatic loci, NRPE1 deposition correlated with increased methylation specifically in the CHH context. Additionally, we found that H1 similarly restricts the occupancy of the methylation reader, SUVH1, and polycomb-mediated H3K27me3. Together, the results support a model whereby H1 helps maintain the exclusivity of heterochromatin by preventing encroachment from other competing pathways.",11139477
"The yeast SWR1C chromatin remodeling enzyme catalyzes the ATP-dependent exchange of nucleosomal histone H2A for the histone variant H2A.Z, a key variant involved in a multitude of nuclear functions. How the 14-subunit SWR1C engages the nucleosomal substrate remains largely unknown. Studies on the ISWI, CHD1, and SWI/SNF families of chromatin remodeling enzymes have demonstrated key roles for the nucleosomal acidic patch for remodeling activity, however a role for this nucleosomal epitope in nucleosome editing by SWR1C has not been tested. Here, we employ a variety of biochemical assays to demonstrate an essential role for the acidic patch in the H2A.Z exchange reaction. Utilizing asymmetrically assembled nucleosomes, we demonstrate that the acidic patches on each face of the nucleosome are required for SWR1C-mediated dimer exchange, suggesting SWR1C engages the nucleosome in a ‘pincer-like’ conformation, engaging both patches simultaneously. Loss of a single acidic patch results in loss of high affinity nucleosome binding and nucleosomal stimulation of ATPase activity. We identify a conserved arginine-rich motif within the Swc5 subunit that binds the acidic patch and is key for dimer exchange activity. In addition, our cryoEM structure of a Swc5–nucleosome complex suggests that promoter proximal, histone H2B ubiquitylation may regulate H2A.Z deposition. Together these findings provide new insights into how SWR1C engages its nucleosomal substrate to promote efficient H2A.Z deposition.",11139478
"The dynamic transcriptional mechanisms that govern eukaryotic cell function can now be analyzed by RNA sequencing. However, the packages currently available for the analysis of raw sequencing data do not provide automatic analysis of complex experimental designs with multiple biological conditions and multiple analysis time-points. The MultiRNAflow suite combines several packages in a unified framework allowing exploratory and supervised statistical analyses of temporal data for multiple biological conditions. The R package MultiRNAflow is freely available on Bioconductor (https://bioconductor.org/packages/MultiRNAflow/), and the latest version of the source code is available on a GitHub repository (https://github.com/loubator/MultiRNAflow).",11139518
"The quality scores data (QSD) account for 70% in compressed FastQ files obtained from the short and long reads sequencing technologies. Designing effective compressors for QSD that counterbalance compression ratio, time cost, and memory consumption is essential in scenarios such as large-scale genomics data sharing and long-term data backup. This study presents a novel parallel lossless QSD-dedicated compression algorithm named PQSDC, which fulfills the above requirements well. PQSDC is based on two core components: a parallel sequences-partition model designed to reduce peak memory consumption and time cost during compression and decompression processes, as well as a parallel four-level run-length prediction mapping model to enhance compression ratio. Besides, the PQSDC algorithm is also designed to be highly concurrent using multicore CPU clusters. We evaluate PQSDC and four state-of-the-art compression algorithms on 27 real-world datasets, including 61.857 billion QSD characters and 632.908 million QSD sequences. (1) For short reads, compared to baselines, the maximum improvement of PQSDC reaches 7.06% in average compression ratio, and 8.01% in weighted average compression ratio. During compression and decompression, the maximum total time savings of PQSDC are 79.96% and 84.56%, respectively; the maximum average memory savings are 68.34% and 77.63%, respectively. (2) For long reads, the maximum improvement of PQSDC reaches 12.51% and 13.42% in average and weighted average compression ratio, respectively. The maximum total time savings during compression and decompression are 53.51% and 72.53%, respectively; the maximum average memory savings are 19.44% and 17.42%, respectively. (3) Furthermore, PQSDC ranks second in compression robustness among the tested algorithms, indicating that it is less affected by the probability distribution of the QSD collections. Overall, our work provides a promising solution for QSD parallel compression, which balances storage cost, time consumption, and memory occupation primely. The proposed PQSDC compressor can be downloaded from https://github.com/fahaihi/PQSDC.",11139522
"Precision gene editing in primary hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) would facilitate both curative treatments for monogenic disorders as well as disease modelling. Precise efficiencies even with the CRISPR/Cas system, however, remain limited. Through an optimization of guide RNA delivery, donor design, and additives, we have now obtained mean precise editing efficiencies >90% on primary cord blood HSCPs with minimal toxicity and without observed off-target editing. The main protocol modifications needed to achieve such high efficiencies were the addition of the DNA-PK inhibitor AZD7648, and the inclusion of spacer-breaking silent mutations in the donor in addition to mutations disrupting the PAM sequence. Critically, editing was even across the progenitor hierarchy, did not substantially distort the hierarchy or affect lineage outputs in colony-forming cell assays or the frequency of high self-renewal potential long-term culture initiating cells. As modelling of many diseases requires heterozygosity, we also demonstrated that the overall editing and zygosity can be tuned by adding in defined mixtures of mutant and wild-type donors. With these optimizations, editing at near-perfect efficiency can now be accomplished directly in human HSPCs. This will open new avenues in both therapeutic strategies and disease modelling.",11147503
"Prenatal nicotine exposure (PNE) has been documented to cause numerous deleterious effects on fetal development. However, the epigenetic changes promoted by nicotine exposure on germ cells are still not well understood. In this study, we focused on elucidating the impact of prenatal nicotine exposure on regulatory epigenetic mechanisms important for germ cell development. Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to nicotine during pregnancy and male progeny was analyzed at 11 weeks of age. Testis morphology was analyzed using frozen testis sections and expression of germ cell markers was examined by RT-qPCR; histone modifications were assessed by Western Blot (WB). DNA methylation analysis was performed by methylation-specific PCR of bisulfite converted DNA. Genome-wide DNA methylation was analyzed using Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP)-seq. We also carried out transcriptomics analysis of pituitary glands by RNA-seq. We show that gestational exposure to nicotine reduces germ cell numbers, perturbs meiosis, affects the expression of germ line reprogramming responsive genes, and impacts the DNA methylation of nervous system genes in the testis. PNE also causes perturbation of gene expression in the pituitary gland of the brain. Our data demonstrate that PNE leads to perturbation of male spermatogenesis, and the observed effects are associated with changes of peripheral nervous system signaling pathways. Alterations in the expression of genes associated with diverse biological activities such as cell migration, cell adhesion and GABA signaling in the pituitary gland underscore the complexity of the effects of nicotine exposure during pregnancy.

"Low back pain (LBP) is one of the most common reasons for consultation in general practice. Currently, LBP is categorised into specific and non-specific causes. However, extravertebral causes, such as abdominal aortic aneurysm or pancreatitis, are not being considered. A systematic literature search was performed across MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane library, complemented by a handsearch. Studies conducted between 1 January 2001 and 31 December 2020, where LBP was the main symptom, were included. The literature search identified 6040 studies, from which duplicates were removed, leaving 4105 studies for title and abstract screening. Subsequently, 265 publications were selected for inclusion, with an additional 197 publications identified through the handsearch. The majority of the studies were case reports and case series, predominantly originating from specialised care settings. A clear distinction between vertebral or rare causes of LBP was not always possible. A range of diseases were identified as potential extravertebral causes of LBP, encompassing gynaecological, urological, vascular, systemic, and gastrointestinal diseases. Notably, guidelines exhibited inconsistencies in addressing extravertebral causes. Prior to this review, there has been no systematic investigation into extravertebral causes of LBP. Although these causes are rare, the absence of robust and reliable epidemiological data hinders a comprehensive understanding, as well as the lack of standardised protocols, which contributes to a lack of accurate description of indicative symptoms. While there are certain disease-specific characteristics, such as non-mechanical or cyclical LBP, and atypical accompanying symptoms like fever, abdominal pain, or leg swelling, that may suggest extravertebral causes, it is important to recognise that these features are not universally present in every patient. The differential diagnosis of extravertebral LBP is extensive with relatively low prevalence rates dependent on the clinical setting. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for extravertebral aetiologies, especially in patients presenting with atypical accompanying symptoms.",11075250
"Hereditary adenomatous polyposis syndromes, including familial adenomatous polyposis and other rare adenomatous polyposis syndromes, increase the lifetime risk of colorectal and other cancers. A team of 38 experts convened to update the 2008 European recommendations for the clinical management of patients with adenomatous polyposis syndromes. Additionally, other rare monogenic adenomatous polyposis syndromes were reviewed and added. Eighty-nine clinically relevant questions were answered after a systematic review of the existing literature with grading of the evidence according to Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology. Two levels of consensus were identified: consensus threshold (≥67% of voting guideline committee members voting either ‘Strongly agree’ or ‘Agree’ during the Delphi rounds) and high threshold (consensus ≥ 80%). One hundred and forty statements reached a high level of consensus concerning the management of hereditary adenomatous polyposis syndromes. These updated guidelines provide current, comprehensive, and evidence-based practical recommendations for the management of surveillance and treatment of familial adenomatous polyposis patients, encompassing additionally MUTYH-associated polyposis, gastric adenocarcinoma and proximal polyposis of the stomach and other recently identified polyposis syndromes based on pathogenic variants in other genes than APC or MUTYH. Due to the rarity of these diseases, patients should be managed at specialized centres.",11081080
"Many women reported experiencing abnormalities in their cycle after being vaccinated with Covid‐19 vaccination. To understand this issue further, our study aimed to evaluate the menstrual cycle patterns among women of childbearing age after receiving COVID‐19 vaccinations. A cross‐sectional study was conducted to investigate the impact of COVID‐19 vaccine on women aged 18 years and above in Saudi Arabia. A self‐administered online questionnaire was distributed among participants who had received at least one dose of COVID‐19 vaccine. The questionnaire included questions about the participants' demographic characteristics, medical history, and vaccine‐related adverse events. The study included 383 female participants with an average age of 30.8 ± 8.1 years. The majority of participants, 92.7%, were Saudi, and more than half, 51.4%, were single. Of the participants, 78.9% were disease‐free, and a majority of 67.9% had no history of Coronavirus Disease 2019 infection. A significant proportion of participants reported postvaccination changes in the menstrual cycle. Specifically, 43.1% reported changes after the first dose, and 38.4% reported changes after the second dose (p = 0.044). The severity of premenstrual symptoms increased from 44 (11.5%) to 113 (29.5%) after the first dose. Reported pain on the (WONG‐BAKER) scale was also significantly elevated from 34 (8.9%) to 87 (22.7%) (p < 0.001) after the first dose. A relatively high prevalence of menstrual cycle irregularities was reported by Saudi vaccinated women, particularly young adults. These findings suggest the need to further research and explore the underlying causes of these irregularities and develop interventions that may help mitigate their impact on women's health. It is also recommended that women who observe long‐term changes in their menstrual cycles seek follow‐up and consultation with healthcare providers to ensure that any potential health concerns are addressed promptly.",11082084
"Androgen resistance syndrome or androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS – Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome, OMIM 300068) is an X-linked recessive genetic syndrome causing disorders of sexual development in males. This disease is caused by mutations in the AR gene located on the X chromosome, which encodes the protein that structures the androgen receptor, with the role of receiving androgens. Mutation of the AR gene causes complete or partial loss of androgen receptor function, thereby androgen not being obtained and exerting its effect on target organs, resulting in abnormalities of the male reproductive system due to this organ system, differentiating towards feminization under the influence of estrogen. Disease prevention can be achieved by using pre-implantation genetic diagnosis, which enables couples carrying the mutation to have healthy offspring. To carry out preimplantation genetic diagnosis of androgen resistance syndrome. Sanger sequencing was used to detect the mutation in the blood samples of the couple, their son, and 01 embryo that were biopsied on the fifth day based on the findings of next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the affected son. We combined Sanger sequencing and linkage analysis using short tandem repeats (STR) to provide diagnostic results. We performed preimplantation genetic diagnosis for AIS on an embryo from a couple who had previously had an affected son. Consequently, one healthy embryo was diagnosed without the variant NM_000044: c.796del (p.Asp266IlefsTer30). We report on a novel variant (NM_000044: c.796del (p.Asp266IlefsTer30)) in the AR gene discovered in Vietnam. The developed protocol was helpful for the preimplantation genetic diagnosis process to help families with the monogenic disease of AIS but wish to have healthy children.",11082556
"The field of regenerative medicine has witnessed remarkable advancements with the emergence of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from a variety of sources. Among these, urine-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (u-iPSCs) have garnered substantial attention due to their non-invasive and patient-friendly acquisition method. This review manuscript delves into the potential and application of u-iPSCs in advancing precision medicine, particularly in the realms of drug testing, disease modeling, and cell therapy. U-iPSCs are generated through the reprogramming of somatic cells found in urine samples, offering a unique and renewable source of patient-specific pluripotent cells. Their utility in drug testing has revolutionized the pharmaceutical industry by providing personalized platforms for drug screening, toxicity assessment, and efficacy evaluation. The availability of u-iPSCs with diverse genetic backgrounds facilitates the development of tailored therapeutic approaches, minimizing adverse effects and optimizing treatment outcomes. Furthermore, u-iPSCs have demonstrated remarkable efficacy in disease modeling, allowing researchers to recapitulate patient-specific pathologies in vitro. This not only enhances our understanding of disease mechanisms but also serves as a valuable tool for drug discovery and development. In addition, u-iPSC-based disease models offer a platform for studying rare and genetically complex diseases, often underserved by traditional research methods. The versatility of u-iPSCs extends to cell therapy applications, where they hold immense promise for regenerative medicine. Their potential to differentiate into various cell types, including neurons, cardiomyocytes, and hepatocytes, enables the development of patient-specific cell replacement therapies. This personalized approach can revolutionize the treatment of degenerative diseases, organ failure, and tissue damage by minimizing immune rejection and optimizing therapeutic outcomes. However, several challenges and considerations, such as standardization of reprogramming protocols, genomic stability, and scalability, must be addressed to fully exploit u-iPSCs’ potential in precision medicine. In conclusion, this review underscores the transformative impact of u-iPSCs on advancing precision medicine and highlights the future prospects and challenges in harnessing this innovative technology for improved healthcare outcomes.",11084032
"In the meiotic prophase, homologous recombination repairs programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and promotes the synapsis and crossover between homologous chromosomes. In recombination-defective oocytes, DSBs and chromosome asynapsis persist. These oocytes are eliminated soon after birth to maintain genome integrity. BRCA1 is a DNA damage response protein thoroughly studied in somatic cells. In this study, we have identified two functions of BRCA1 during mammalian germline development: promoting meiotic recombination and eliminating recombination-defective oocytes. BRCA1 promotes chromosome asynapsis checkpoint, not canonical DNA damage checkpoint, to eliminate recombination-defective oocytes. Our study highlights the importance of chromosome asynapsis in triggering the elimination of recombination-defective oocytes.",11087798
"The parallel rise in obesity and male infertility in modern societies necessitates the identification of susceptibility genes underlying these interconnected health issues. In our study, we conducted a comprehensive search in the OMIM database to identify genes commonly associated with male infertility and obesity. Subsequently, we performed an insilico analysis using the REVEL algorithm to detect pathogenic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the coding region of these candidate genes. To validate our findings in vivo, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of SNPs and gene expression of candidate genes in 200 obese infertile subjects and 240 obese fertile individuals using ARMS-PCR. Additionally, we analyzed 20 fertile and 22 infertile obese individuals using Realtime-qPCR. By removing duplicated queries, we obtained 197 obesity-related genes and 102 male infertility-related genes from the OMIM database. Interestingly, the APOB gene was found in common between the two datasets. REVEL identified the rs13306194 variant as potentially pathogenic with a calculated score of 0.524. The study identified a significant association between the AA (P value = 0.001) genotype and A allele (P value = 0.003) of the APOB rs13306194 variant and infertility in obese men. APOB expression levels were significantly lower in obese infertile men compared to obese fertile controls (p < 0.01). Moreover, the AA genotype of rs13306194 APOB was associated with a significant decrease in APOB gene expression in obese infertile men (p = 0.05). There is a significant association between the Waist-to-Hip Ratio (WHR) and LH with infertility in the obese infertile group. These results are likely to contribute to a better understanding of the causes of male infertility and its association with obesity.

"Repetitive satellite DNAs, divergent in nucleic-acid sequence and size across eukaryotes, provide a physical site for centromere assembly to orchestrate chromosome segregation during the cell cycle. These non-coding DNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase (RNAP) II and the transcription has been shown to play a role in chromosome segregation, but a little is known about the regulation of centromeric transcription, especially in higher organisms with tandemly-repeated-DNA-sequence centromeres. Using RNA interference knockdown, chemical inhibition and AID/IAA degradation, we show that Topoisomerase I (TopI), not TopII, promotes the transcription of α-satellite DNAs, the main type of satellite on centromeres in human cells. Mechanistically, TopI localizes to centromeres, binds RNAP II and facilitates RNAP II elongation on centromeres. Interestingly, in response to DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs) induced by chemotherapy drugs or CRSPR/Cas9, α-satellite transcription is dramatically stimulated in a DNA damage checkpoint-independent but TopI-dependent manner. These DSB-induced α-satellite RNAs were predominantly derived from the α-satellite high-order repeats of human centromeres and forms into strong speckles in the nucleus. Remarkably, TopI-dependent satellite transcription also exists in mouse 3T3 and Drosophila S2 cells and in Drosophila larval imaginal wing discs and tumor tissues. Altogether, our findings herein reveal an evolutionally conserved mechanism with TopI as a key player for the regulation of satellite transcription at both cellular and animal levels.",11092777
"Phosphorylated H2AX, known as γH2AX, forms in response to genotoxic insults in somatic cells. Despite the high abundance of H2AX in zygotes, the level of irradiation-induced γH2AX is low at this stage. Another H2A variant, TH2A, is present at a high level in zygotes and can also be phosphorylated at its carboxyl end. We constructed H2AX- or TH2A-deleted mice using CRISPR Cas9 and investigated the role of these H2A variants in the DNA damage response (DDR) of zygotes exposed to γ-ray irradiation at the G2 phase. Our results showed that compared to irradiated wild-type zygotes, irradiation significantly reduced the developmental rates to the blastocyst stage in H2AX-deleted zygotes but not in TH2A-deleted ones. Furthermore, live cell imaging revealed that the G2 checkpoint was activated in H2AX-deleted zygotes, but the duration of arrest was significantly shorter than in wild-type and TH2A-deleted zygotes. The number of micronuclei was significantly higher in H2AX-deleted embryos after the first cleavage, possibly due to the shortened cell cycle arrest of damaged embryos and, consequently, the insufficient time for DNA repair. Notably, FRAP analysis suggested the involvement of H2AX in chromatin relaxation. Moreover, phosphorylated CHK2 foci were found in irradiated wild-type zygotes but not in H2AX-deleted ones, suggesting a critical role of these foci in maintaining cell cycle arrest for DNA repair. In conclusion, H2AX, but not TH2A, is involved in the DDR of zygotes, likely by creating a relaxed chromatin structure with enhanced accessibility for DNA repair proteins and by facilitating the formation of pCHK2 foci to prevent premature cleavage.",11094039
"By analyzing a mouse Interspecific Recombinant Congenic Strain (IRCS), we previously identified a quantitative trait locus (QTL), called Mafq1 on mouse chromosome 1, that is associated with male hypofertility and ultrastructural sperm abnormalities. Within this locus, we identified a new candidate gene that could be implicated in a reproductive phenotype: Tex44 (Testis-expressed protein 44). We thus performed a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated complete deletion of this gene in mice in order to study its function. Tex44-KO males were severely hypofertile in vivo and in vitro due to a drastic reduction of sperm motility which itself resulted from important morphological sperm abnormalities. Namely, Tex44-KO sperm showed a disorganized junction between the midpiece and the principal piece of the flagellum, leading to a 180° flagellar bending in this region. In addition, the loss of some axonemal microtubule doublets and outer dense fibers in the flagellum’s principal piece has been observed. Our results suggest that, in mice, TEX44 is implicated in the correct set-up of the sperm flagellum during spermiogenesis and its absence leads to flagellar abnormalities and consequently to severe male hypofertility.

"Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is well known for its biofilm formation ability and is responsible for serious, chronic refractory infections worldwide. We previously demonstrated that advanced glycation end products (AGEs), a hallmark of chronic hyperglycaemia in diabetic tissues, enhanced biofilm formation by promoting eDNA release via sigB upregulation in S. aureus, contributing to the high morbidity and mortality of patients presenting a diabetic foot ulcer infection. However, the exact regulatory network has not been completely described. Here, we used pull-down assay and LC-MS/MS to identify the GlmS as a candidate regulator of sigB in S. aureus stimulated by AGEs. Dual-luciferase assays and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) revealed that GlmS directly upregulated the transcriptional activity of sigB. We constructed NCTC 8325 ∆glmS for further validation. qRT-PCR analysis revealed that AGEs promoted both glmS and sigB expression in the NCTC 8325 strain but had no effect on NCTC 8325 ∆glmS. NCTC 8325 ∆glmS showed a significant attenuation in biofilm formation and virulence factor expression, accompanied by a decrease in sigB expression, even under AGE stimulation. All of the changes, including pigment deficiency, decreased haemolysis ability, downregulation of hla and hld expression, and less and sparser biofilms, indicated that sigB and biofilm formation ability no longer responded to AGEs in NCTC 8325 ∆glmS. Our data extend the understanding of GlmS in the global regulatory network of S. aureus and demonstrate a new mechanism by which AGEs can upregulate GlmS, which directly regulates sigB and plays a significant role in mediating biofilm formation and virulence factor expression.",11095574
"The gut microbiota operates at the interface of host–environment interactions to influence human homoeostasis and metabolic networks1–4. Environmental factors that unbalance gut microbial ecosystems can therefore shape physiological and disease-associated responses across somatic tissues5–9. However, the systemic impact of the gut microbiome on the germline—and consequently on the F1 offspring it gives rise to—is unexplored10. Here we show that the gut microbiota act as a key interface between paternal preconception environment and intergenerational health in mice. Perturbations to the gut microbiota of prospective fathers increase the probability of their offspring presenting with low birth weight, severe growth restriction and premature mortality. Transmission of disease risk occurs via the germline and is provoked by pervasive gut microbiome perturbations, including non-absorbable antibiotics or osmotic laxatives, but is rescued by restoring the paternal microbiota before conception. This effect is linked with a dynamic response to induced dysbiosis in the male reproductive system, including impaired leptin signalling, altered testicular metabolite profiles and remapped small RNA payloads in sperm. As a result, dysbiotic fathers trigger an elevated risk of in utero placental insufficiency, revealing a placental origin of mammalian intergenerational effects. Our study defines a regulatory ‘gut–germline axis’ in males, which is sensitive to environmental exposures and programmes offspring fitness through impacting placenta function.",11096121
"The extent of cell-to-cell variation in tumor mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number and genotype, and the phenotypic and evolutionary consequences of such variation, are poorly characterized. Here we use amplification-free single-cell whole-genome sequencing (Direct Library Prep (DLP+)) to simultaneously assay mtDNA copy number and nuclear DNA (nuDNA) in 72,275 single cells derived from immortalized cell lines, patient-derived xenografts and primary human tumors. Cells typically contained thousands of mtDNA copies, but variation in mtDNA copy number was extensive and strongly associated with cell size. Pervasive whole-genome doubling events in nuDNA associated with stoichiometrically balanced adaptations in mtDNA copy number, implying that mtDNA-to-nuDNA ratio, rather than mtDNA copy number itself, mediated downstream phenotypes. Finally, multimodal analysis of DLP+ and single-cell RNA sequencing identified both somatic loss-of-function and germline noncoding variants in mtDNA linked to heteroplasmy-dependent changes in mtDNA copy number and mitochondrial transcription, revealing phenotypic adaptations to disrupted nuclear/mitochondrial balance.",11096122
"The long-term effects of blood urea nitrogen(BUN) in patients with diabetes remain unknown. Current studies reporting the target BUN level in patients with diabetes are also limited. Hence, this prospective study aimed to explore the relationship of BUN with all-cause and cardiovascular mortalities in patients with diabetes. In total, 10,507 participants with diabetes from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1999–2018) were enrolled. The causes and numbers of deaths were determined based on the National Death Index mortality data from the date of NHANES interview until follow-up (December 31, 2019). Multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to calculate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence interval (CIs) of mortality. Of the adult participants with diabetes, 4963 (47.2%) were female. The median (interquartile range) BUN level of participants was 5 (3.93–6.43) mmol/L. After 86,601 person-years of follow-up, 2,441 deaths were documented. After adjusting for variables, the HRs of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality in the highest BUN level group were 1.52 and 1.35, respectively, compared with those in the lowest BUN level group. With a one-unit increment in BUN levels, the HRs of all-cause and CVD mortality rates were 1.07 and 1.08, respectively. The results remained robust when several sensitivity and stratified analyses were performed. Moreover, BUN showed a nonlinear association with all-cause and CVD mortality. Their curves all showed that the inflection points were close to the BUN level of 5 mmol/L. BUN had a nonlinear association with all-cause and CVD mortality in patients with diabetes. The inflection point was at 5 mmol/L. The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12872-024-03928-6.",11097526
"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant nevus disease characterized by multiple manifestations, primarily café-au-lait macules and neurofibromas. Here, we present the case of an NF1 patient with 47,XYY mosaicism whose diagnosis was prompted by café-au-lait macules on the skin and mandibular neurofibromas. Targeted next-generation sequencing of the patient’s blood sample revealed a novel frameshift mutation in NF1 (NM_000267.3:c.6832dupA:p.Thr2278Asnfs*8) that is considered a pathogenic variant.",11099053
"Livestock populations are under constant selective pressure for higher productivity levels for different selective purposes. This pressure results in the selection of animals with unique adaptive and production traits. The study of genomic regions associated with these unique characteristics has the potential to improve biological knowledge regarding the adaptive process and how it is connected to production levels and resilience, which is the ability of an animal to adapt to stress or an imbalance in homeostasis. Sheep is a species that has been subjected to several natural and artificial selective pressures during its history, resulting in a highly specialized species for production and adaptation to challenging environments. Here, the data from multiple studies that aim at mapping selective sweeps across the sheep genome associated with production and adaptation traits were integrated to identify confirmed selective sweeps (CSS). In total, 37 studies were used to identify 518 CSS across the sheep genome, which were classified as production (147 prodCSS) and adaptation (219 adapCSS) CSS based on the frequency of each type of associated study. The genes within the CSS were associated with relevant biological processes for adaptation and production. For example, for adapCSS, the associated genes were related to the control of seasonality, circadian rhythm, and thermoregulation. On the other hand, genes associated with prodCSS were related to the control of feeding behaviour, reproduction, and cellular differentiation. In addition, genes harbouring both prodCSS and adapCSS showed an interesting association with lipid metabolism, suggesting a potential role of this process in the regulation of pleiotropic effects between these classes of traits. The findings of this study contribute to a deeper understanding of the genetic link between productivity and adaptability in sheep breeds. This information may provide insights into the genetic mechanisms that underlie undesirable genetic correlations between these two groups of traits and pave the way for a better understanding of resilience as a positive ability to respond to environmental stressors, where the negative effects on production level are minimized.

"In recent decades, the survival of children with congenital anomalies and paediatric cancer has improved dramatically such that there has been a steady shift towards understanding their lifelong health outcomes. Paediatric surgeons will actively manage such conditions in childhood and adolescence, however, adult surgeons must later care for these ‘grown-ups’ in adulthood. This article aims to highlight some of those rare disorders encountered by paediatric surgeons requiring long-term follow-up, their management in childhood and their survivorship impact, in order that the adult specialist may be better equipped with skills and knowledge to manage these patients into adulthood. A comprehensive literature review was performed to identify relevant publications. Research studies, review articles and guidelines were sought, focusing on the paediatric management and long-term outcomes of surgical conditions of childhood. The article has been written for adult surgeon readership. This article describes the aforementioned conditions, their management in childhood and their lifelong implications, including: oesophageal atresia, tracheo-oesophageal fistula, malrotation, short bowel syndrome, duodenal atresia, gastroschisis, exomphalos, choledochal malformations, biliary atresia, Hirschsprung disease, anorectal malformations, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, congenital lung lesions and paediatric cancer. The increasing survivorship of children affected by surgical conditions will translate into a growing population of adults with lifelong conditions and specialist healthcare needs. The importance of transition from childhood to adulthood is becoming realized. It is hoped that this timely review will enthuse the readership to offer care for such vulnerable patients, and to collaborate with paediatric surgeons in providing successful and seamless transitional care.",11110943
"Numerous consensus documents worldwide address luteinizing hormone (LH) supplementation in controlled ovarian stimulation, yet to the best of our knowledge, only one consensus paper has been published in the Arab region. This study presents a Delphi consensus by seven Iranian infertility experts, offering real-world clinical perspectives. The aim was to develop evidence-based opinions on LH's role alongside FSH in various aspects of assisted reproductive technology (ART), including LH levels, monitoring, r-hLH use, and suggested activity. Employing the Delphi consensus approach, the Iran consensus unfolded in three steps. In Step 1, eight out of 10 statements gained approval, while two unclear statements were removed. In Step 2, the 20-member extended panel voted on the remaining eight statements. Only one (statement 3) lacked consensus (55% agreement), prompting a modification. The revised statement (noted as statement 3′) obtained an 83% agreement. The clinical perspectives included in this consensus complement clinical guidelines and policies that help further improve treatment outcomes, especially for patients with FSH and LH deficiencies.",11111922
"Mitochondria are hubs of metabolic activity with a major role in ATP conversion by oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). The mammalian mitochondrial genome encodes 11 mRNAs encoding 13 OXPHOS proteins along with 2 rRNAs and 22 tRNAs, that facilitate their translation on mitoribosomes. Maintaining the internal production of core OXPHOS subunits requires modulation of the mitochondrial capacity to match the cellular requirements and correct insertion of particularly hydrophobic proteins into the inner mitochondrial membrane. The mitochondrial translation system is essential for energy production and defects result in severe, phenotypically diverse diseases, including mitochondrial diseases that typically affect postmitotic tissues with high metabolic demands. Understanding the complex mechanisms that underlie the pathologies of diseases involving impaired mitochondrial translation is key to tailoring specific treatments and effectively targeting the affected organs. Disease mutations have provided a fundamental, yet limited, understanding of mitochondrial protein synthesis, since effective modification of the mitochondrial genome has proven challenging. However, advances in next generation sequencing, cryoelectron microscopy, and multi-omic technologies have revealed unexpected and unusual features of the mitochondrial protein synthesis machinery in the last decade. Genome editing tools have generated unique models that have accelerated our mechanistic understanding of mitochondrial translation and its physiological importance. Here we review the most recent mouse models of disease pathogenesis caused by defects in mitochondrial protein synthesis and discuss their value for preclinical research and therapeutic development.",11112386
"Conducting genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for reproductive traits in Hanwoo cattle, including age at first calving (AFC), calving interval (CI), gestation length (GL), and number of artificial inseminations per conception (NAIPC), is of paramount significance. These analyses provided a thorough exploration of the genetic basis of these traits, facilitating the identification of key markers for targeted trait improvement. Breeders can optimize their selection strategies, leading to more efficient and sustainable breeding programs, by incorporating genetic insights. This impact extends beyond individual traits and contributes to the overall productivity and profitability of the Hanwoo beef cattle industry. Ultimately, GWAS is essential in ensuring the long-term genetic resilience and adaptability of Hanwoo cattle populations. The primary goal of this study was to identify significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with the studied reproductive traits and subsequently map the underlying genes that hold promise for trait improvement. A genome-wide association study of reproductive traits identified 68 significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) distributed across 29 Bos taurus autosomes (BTA). Among them, BTA14 exhibited the highest number of identified SNPs (25), whereas BTA6, BTA7, BTA8, BTA10, BTA13, BTA17, and BTA20 exhibited 8, 5, 5, 3, 8, 2, and 12 significant SNPs, respectively. Annotation of candidate genes within a 500 kb region surrounding the significant SNPs led to the identification of ten candidate genes relevant to age at first calving. These genes were: FANCG, UNC13B, TESK1, TLN1, and CREB3 on BTA8; FAM110B, UBXN2B, SDCBP, and TOX on BTA14; and MAP3K1 on BTA20. Additionally, APBA3, TCF12, and ZFR2, located on BTA7 and BTA10, were associated with the calving interval; PAX1, SGCD, and HAND1, located on BTA7 and BTA13, were linked to gestation length; and RBM47, UBE2K, and GPX8, located on BTA6 and BTA20, were linked to the number of artificial inseminations per conception in Hanwoo cows. The findings of this study enhance our knowledge of the genetic factors that influence reproductive traits in Hanwoo cattle populations and provide a foundation for future breeding strategies focused on improving desirable traits in beef cattle. This research offers new evidence and insights into the genetic variants and genome regions associated with reproductive traits and contributes valuable information to guide future efforts in cattle breeding.

"Pregnancy-associated glycoproteins (PAG) secreted from fetoplacental binucleate cells are used in clinical practice for the early detection of bovine pregnancy. This study examined the postpartum PAG concentration to monitor binucleated cell clearance during postpartum uterine repair. PAG concentration was correlated with inflammatory parameters (serum amyloid A and milk amyloid A), postpartum inflammatory conditions (mastitis, ketosis, and follicular cysts), and FOXP3 gene-related repeat breeders. Excessive inflammation occurring during the postpartum period may reduce PAG concentration gradually. Clarifying the mechanism of decreased PAG concentration during the postpartum period has a beneficial effect on improving reproductive efficiency, performance, and reproduction aspects. We evaluated the relationship between decreased pregnancy-associated glycoprotein (PAG) levels, inflammatory parameters (serum amyloid A [SAA] and milk amyloid A [MAA]), postpartum inflammatory conditions (mastitis, ketosis, and follicular cysts), and the FOXP3 gene. Nineteen Holstein-Friesian cows were included in this study. Up to approximately eight weeks after delivery, weekly health examinations were performed for mastitis and ketosis, and reproductive organ ultrasonography was performed. The decreasing PAG rate was negatively correlated with SAA concentration (r = −0.493, p = 0.032). Cows with mastitis exhibited a slower trend of PAG decrease (p = 0.095), and a greater percentage of these cows had MAA concentrations above 12 µg/mL (p = 0.074) compared with those without mastitis. A negative correlation, although nonsignificant (r = −0.263, p = 0.385), was observed between the day-open period and decreased PAG rate. The day-open period was correlated with the presence or absence of follicular cysts (p = 0.046). Four cows that developed follicular cysts were homozygous for the G allele of the FOXP3 gene related to repeat breeders. These results indicate a relationship between a decreased PAG rate and inflammatory status during the postpartum period. Thus, suppressing inflammation during the perinatal period may improve reproductive efficiency in the dairy industry.",11117242
"Spermatogenesis is a highly efficient process that depends on the self-renewal and regulated differentiation of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) within the seminiferous tubules of the male mammalian testis. Male fertility requires the production of millions of gametes through the meiotic division of spermatocytes. We discovered that knocking out Etv5 in mice alters the expression of Wdr17, a gene crucial for spermatocyte development, by integrating bulk transcriptome sequencing data from the testes of Etv5 knockout mice with previously published single-cell transcriptome sequencing results. The levels of Wdr17 are strongly linked to cell survival and proliferation in mouse spermatocyte cell line GC-2spd(ts). Wdr17 could be a valuable gene target for investigating and controlling the processes of meiosis and spermatogenesis. We identified Wdr17 as a highly expressed gene in pachytene spermatocytes by transcriptomic analysis of mouse testis. Germ cell-deficient infertile mouse models had significantly reduced Wdr17 expression. We performed gene interference and overexpression in the mouse spermatocyte cell line GC-2spd(ts) and investigated how Wdr17 affects spermatocyte growth and development. Our results showed that Wdr17 suppression significantly decreased cell growth rate and increased cell apoptosis in GC-2spd(ts) cells. Wdr17 suppression also arrested the cell cycle at the G1 phase. On the contrary, Wdr17 overexpression significantly promoted cell proliferation and inhibited cell apoptosis in GC-2spd(ts) cells. More cells were enriched at the S stage with a concomitant reduction of cells at the G1 stage. Wdr17 promotes mouse spermatocyte proliferation by advancing cell cycle progression and inhibiting cell apoptosis, indicating its potential role in regulating spermatogenesis in the mouse.",11117263
"Endometriosis is characterized by the growth of endometrial-like tissue outside the uterus, and it is associated with alterations in the expression of hormone receptors and inflammation. Estetrol (E4) is a weak estrogen that recently has been approved for contraception. We evaluated the effect of E4 on the growth of endometriotic-like lesions and the expression of TNF-α, estrogen receptors (ERs), and progesterone receptors (PRs) in an in vivo murine model. Endometriosis was induced surgically in female C57BL/6 mice. E4 was delivered via Alzet pump (3 mg/kg/day) from the 15th postoperative day for 4 weeks. E4 significantly reduced the volume (p < 0.001) and weight (p < 0.05) of ectopic lesions. Histologically, E4 did not affect cell proliferation (PCNA immunohistochemistry) but it did increase cell apoptosis (TUNEL assay) (p < 0.05). Furthermore, it modulated oxidative stress (SOD, CAT, and GPX activity, p < 0.05) and increased lipid peroxidation (TBARS/MDA, p < 0.01). Molecular analysis showed mRNA (RT-qPCR) and protein (ELISA) expression of TNF-α decreased (p < 0.05) and mRNA expression of Esr2 reduced (p < 0.05), in contrast with the increased expression of Esr1 (p < 0.01) and Pgr (p < 0.05). The present study demonstrates for the first time that E4 limited the development and progression of endometriosis in vivo.",11118049
"As in most cells, intracellular pH regulation is fundamental for sperm physiology. Key sperm functions like swimming, maturation, and a unique exocytotic process, the acrosome reaction, necessary for gamete fusion, are deeply influenced by pH. Sperm pH regulation, both intracellularly and within organelles such as the acrosome, requires a coordinated interplay of various transporters and channels, ensuring that this cell is primed for fertilization. Consistent with the pivotal importance of pH regulation in mammalian sperm physiology, several of its unique transporters are dependent on cytosolic pH. Examples include the Ca2+ channel CatSper and the K+ channel Slo3. The absence of these channels leads to male infertility. This review outlines the main transport elements involved in pH regulation, including cytosolic and acrosomal pH, that participate in these complex functions. We present a glimpse of how these transporters are regulated and how distinct sets of them are orchestrated to allow sperm to fertilize the egg. Much research is needed to begin to envision the complete set of players and the choreography of how cytosolic and organellar pH are regulated in each sperm function.",11120249
"CHARGE syndrome, characterized by a distinct set of clinical features, has been linked primarily to mutations in the CHD7 gene. Initially defined by specific clinical criteria, including coloboma, heart defects, choanal atresia, delayed growth, and ear anomalies, CHARGE syndrome’s diagnostic spectrum has broadened since the identification of CHD7. Variants in this gene exhibit considerable phenotypic variability, leading to the adoption of the term “CHD7 disorder” to encompass a wider range of associated symptoms. Recent research has identified CHD7 variants in individuals with isolated features such as autism spectrum disorder or gonadotropin-releasing hormone deficiency. In this study, we present three cases from two different families exhibiting audiovestibular impairment as the primary manifestation of a CHD7 variant. We discuss the expanding phenotypic variability observed in CHD7-related disorders, highlighting the importance of considering CHD7 in nonsyndromic hearing loss cases, especially when accompanied by inner ear malformations on MRI. Additionally, we underscore the necessity of genetic counseling and comprehensive clinical evaluation for individuals with CHD7 variants to ensure appropriate management of associated health concerns.",11120670
"Several genes are implicated in spermatogenesis and fertility regulation, and these genes are presently being analysed in clinical practice due to their involvement in male factor infertility (MFI). However, there are still few genetic analyses that are currently recommended for use in clinical practice. In this manuscript, we reviewed the genetic causes of qualitative sperm defects. We distinguished between alterations causing reduced sperm motility (asthenozoospermia) and alterations causing changes in the typical morphology of sperm (teratozoospermia). In detail, the genetic causes of reduced sperm motility may be found in the alteration of genes associated with sperm mitochondrial DNA, mitochondrial proteins, ion transport and channels, and flagellar proteins. On the other hand, the genetic causes of changes in typical sperm morphology are related to conditions with a strong genetic basis, such as macrozoospermia, globozoospermia, and acephalic spermatozoa syndrome. We tried to distinguish alterations approved for routine clinical application from those still unsupported by adequate clinical studies. The most important aspect of the study was related to the correct identification of subjects to be tested and the correct application of genetic tests based on clear clinical data. The correct application of available genetic tests in a scenario where reduced sperm motility and changes in sperm morphology have been observed enables the delivery of a defined diagnosis and plays an important role in clinical decision-making. Finally, clarifying the genetic causes of MFI might, in future, contribute to reducing the proportion of so-called idiopathic MFI, which might indeed be defined as a subtype of MFI whose cause has not yet been revealed.",11120687
"Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) is an autosomal recessive disorder impairing cortisol synthesis due to reduced enzymatic activity. This leads to persistent adrenocortical overstimulation and the accumulation of precursors before the blocked enzymatic step. The predominant form of CAH arises from mutations in CYP21A2, causing 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21-OHD). Despite emerging treatment options for CAH, it is not always possible to physiologically replace cortisol levels and counteract hyperandrogenism. Moreover, there is a notable absence of an effective in vivo model for pre-clinical testing. In this work, we developed an animal model for CAH with the clinically relevant point mutation p.R484Q in the previously humanized CYP21A2 mouse strain. Mutant mice showed hyperplastic adrenals and exhibited reduced levels of corticosterone and 11-deoxycorticosterone and an increase in progesterone. Female mutants presented with higher aldosterone concentrations, but blood pressure remained similar between wildtype and mutant mice in both sexes. Male mutant mice have normal fertility with a typical testicular appearance, whereas female mutants are infertile, exhibit an abnormal ovarian structure, and remain in a consistent diestrus phase. Conclusively, we show that the animal model has the potential to contribute to testing new treatment options and to prevent comorbidities that result from hormone-related derangements and treatment-related side effects in CAH patients.",11120801
"Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) exhibits distinct characteristics distinguishing it from the nuclear genome, necessitating specific analytical methods in genetic studies. This comprehensive review explores the complex role of mtDNA in a variety of genetic studies, including genome-wide, epigenome-wide, and phenome-wide association studies, with a focus on its implications for human traits and diseases. Here, we discuss the structure and gene-encoding properties of mtDNA, along with the influence of environmental factors and epigenetic modifications on its function and variability. Particularly significant are the challenges posed by mtDNA’s high mutation rate, heteroplasmy, and copy number variations, and their impact on disease susceptibility and population genetic analyses. The review also highlights recent advances in methodological approaches that enhance our understanding of mtDNA associations, advocating for refined genetic research techniques that accommodate its complexities. By providing a comprehensive overview of the intricacies of mtDNA, this paper underscores the need for an integrated approach to genetic studies that considers the unique properties of mitochondrial genetics. Our findings aim to inform future research and encourage the development of innovative methodologies to better interpret the broad implications of mtDNA in human health and disease.",11121663
"Idiopathic recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) is defined as at least two pregnancy losses before 20 weeks of gestation. Approximately 5% of pregnant couples experience idiopathic RPL, which is a heterogeneous disease with various causes including hormonal, chromosomal, and intrauterine abnormalities. Although how pregnancy loss occurs is still unknown, numerous biological factors are associated with the incidence of pregnancy loss, including genetic variants. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was conducted on blood samples from 56 Korean patients with RPL and 40 healthy controls. The WES data were aligned by means of bioinformatic analysis, and the detected variants were annotated using machine learning tools to predict the pathogenicity of protein alterations. Each indicated variant was confirmed using Sanger sequencing. A replication study was also conducted in 112 patients and 114 controls. The Variant Effect Scoring Tool, Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion tool, Sorting Intolerant from Tolerant annotation tool, and various databases detected 10 potential variants previously associated with spontaneous abortion genes in patients by means of a bioinformatic analysis of WES data. Several variants were detected in more than one patient. Interestingly, several of the detected genes were functionally clustered, including some with a secretory function (mucin 4; MUC4; rs200737893 G>A and hyaluronan-binding protein 2; HABP2; rs542838125 G>T), in which growth arrest-specific 2 Like 2 (GAS2L2; rs140842796 C>T) and dynamin 2 (DNM2; rs763894364 G>A) are functionally associated with cell protrusion and the cytoskeleton. ATP Binding Cassette Subfamily C Member 6 (ABCC6) was the only gene with two variants. HABP2 (rs542838125 G>T), MUC4 (rs200737893 G>A), and GAS2L2 (rs140842796 C>T) were detected in only the patient group in the replication study. The combination of WES and machine learning tools is a useful method to detect potential variants associated with RPL. Using bioinformatic tools, we found 10 potential variants in 9 genes. WES data from patients are needed to better understand the causes of RPL.",11121708
"The highly conserved Notch pathway, a pillar of juxtacrine signaling, orchestrates intricate intercellular communication, governing diverse developmental and homeostatic processes through a tightly regulated cascade of proteolytic cleavages. This pathway, culminating in the migration of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) to the nucleus and the subsequent activation of downstream target genes, exerts a profound influence on a plethora of molecular processes, including cell cycle progression, lineage specification, cell–cell adhesion, and fate determination. Accumulating evidence underscores the pivotal role of Notch dysregulation, encompassing both gain and loss-of-function mutations, in the pathogenesis of numerous human diseases. This review delves deep into the multifaceted roles of Notch signaling in cellular dynamics, encompassing proliferation, differentiation, polarity maintenance, epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), tissue regeneration/remodeling, and its intricate interplay with other signaling pathways. We then focus on the emerging landscape of Notch aberrations in gynecological pathologies predisposing individuals to infertility. By highlighting the exquisite conservation of Notch signaling in Drosophila and its power as a model organism, we pave the way for further dissection of disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic interventions through targeted modulation of this master regulatory pathway.",11121885
"Background/Objectives: Esophageal achalasia is an archetypal esophageal motility disorder characterized by abnormal peristalsis of the esophageal body and impaired lower esophageal sphincter (LES) relaxation. Methods: In this study, the mRNA expression of docking proteins 1 and 2 (DOK1 and DOK2, respectively) were analyzed and the mechanisms underlying achalasia onset were investigated. Results: DOK1 and DOK2 mRNA levels significantly increased in the LES of patients with achalasia. Moreover, significant correlations were observed between IL-1β and DOK1, IL-1β and DOK2, ATG16L1 and DOK1, and HSV1-miR-H1-3p and DOK2 expression levels. However, a correlation between ATG16L1 and DOK2 or between HSV-miR-H1-3p and DOK1 expression was not observed. In addition, a positive correlation was observed between patient age and DOK1 expression. Microarray analysis revealed a significant decrease in the expression of hsa-miR-377-3p and miR-376a-3p in the LES muscle of patients with achalasia. Conclusions: These miRNAs possessed sequences targeting DOK. The upregulation of DOK1 and DOK2 expression induces IL-1β expression in the LES of achalasia patients, which may contribute to the development of esophageal motility disorder.",11122009
"BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations are responsible for a higher incidence of breast and ovarian cancer (from 55% up to 70% vs. 12% in the general population). If their functions have been widely investigated in the onset of these malignancies, still little is known about their role in fertility impairment. Cancer patients treated with antineoplastic drugs can be susceptible to their gonadotoxicity and, in women, some of them can induce apoptotic program in premature ovarian follicles, progressive depletion of ovarian reserve and, consequently, cancer treatment-related infertility (CTRI). BRCA variants seem to be associated with early infertility, thus accelerating treatment impairment of ovaries and making women face the concrete possibility of an early pregnancy. In this regard, fertility preservation (FP) procedures should be discussed in oncofertility counseling—from the first line of prevention with risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) to the new experimental ovarian stem cells (OSCs) model as a new way to obtain in vitro-differentiated oocytes, several techniques may represent a valid option to BRCA-mutated patients. In this review, we revisit knowledge about BRCA involvement in lower fertility, pregnancy feasibility, and the fertility preservation (FP) options available.",11122448
"Drought is one of the main abiotic factors affecting global agricultural productivity. However, the application of bioinocula containing plant-growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) has been seen as a potential environmentally friendly technology for increasing plants’ resistance to water stress. In this study, rhizobacteria strains were isolated from maize (Zea mays L.) and subjected to drought tolerance tests at varying concentrations using polyethylene glycol (PEG)-8000 and screened for plant-growth-promoting activities. From this study, 11 bacterial isolates were characterized and identified molecularly, which include Bacillus licheniformis A5-1, Aeromonas caviae A1-2, A. veronii C7_8, B. cereus B8-3, P. endophytica A10-11, B. halotolerans A9-10, B. licheniformis B9-5, B. simplex B15-6, Priestia flexa B12-4, Priestia flexa C6-7, and Priestia aryabhattai C1-9. All isolates were positive for indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), siderophore, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase, ammonia production, nitrogen fixation, and phosphate solubilization, but negative for hydrogen cyanide production. Aeromonas strains A1-2 and C7_8, showing the highest drought tolerance of 0.71 and 0.77, respectively, were selected for bioinoculation, singularly and combined. An increase in the above- and below-ground biomass of the maize plants at 100, 50, and 25% water-holding capacity (WHC) was recorded. Bacterial inoculants, which showed an increase in the aerial biomass of plants subjected to moderate water deficiency by up to 89%, suggested that they can be suitable candidates to enhance drought tolerance and nutrient acquisition and mitigate the impacts of water stress on plants.",11125291
"To review the outcome of PGT-M in hormone-related hereditary tumor syndrome and evaluate the effect of ovarian induction on tumor growth in those patients. Medical records of PGT-M were retrospectively analyzed in patients with hormone-related heritage tumors in our reproductive center. A total of eleven women with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) (including BRCA1/2 mutation carriers), and Lynch syndrome (including MMR gene mutation carriers) were included. Thirteen IVF/PGT-M cycles were performed. Eleven for PGT-M and two for fertility preservation. The ovulation protocol, numbers of oocytes retrieved and two pronuclei (2PN) zygotes, PGT-M results, and clinical outcomes were analyzed. Tumor progression was also estimated by comparing transvaginal ultrasound (TVS), MR, CT, or colonoscopy according to the follow-up requirements of different tumors. Eleven IVF/PGT-M cycles were performed with an antagonist protocol; Two cycles were performed with a mild stimulation protocol. The total dose of gonadotropin (Gn) was 1827 IU per patient (range from 1200 to 2625 IU). The median number of oocytes retrieved was 13 (range from 4 to 30), and the median number of 2PN zygotes was 8 (range from 2 to 16). A total of 32 embryos underwent PGT-M, and 9 (28.1%) embryos were suitable for transfer. Six transfer cycles were performed, and 5 cycles got clinical pregnancy (83%) with five newborns (83%). The follow-up examinations conducted 10-18 months after PGT-M/delivery revealed no new lesions or tumor progression. PGT-M results can provide important information for improving the consultation of hormone-related heritage tumor patients regarding their fertility preservation and reproductive options. Ovarian induction for women with hormone-related hereditary tumor syndrome is not associated with tumor progression.",11127562
"Pathogenic BAG5 variants recently linked to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) prompt further investigation into phenotypic, mutational, and pathomechanistic aspects. We explored the clinical and molecular characteristics of DCM associated with BAG5 variants, uncovering the consistently severe manifestations of the disease and its impact on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. The analysis involved three siblings affected by DCM and arrhythmia, along with their four unaffected siblings, their unaffected father, and their mother who exhibited arrhythmia. The parents were consanguineous. Exome and Sanger sequencing identified a novel BAG5 variant, c.444_445delGA (p.Lys149AsnfsTer6), homozygous in affected siblings and heterozygous in parents and unaffected siblings. We generated heterozygous and homozygous Bag5 point mutant knock-in (KI) mice and evaluated cardiac pathophysiology under stress conditions, including tunicamycin (TN) administration. Bag5−/− mice displayed no abnormalities up to 12 months old and showed no anomalies during an exercise stress test. However, following TN injection, Bag5−/− mice exhibited significantly reduced left ventricular fractional shortening (LVFS) and ejection fraction (LVEF). Their cardiac tissues exhibited a notable increase in apoptotic cells, despite non-distinctive changes in CHOP and GRP78 levels. Interestingly, only Bag5 KI male mice demonstrated arrhythmia, which was more pronounced in Bag5−/− than in Bag5+/−males. Here, our study reveals a novel BAG5 mutation causing DCM by impairing the ER stress response, with observed sex-specific arrhythmia differences.",11127938
"Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is a common cancer with a poor prognosis in advanced stages. Therefore, early EAC diagnosis and treatment have gained attention in recent decades. It has been found that various pathological changes, particularly Barrett's Esophagus (BE), can occur in the esophageal tissue before the development of EAC. In this study, we aimed to identify the molecular contributor in BE to EAC progression by detecting the essential regulatory genes that are differentially expressed in both BE and EAC. We conducted a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis to detect BE and EAC-associated genes. The common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected using the GEO and DisGeNET databases, respectively. Then, hub genes and the top modules within the protein-protein interaction network were identified. Moreover, the co-expression network of the top module by the HIPPIE database was constructed. Additionally, the gene regulatory network was constructed based on miRNAs and circRNAs. Lastly, we inspected the DGIdb database for possible interacted drugs. Our microarray dataset analysis identified 92 common DEGs between BE and EAC with significant enrichment in skin and epidermis development genes. The study also identified 22 common SNPs between BE and EAC. The top module of PPI network analysis included SCEL, KRT6A, SPRR1A, SPRR1B, SPRR3, PPL, SPRR2B, EVPL, and CSTA. We constructed a ceRNA network involving three specific mRNAs, 23 miRNAs, and 101 selected circRNAs. According to the results from the DGIdb database, TD101 was found to interact with the KRT6A gene. The present study provides novel potential candidate genes that may be involved in the molecular association between Esophageal adenocarcinoma and Barrett's Esophagus, resulting in developing the diagnostic tools and therapeutic targets to prevent progression of BE to EAC.",11128929
"SMG9 is an essential component of the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) machinery, a quality control mechanism that selectively degrades aberrant transcripts. Mutations in SMG9 are associated with heart and brain malformation syndrome (HBMS). However, the molecular mechanism underlying HBMS remains unclear. We generated smg9 mutant zebrafish (smg9oi7/oi7) that have a lifespan of approximately 6 months or longer, allowing for analysis of the in vivo function of Smg9 in adults in more detail. smg9oi7/oi7 zebrafish display congenital brain abnormalities and reduced cardiac contraction. Additionally, smg9oi7/oi7 zebrafish exhibit a premature aging phenotype. Analysis of NMD target mRNAs shows a trend toward increased mRNA levels in smg9oi7/oi7 zebrafish. Spermidine oxidase (Smox) is increased in smg9oi7/oi7 zebrafish, resulting in the accumulation of byproducts, reactive oxygen species, and acrolein. The accumulation of smox mRNA due to NMD dysregulation caused by Smg9 deficiency leads to increased oxidative stress, resulting in premature aging.",11133409
"IL-2Rα knock out (KO) mice have been instrumental to discovering the immunoregulatory properties of IL-2Rα. While initially thought of only as a stimulatory cytokine, IL-2 and IL-2Rα KO mice revealed that this cytokine-receptor system controls immune responses through restimulation-induced cell death and by promoting the survival of T regulatory cells. Although described mostly in the context of lymphocytes, recent studies by our laboratory showed that IL-2R is expressed in smooth muscle cells. Given this finding, we sought to use IL-2Rα KO to determine the function of this receptor in vascular smooth muscle cells. Surprisingly, we found that IL-2Rα KO vascular smooth muscle cells had detectable IL-2Rα. We used multiple gene and protein-based methods to determine why IL-2Rα KO vascular smooth muscle cells exhibited IL-2Rα protein. These methods included: genomic sequencing, assessing cells and tissues for evidence of maternal microchimerism, and determining the half-life of IL-2Rα protein. Our studies demonstrated the following: (1) in addition to the cell surface, IL-2Rα is localized to the nucleus; (2) the genetic deletion of IL-2Rα is intact in IL-2Rα KO mice; (3) both IL-2Rα KO and WT tissues show evidence of maternal microchimerism, the likely source of IL-2Rα (4) IL-2Rα is transmitted between cells; (5) IL-2Rα has a long half-life; and (6) nuclear IL-2Rα contributes to the regulation of cell proliferation and size. Our findings suggest that the phenotype of complete IL-2Rα loss is more severe than demonstrated by IL-2Rα KO mice, and that IL-2Rα plays a here-to-fore unrecognized role in regulating cell proliferation in non-lymphoid cells.",11133634
"Prenatal-onset androgen excess leads to abnormal sexual development in 46,XX individuals. This androgen excess can be caused endogenously by the adrenals or gonads or by exposure to exogenous androgens. The most common cause of 46,XX disorders/differences in sex development (DSD) is congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, comprising >90% of 46,XX DSD cases. Deficiencies of 11β-hydroxylase, 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, and P450-oxidoreductase (POR) are rare types of CAH, resulting in 46,XX DSD. In all CAH forms, patients have normal ovarian development. The molecular genetic causes of 46,XX DSD, besides CAH, are uncommon. These etiologies include primary glucocorticoid resistance (PGCR) and aromatase deficiency with normal ovarian development. Additionally, 46,XX gonads can differentiate into testes, causing 46,XX testicular (T) DSD or a coexistence of ovarian and testicular tissue, defined as 46,XX ovotesticular (OT)-DSD. PGCR is caused by inactivating variants in NR3C1, resulting in glucocorticoid insensitivity and the signs of mineralocorticoid and androgen excess. Pathogenic variants in the CYP19A1 gene lead to aromatase deficiency, causing androgen excess. Many genes are involved in the mechanisms of gonadal development, and genes associated with 46,XX T/OT-DSD include translocations of the SRY; copy number variants in NR2F2, NR0B1, SOX3, SOX9, SOX10, and FGF9, and sequence variants in NR5A1, NR2F2, RSPO1, SOX9, WNT2B, WNT4, and WT1. Progress in cytogenetic and molecular genetic techniques has significantly improved our understanding of the etiology of non-CAH 46,XX DSD. Nonetheless, uncertainties about gonadal function and gender outcomes may make the management of these conditions challenging. This review explores the intricate landscape of diagnosing and managing these conditions, shedding light on the unique aspects that distinguish them from other types of DSD.",11134272
"Uterine leiomyomas (ULM) are the most common benign tumors of the female genitalia, while uterine leiomyosarcomas (ULMS) are rare. The sarcoma is diffuse growth, prone to hematogenous metastasis, and has a poor prognosis. Due to their similar clinical symptoms and morphological features, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish them, and the final diagnosis depends on histological diagnosis. Misdiagnosis of ULM as ULMS will lead to more invasive and extensive surgery when it is not needed, while misdiagnosis of ULMS as ULM may lead to delayed treatment and poor prognosis. This review searched and studied the published articles on ULM and ULMS, and summarized the potential markers for the differential diagnosis of ULMS. These markers will facilitate differential diagnosis and personalized treatment, providing timely diagnosis and potentially better prognosis for patients.",11134592
"Paxillin is a ubiquitously expressed adaptor protein integral to focal adhesions, cell motility, and apoptosis. Paxillin has also recently been implicated as a mediator of nongenomic androgen receptor (AR) signaling in prostate cancer and other cells. We sought to investigate the relationship between paxillin and AR in granulosa cells (GCs), where androgen actions, apoptosis, and focal adhesions are of known importance, but where the role of paxillin is understudied. We recently showed that paxillin knockout in mouse GCs increases fertility in older mice. Here, we demonstrate that paxillin knockdown in human granulosa-derived KGN cells, as well as knockout in mouse primary GCs, results in reduced AR protein but not reduced mRNA expression. Further, we find that both AR protein and mRNA half-lives are reduced by approximately one-third in the absence of paxillin, but that cells adapt to chronic loss of paxillin by upregulating AR gene expression. Using co-immunofluorescence and proximity ligation assays, we show that paxillin and AR co-localize at the plasma membrane in GCs in a focal adhesion kinase-dependent way, and that disruption of focal adhesions leads to reduced AR protein level. Our findings suggest that paxillin recruits AR to the GC membrane, where it may be sequestered from proteasomal degradation and poised for nongenomic signaling, as reported in other tissues. To investigate the physiological significance of this in disorders of androgen excess, we tested the effect of GC-specific paxillin knockout in a mouse model of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) induced by chronic postnatal dihydrotestosterone (DHT) exposure. While none of the control mice had estrous cycles, 33% of paxillin knockout mice were cycling, indicating that paxillin deletion may offer partial protection from the negative effects of androgen excess by reducing AR expression. Paxillin-knockout GCs from mice with DHT-induced PCOS also produced more estradiol than GCs from littermate controls. Thus, paxillin may be a novel target in the management of androgen-related disorders in women, such as PCOS.",11136451
"Gene drive systems could be a viable strategy to prevent pathogen transmission or suppress vector populations by propagating drive alleles with super-Mendelian inheritance. CRISPR-based homing gene drives convert wild type alleles into drive alleles in heterozygotes with Cas9 and gRNA. It is thus desirable to identify Cas9 promoters that yield high drive conversion rates, minimize the formation rate of resistance alleles in both the germline and the early embryo, and limit somatic Cas9 expression. In Drosophila, the nanos promoter avoids leaky somatic expression, but at the cost of high embryo resistance from maternally deposited Cas9. To improve drive efficiency, we test eleven Drosophila melanogaster germline promoters. Some achieve higher drive conversion efficiency with minimal embryo resistance, but none completely avoid somatic expression. However, such somatic expression often does not carry detectable fitness costs for a rescue homing drive targeting a haplolethal gene, suggesting somatic drive conversion. Supporting a 4-gRNA suppression drive, one promoter leads to a low drive equilibrium frequency due to fitness costs from somatic expression, but the other outperforms nanos, resulting in successful suppression of the cage population. Overall, these Cas9 promoters hold advantages for homing drives in Drosophila species and may possess valuable homologs in other organisms.",11137117
"Hypothyroidism, characterized by reduced thyroid hormone levels, and endometrial cancer, a prevalent gynecological malignancy, have been suggested to have a potential association in previous observational studies. However, the causal relationship between them remains uncertain. This study aimed to investigate the causal relationship between hypothyroidism and endometrial cancer using a bilateral Mendelian randomization approach. A bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization study was conducted using summary statistics from genome-wide association studies to identify genetic variants associated with hypothyroidism and endometrial cancer. The inverse variance weighting method was used as the main analysis, and sensitivity analyses were conducted to validate the MR results. The results of our analysis did not support a causal effect of hypothyroidism (OR: 0.93, p=0.08) or autoimmune hypothyroidism (OR: 0.98, p=0.39) on endometrial cancer risk. In the reverse MR analysis, we did not find a significant causal effect of endometrial cancer on hypothyroidism (OR: 0.96, p=0.75) or autoimmune hypothyroidism (OR: 0.92, p=0.50). Based on subgroup analysis by pathological subtypes of endometrial cancer, the above findings were further substantiated (all p-value >0.05). Our Mendelian randomization analysis suggests a lack of causal association between hypothyroidism and endometrial cancer. To gain a deeper understanding of this association, it is essential to conduct large-scale randomized controlled trials in the future to validate our findings.",11137162
"Autosomal Recurrent Primary Microscopic (MCPH, OMIM: 251200) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is characterized by a noticeable decrease in brain size, particularly in the cerebral cortex, but with a normal brain structure and a non-progressive intellectual disability. MCPH1 has been identified as the gene that triggers primary microcephaly (MCPH1，OMIM: 607117). Here we report a case of autosomal recessive primary microcephaly as caused by a novel variant in the MCPH1 gene. Head circumference was measured by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), while the Wechsler Intelligence Scale was used to evaluate the intelligence of the individual being tested. B-ultrasound was used to assess gonadal development, and semen routine was used to assess sperm status. The whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed on the proband. Sanger sequencing was conducted on the parents of the proband to determine if the novel variant in the MCPH1 gene was present. The effect of the mutation on the splicing of MCPH1 was verified by minigene approach. It was observed that the proband had autosomal recessive primary microcephaly and azoospermatism. A novel splice-site homozygous mutation (c.233+2T > G) of the MCPH1 gene was identified, which inherited from his parents. Minigene approach confirmed that c.233+2T > G could affect the splicing of MCPH1. Therefore, our findings contributed to the mutation spectrum of the MCPH1 gene and may be useful in the diagnosis and gene therapy of MCPH.",11137353
"Introduction: Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare heterogeneous disease caused by abnormalities in motile cilia. In this case report, we first analyzed the clinical and genetic data of a proband who was suspected of having PCD on the basis of her clinical and radiological findings. Methods: Whole-exome sequencing was performed, and a variant in the RSPH4A gene was identified in the proband. Sanger sequencing was used for validation of RSPH4A variants in the proband, her sister, her daughter and her parents. Finally, the phenotypic features of the patient were analyzed, and the current literature was reviewed to better understand the gene variants in PCD related to hearing loss and the clinical manifestations of the RSPH4A variant in PCD. Results: The chief clinical symptoms of this proband included gradual mixed hearing loss, otitis media, anosmia, sinusitis, recurrent cough and infertility. Her DNA sequencing revealed a novel homozygous T to C transition at position 1321 within exon 3 of RSPH4A according to genetic testing results. This variant had never been reported before. The homozygous variant resulted in an amino acid substitution of tryptophan by arginine at position 441 (p.Trp441Arg). The same variant was also found in the proband’s sister, and a heterozygous pathogenic variant was identified among immediate family members, including the proband’s daughter and parents. Discussion: A literature review showed that 16 pathogenic variants in RSPH4A have been reported. Hearing loss had only been observed in patients with the RSPH4A (c.921+3_6delAAGT) splice site mutation, and the specific type of hearing loss was not described.",11137616
"The causes of infertility have remained an important challenge. The relationship between VDR gene polymorphisms and infertility has been reported, with controversial findings. We aimed to determine this relationship by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis. The study was started with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) declaration and the final draft was registered as a protocol in PROSPERO (ID: CRD42023416535). The international electronic databases including PubMed (Medline), Scopus, Web of Sciences, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINHAL) were searched until January 30, 2023, by using appropriate keywords. The quality of the final studies was assessed using the NOS Checklist for case–control studies. The odds ratios (ORs) for each of the genetic models were pooled, and a subgroup analysis based on geographical region and types of infertility was carried out by the MetaGenyo online tool. Case–control studies including 18 and 2 studies about infertility in women and men, respectively, and 4 miscarriage studies were entered into the meta-analysis. The VDR gene TaqI polymorphism was associated with infertility susceptibility in women in the allele contrast [OR = 1.2065, 95% CI (1.0846–1.3421); P = 0.0005], Recessive model [OR = 1.3836, 95% CI (1.1197–1.7096); P = 0.002], Dominant model [OR = 1.2146, 95% CI (0.0484–1.4072); P = 0.009], Homozygote [OR = 1.4596, 95% CI (1.1627–1.8325); P = 0.001], and TT vs. Tt [OR = 1.2853, 95% CI (1.0249–1.6117); P = 0.029. ApaI and FokI gene polymorphisms were found to be significantly protective SNPs against women and men infertility in the Dominant model [OR = 0.8379, 95% CI (0.7039- 0.9975); P = 0.046] and Recessive model [OR = 0.421, 95% CI (0.1821–0.9767); P = 0.043], respectively. Sub-group meta-analysis showed a protection association of ApaI in dominant [OR = 0.7738, 95% CI = 0.6249–0.9580; P = 0.018] and AA vs. aa [OR = 0.7404, 95 CI% (0.5860–0.9353) P = 0.011725] models in PCOS subgroup, however, a negative association with idiopathic infertility was found in AA vs. Aa [OR = 1.7063, 95% CI (1.1039–2.6375); P = 0.016187] and Aa vs. aa [OR = 0.6069, 95% CI (0.3761–0.9792); P = 0.040754]. TaqI SNP was significantly associated with infertility in the African population and BsmI was associated with the disease mostly in the Asian population. This meta-analysis showed that the TaqI polymorphism may be linked to women’s infertility susceptibility. However, ApaI and FokI might be the protective SNPs against infertility in Women and men, respectively.",11138068
"Over the past several decades, the use of biochemical and fluorescent tags has elucidated mechanistic and cytological processes that would otherwise be impossible. The challenging nature of certain nuclear proteins includes low abundancy, poor antibody recognition, and transient dynamics. One approach to get around those issues is the addition of a peptide or larger protein tag to the target protein to improve enrichment, purification, and visualization. However, many of these studies were done under the assumption that tagged proteins can fully recapitulate native protein function. We report that when C-terminally TAP-tagged CENP-A histone variant is introduced, it undergoes altered kinetochore protein binding, differs in post-translational modifications (PTMs), utilizes histone chaperones that differ from that of native CENP-A, and can partially displace native CENP-A in human cells. Additionally, these tagged CENP-A-containing nucleosomes have reduced centromeric incorporation at early G1 phase and poorly associates with linker histone H1.5 compared to native CENP-A nucleosomes. These data suggest expressing tagged versions of histone variant CENP-A may result in unexpected utilization of non-native pathways, thereby altering the biological function of the histone variant.
