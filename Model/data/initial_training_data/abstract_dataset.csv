Abstract,ID
"Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 have a high incidence of thrombosis that decreases after recovery. When coronavirus disease 2019 is accompanied by diseases prone to thrombosis, risk of post-infection thrombotic events may increase. We report a case of digital ischemic gangrene in a 24-year-old Chinese female with systemic lupus erythematosus after recovery from coronavirus disease 2019. The pathogenesis was related to clinical characteristics of systemic lupus erythematosus, hypercoagulability caused by coronavirus disease 2019, and second-hit due to viral infection. Patients with autoimmune diseases should remain alert to autoimmune system disorders induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and other viruses. Treatment for these patients should be strictly standardized, and appropriate anticoagulation methods should be selected to prevent thrombosis.",11186268
"The relationship between monetary loss and pain has been a recent research focus. Prior studies found similarities in the network representation patterns of monetary loss and pain, particularly social pain. However, the neural level evidence was lacking. To address this, we conducted an ERP experiment to investigate whether there is a repetitive suppression effect of monetary loss on the neural activity of social pain, aiming to understand if they engage overlapping neuronal populations. The results revealed that FRN amplitudes showed repetitive suppression effects of monetary loss on the neural activity of social pain. Our study suggests that monetary loss and social pain share common neural bases, indicating that they might involve shared neural modules related to cognitive conflict and affective appraisal.

"The exploration of cancer vaccines has yielded a multitude of studies, resulting in a diverse collection of information. The heterogeneity of cancer vaccine data significantly impedes effective integration and analysis. While CanVaxKB serves as a pioneering database for over 670 manually annotated cancer vaccines, it is important to distinguish that a database, on its own, does not offer the structured relationships and standardized definitions found in an ontology. Recognizing this, we expanded the Vaccine Ontology (VO) to include those cancer vaccines present in CanVaxKB that were not initially covered, enhancing VO’s capacity to systematically define and interrelate cancer vaccines. An ontology design pattern (ODP) was first developed and applied to semantically represent various cancer vaccines, capturing their associated entities and relations. By applying the ODP, we generated a cancer vaccine template in a tabular format and converted it into the RDF/OWL format for generation of cancer vaccine terms in the VO. ‘12MP vaccine’ was used as an example of cancer vaccines to demonstrate the application of the ODP. VO also reuses reference ontology terms to represent entities such as cancer diseases and vaccine hosts. Description Logic (DL) and SPARQL query scripts were developed and used to query for cancer vaccines based on different vaccine’s features and to demonstrate the versatility of the VO representation. Additionally, ontological modeling was applied to illustrate cancer vaccine related concepts and studies for in-depth cancer vaccine analysis. A cancer vaccine-specific VO view, referred to as “CVO,” was generated, and it contains 928 classes including 704 cancer vaccines. The CVO OWL file is publicly available on: http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/vo/cvo.owl, for sharing and applications. To facilitate the standardization, integration, and analysis of cancer vaccine data, we expanded the Vaccine Ontology (VO) to systematically model and represent cancer vaccines. We also developed a pipeline to automate the inclusion of cancer vaccines and associated terms in the VO. This not only enriches the data’s standardization and integration, but also leverages ontological modeling to deepen the analysis of cancer vaccine information, maximizing benefits for researchers and clinicians.

"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) represents a highly aggressive subset of breast malignancies characterized by its challenging clinical management and unfavorable prognosis. While TFAP2A, a member of the AP-2 transcription factor family, has been implicated in maintaining the basal phenotype of breast cancer, its precise regulatory role in TNBC remains undefined. In vitro assessments of TNBC cell growth and migratory potential were conducted using MTS, colony formation, and EdU assays. Quantitative PCR was employed to analyze mRNA expression levels, while Western blot was utilized to evaluate protein expression and phosphorylation status of AKT and ERK. The post-transcriptional regulation of TFAP2A by miR-8072 and the transcriptional activation of SNAI1 by TFAP2A were investigated through luciferase reporter assays. A xenograft mouse model was employed to assess the in vivo growth capacity of TNBC cells. Selective silencing of TFAP2A significantly impeded the proliferation and migration of TNBC cells, with elevated TFAP2A expression observed in breast cancer tissues. Notably, TNBC patients exhibiting heightened TFAP2A levels experienced abbreviated overall survival. Mechanistically, TFAP2A was identified as a transcriptional activator of SNAI1, a crucial regulator of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cellular proliferation, thereby augmenting the oncogenic properties of TFAP2A in TNBC. Moreover, miR-8072 was unveiled as a negative regulator of TFAP2A, exerting potent inhibitory effects on TNBC cell growth and migration. Importantly, the tumor-suppressive actions mediated by the miR-8072/TFAP2A axis were intricately associated with the attenuation of AKT/ERK signaling cascades and the blockade of EMT processes. Our findings unravel the role and underlying molecular mechanism of TFAP2A in driving tumorigenesis of TNBC. Targeting the TFAP2A/SNAI1 pathway and utilizing miR-8072 as a suppressor represent promising therapeutic strategies for treating TNBC.

"The escalating prevalence of diabetes, with its multifaceted complications, poses a pressing challenge for healthcare systems globally. In response, the advent of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems, offering technological solutions for daily diabetes management, presents significant opportunities. However, the widespread adoption faces several barriers, linked both to the technological configuration of the devices and to the psychological dimension of patients. Therefore, this study aims to apply and test a theoretical model that investigates the antecedents of the intention to use Continuous Glucose Monitoring systems. The research model was built to unveil the impacts of psychological factors, functional components and rational constructs derived from the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) on CGM systems sustained adoption. To ensure the comparability of results, we have collected data from people who had used Dexcom ONE Dexcom (San Diego, CA) for the first time for at least one month. Employing Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) techniques, the hypothesized relationships among constructs were assessed. The analyses confirmed the positive correlation of rational factors to the Intention to Use. Subjective Norm, intended as the physicians’ influence, is positively correlated with the Perceived Usefulness. Trend Arrows, albeit being negatively correlated with Perceived Usefulness, have a positive correlation on Perceived Ease Of Use, reinforcing its mediating effect towards Perceived Usefulness. Among psychological factors, Trust in the CGM technology positively correlates with Intention to Use. Health Literacy is negatively correlated to the Intention to Use. These findings contribute to theoretical and managerial understanding, providing recommendations to enhance the adoption of CGM systems like Dexcom ONE.

"The quality of maize kernels is significantly enhanced by amino acids, which are the fundamental building blocks of proteins. Meanwhile, calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg), as important nutrients for maize growth, are vital in regulating the metabolic pathways and enzyme activities of amino acid synthesis. Therefore, our study analyzed the response process and changes of amino acid content, endogenous hormone content, and antioxidant enzyme activity in kernels to the coupling addition of sugar alcohol-chelated Ca and Mg fertilizers with spraying on maize. (1) The coupled addition of Ca and Mg fertilizers increased the Ca and Mg content, endogenous hormone components (indole-3-acetic acid, IAA; gibberellin, GA; zeatin riboside, ZR) content, antioxidant enzyme activity, and amino acid content of maize kernels. The content of Ca and Mg in kernels increased with the increasing levels of Ca and Mg fertilizers within a certain range from the filling to the wax ripening stage, and significantly positively correlated with antioxidant enzyme activities. (2) The contents of IAA, GA, and ZR continued to rise, and the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) were elevated, which effectively enhanced the ability of cells to resist oxidative damage, promoted cell elongation and division, and facilitated the growth and development of maize. However, the malondialdehyde (MDA) content increased consistently, which would attack the defense system of the cell membrane plasma to some extent. (3) Leucine (LEU) exhibited the highest percentage of essential amino acid components and a gradual decline from the filling to the wax ripening stage, with the most substantial beneficial effect on essential amino acids. (4) CAT and SOD favorably governed essential amino acids, while IAA and MDA negatively regulated them. The dominant physiological driving pathway for the synthesis of essential amino acids was “IAA-CAT-LEU”, in which IAA first negatively drove CAT activity, and CAT then advantageously controlled LEU synthesis. These findings provide a potential approach to the physiological and biochemical metabolism of amino acid synthesis, and the nutritional quality enhancement of maize kernel.",11186291
"Chemoresistance remains a significant challenge for effective breast cancer treatment which leads to cancer recurrence. CRISPR-directed gene editing becomes a powerful tool to reduce chemoresistance by reprogramming the tumor microenvironment. Previous research has revealed that Chinese herbal extracts have significant potential to overcome tumor chemoresistance. However, the therapeutic efficacy is often limited due to their poor tumor targeting and in vivo durability. Here we have developed a tumor microenvironment responsive nanoplatform (H-MnO2(ISL + DOX)-PTPN2@HA, M(I + D)PH) for nano-herb and CRISPR codelivery to reduce chemoresistance. Synergistic tumor inhibitory effects were achieved by the treatment of isoliquiritigenin (ISL) with doxorubicin (DOX), which were enhanced by CRISPR-based gene editing to target protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 2 (PTPN2) to initiate long-term immunotherapy. Efficient PTPN2 depletion was observed after treatment with M(I + D)PH nanoparticles, which resulted in the recruitment of intratumoral infiltrating lymphocytes and an increase of proinflammatory cytokines in the tumor tissue. Overall, our nanoparticle platform provides a diverse technique for accomplishing synergistic chemotherapy and immunotherapy, which offers an effective treatment alternative for malignant neoplasms.

"Background: This study examined the time to sputum smear and culture conversion and determinants of conversion, as well as variables associated with treatment outcomes among drug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis (DR-PTB) cases. Methods: The electronic database and written medical records of patients were utilized to assess the sociodemographic, clinical, microbiological, and treatment characteristics and outcomes of study participants. Results: Among 736 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB), the mean age was 36.5 ± 16.5 years, with males comprising 53.4% and a mean weight of 47.76 ± 11.97 kg. The median time period for sputum smear conversion and sputum culture conversion was a month. The first-month culture conversion (p < 0.001, aOR = 5.817, and 95% CI = 3.703–9.138) was the determinant of sputum smear conversion and receiver operating curve analysis with AUC = 0.881, 95% CI = 0.855–0.907, and p < 0.001, which showed a high level of predictive ability for the regression model for the initial sputum smear conversion. However, the first-month sputum conversion (p < 0.001, aOR = 7.446, and 95% CI = 4.869–11.388) was attributed to sputum culture conversion, and the model has shown excellent predictive ability for regression with ROC curve analysis demonstrating AUC = 0.862, 95% CI = 0.835–0.889, and p < 0.001. A total of 63.2% of patients showed favorable treatment outcomes, with 63.1% of cases achieving treatment-cured status. The previous use of SLD, history of smoking, duration of illness ≤ 1 year, extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis, and first-month sputum conversion were the variables attributed to favorable treatment outcomes observed in drug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis cases. ROC curve analysis with AUC = 0.902, 95% CI = 0.877–0.927, and p < 0.001) has shown outstanding ability for regression model prediction for the variables influencing treatment outcomes. Conclusions: Within 2 months of treatment, most patients had converted their sputum cultures and sputum smears. The determinants of early sputum smear and sputum culture conversion, as well as favorable treatment outcomes, were identified. These factors should be considered during the design and implementation of effective strategies for drug-resistant tuberculosis control programs.",11186297
"The sequelae of pelvic inflammatory disease (SPID) are major causes of secondary infertility. Modified Hongteng Baijiang decoction (MHTBD) has produced positive results in the treatment of patients with chronic pelvic inflammatory disease; however, its role in SPID remains elusive. Therefore, this study clarified the role of MHTBD in SPID pathogenesis. The main components in MHTBD were analyzed by using liquid chromatography‒mass spectrometry (LC/MS). An SPID rat model was established, and the rats were treated with different doses of MHTBD (0.504 g of raw drug/kg, 1.008 g of raw drug/kg, and 2.016 g of raw drug/kg). Endometrial pinopodes were observed via scanning electron microscopy, endometrial thickness and inflammatory cell infiltration were assessed via HE staining, and the expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), integrin β3 (ITGB3), and CD31 in the endometrium was detected by using immunohistochemistry. Western blot analysis was used to detect the protein expression of LIF, JAK2, p‐JAK2, STAT3, and p‐STAT3 in the endometrium. Moreover, the changes in the gut microbiota were analyzed via 16S rRNA sequencing. MHTBD improved endometrial receptivity, attenuated endometrial pathologic damage, reduced inflammatory cell infiltration, decreased ER and PR expression in the endometrium, and promoted the expression of LIF, p‐JAK2, and p‐STAT3 in the endometrium (p < .05) in SPID rats. Additionally, MHTBD treatment affected the composition of the gut microbiota in SPID rats. Furthermore, MHTBD attenuated endometrial receptivity and pathological damage in SPID rats by promoting the LIF/JAK2/STAT3 pathway. MHTBD attenuates SPID in rats by promoting the LIF/JAK2/STAT3 pathway and improving the composition of the gut microbiota. MHTBD may be a valuable drug for SPID therapy.",11186298
"Emerging research suggests an association between psychological distress and e-cigarette use. However, our understanding of young adults’ experiences of this relationship is limited. We explored young adults’ experiences of psychological distress and e-cigarette use. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 18- to 24-year-old university students (n=13; 77% female; mean age=21.5 years) based in Victoria, Australia. Interviews were conducted May–June 2023. Data were subject to reflexive thematic analysis. Individuals reported that they or their friends had initiated e-cigarette use to manage their psychological distress (e.g. low mood, social isolation, stress). Immediate stress reduction following use and subsequent nicotine dependence appeared to maintain use. A reciprocal relationship likely exists between psychological distress and e-cigarette use whereby psychological distress contributes to use initiation and use maintains distress. Public campaigns and health services should provide: 1) education on adaptive coping/stress management strategies and the signs of nicotine dependence, and 2) support to manage nicotine dependence and the psychological distress that can arise from addiction.",11186307
"Equid herpesvirus type 8 (EqHV-8) poses a significant threat to equine health, leading to miscarriages and respiratory diseases in horses and donkeys, and results in substantial economic losses in the donkey industry. Currently, there are no effective drugs or vaccines available for EqHV-8 infection control. In this study, we investigated the in vitro and in vivo antiviral efficacy of Blebbistatin, a myosin II ATPase inhibitor, against EqHV-8. Our results demonstrated that Blebbistatin significantly inhibited EqHV-8 infection in Rabbit kidney (RK-13) and Madin-Darby Bovine Kidney (MDBK) cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Notably, Blebbistatin was found to disrupt EqHV-8 infection at the entry stage by modulating myosin II ATPase activity. Moreover, in vivo experiments revealed that Blebbistatin effectively reduced EqHV-8 replication and mitigated lung pathology in a mouse model. Collectively, these findings suggest that Blebbistatin holds considerable potential as an antiviral agent for the control of EqHV-8 infection, presenting a novel approach to addressing this veterinary challenge.",11186319
"Multilayered scaffolds mimicking mechanical and biological host tissue architectures are the current prerequisites for successful tissue regeneration. We propose our tunable tri-layered scaffold, designed to represent the native periodontium for potential regenerative applications. The fused deposition modeling platform is used to fabricate the novel movable three-layered polylactic acid scaffold mimicking in vivo cementum, periodontal ligament, and alveolar bone layers. The scaffold is further provided with multiple angulated fibers, offering directional guidance and facilitating the anchorage dependence on cell adhesion. Additionally, surface modifications of the scaffold were made by incorporating coatings like collagen and different concentrations of gelatin methacryloyl to enrich the cell adhesion and proliferation. The surface characterization of our designed scaffolds was performed using tribological studies, atomic force microscopy, contact angle measurement, scanning electron microscopy, and micro-computed tomography. Furthermore, the material characterization of this scaffold was investigated by attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy. The scaffold's mechanical characterization, such as strength and compression modulus, was demonstrated by compression testing. The L929 mouse fibroblast cells and MG63 human osteosarcoma cells have been cultured on the scaffold. The scaffold's superior biocompatibility was evaluated using fluorescence dye with fluorescence microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, in vitro wound healing assay, MTT assay, and flow cytometry. The mineralization capability of the scaffolds was also studied. In conclusion, our study demonstrated the construction of a multilayered movable scaffold, which is highly biocompatible and most suitable for various downstream applications such as periodontium and in situ tissue regeneration of complex, multilayered tissues.",11186324
"This study investigates the intricate relationship between parents’ education anxiety and children’s learning anxiety, examining the mediating role of parenting style and the moderating effect of extracurricular tutoring. Utilizing data from the “Survey of Parents and Students in Primary and Secondary Schools,” the study employs stratified sampling (n = 3,298) and various psychological scales to measure education anxiety, parenting styles, and extracurricular tutoring. This study reveals that parents’ education anxiety significantly influences children’s learning anxiety, with a notable positive correlation (r = 0.301**). Parenting styles particularly rejection and overprotection style increase this anxiety, while emotional warmth style decreases it. Academic tutoring serves as a moderator, reducing the impact of parental anxiety on children’s learning anxiety (β = −0.033, p < 0.05). The study underscores the importance of addressing internal family dynamics to alleviate education anxiety. It advocates for a balanced approach to tutoring, emphasizing the benefits of arts and sports activities in reducing learning anxiety. Parents should be encouraged to adopt emotionally warm parenting styles and to engage their children in a variety of extracurricular activities.",11186339
"To investigate the application value of complete laparoscopy and Da Vinci robot esophagogastric anastomosis double muscle flap plasty in radical resection of proximal gastric cancer. A retrospective descriptive study was used. The clinicopathological data of 35 patients undergoing radical operation for proximal gastric cancer admitted to Liaoning Cancer Hospital from January 2020 to December 2023 were collected. Variables evaluated: 1. Transoperative,2. Postoperative, 3. Follow-up. In relation to follow-up, esophageal disease status reflux, anastomosis, nutritional status score, serum hemoglobin, tumor recurrence, and metastasis were investigated. The trans and postoperative variables were obtained from the clinical records and the patients were followed up in outpatient department and by telephone. Among the 35 patients, 17 underwent robotic surgery and 18 underwent laparoscopic surgery. There were 29 males and 6 females. 1) Transoperative: Robotic surgery: The operation time was (305.59 ± 22.07) min, the esophagogastric anastomosis double muscle flap plasty time was (149.76 ± 14.91) min, the average number of lymph nodes cleared was 30, and the average intraoperative blood loss was 30 ml. Laparoscopic surgery: The mean operation time was 305.17 ± 26.92min, the operation time of esophagogastric anastomosis double muscle flap was (194.06 ± 22.52) min, the average number of lymph nodes cleared was 24, and the average intraoperative blood loss was 52.5 ml. 2) Postoperative: Robotic surgery: the average time for patients to have their first postoperative anal emission was 3 days, the average time to first postoperative feeding was 4 days, and the average length of hospitalization after surgery was 8 days. Laparoscopic surgery: the average time for patients to have their first postoperative anal emission was 5 days, the average time to first postoperative feeding was 6 days, the average length of hospitalization after surgery was 10 days. 3) Follow-up: The follow-up time ranged from 1 to 42 months, with a median follow-up time of 24 months. Complete Da Vinci robot and laparoscopic esophagogastric anastomosis double muscle flap plasty for radical resection of proximal gastric cancer can minimize surgical incision, reduce abdominal exposure, accelerate postoperative recovery of patients, and effectively prevent reflux esophagitis and maintain good hemoglobin concentration and nutritional status. The advantages of robotic surgery is less intraoperative bleeding and faster post-surgical recovery, but it is relatively more expensive.",11186349
"While bone metastases (BMs) are present in a minority of thyroid cancer (TC) patients at the time of initial diagnosis, there has been growing concern regarding their impact on life expectancy and quality of life. The aim of this study was to identify prognostic factors associated with overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) in these patients and provide therapeutic recommendations based on the findings. In this retrospective cohort study, we included 82 patients diagnosed as TC with BM received treatment in our department from 2011.03 to 2023.03 (average follow-up duration was 3.02 years). The retrospective study was performed according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate the OS and CSS, while the univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models were employed to determine prognostic factors associated with OS and CSS. Also, 287 patients’ data were collected from the National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database between 2010 and 2015 to confirm the prognostic factors identified in the retrospective study. The average survival time of the 82 patients was estimated to be 5.818 years (with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 4.767 to 6.868 years). The cox regression analysis showed that older age (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.045, 95% CI: 1.001-1.092, P = 0.047), larger tumor size (>5cm, HR = 11.087, 95% CI: 3.728 - 32.976, P = 0.000), and the presence of extraosseous metastasis (HR = 3.247, 95% CI: 1.376 - 7.665, P = 0.007) were statistically significant factors associated with worse CSS. The results were furtherly confirmed in 287 SEER-sourced patients (age (HR = 1.020, 95% CI: 1.006 - 1.034, P = 0.006), tumor size (HR = 2.917, 95% CI: 2.044 - 4.161, P = 0.000), and extraosseous metastasis (HR = 3.726, 95% CI: 2.571 - 5.398, P = 0.000)). These results offer a population-based assessment of prognostic factors for patients with TC and BMs, revealing that age, primary tumor size (>5cm), and presence of extraosseous metastases are independent prognostic factors that correlate with worse survival. Accordingly, treatment for such patients ought to concentrate on systemic integrative therapy instead of surgical intervention.",11186379
"The aim of our study was to measure fecal glucocorticoid metabolite (FGM) concentrations in captive and free-ranging male and female mountain gazelles (Gazella gazella) during their circannual cycle. In addition, FGM concentrations were used to track the intensity of the adrenocortical response in mountain gazelles during the same period. Fecal samples were collected from the ground in the Hatay Mountain Gazelle Wildlife Development Area in the Hatay Province of Türkiye (36°32’ N, 36°32′ E) in each season of the year (December, April, July, September). The sex of the animals was determined by detecting the SRY gene of the Y chromosome in DNA isolated from the fecal samples. FGM was extracted from dried fecal samples with methanol, and its concentration was measured using a previously partially validated ELISA. The results indicate that season is the most important factor explaining the variability in FGM concentrations in mountain gazelles. In animals of both sexes, the highest concentrations of FGM were observed in September. The values were significantly higher in the captive population, perhaps due to unpredictable stress. In July, FGM concentrations were low in both populations. As a result of the overall analysis across seasons, the comparison of FGM concentrations between captive and free-ranging animals revealed higher concentrations in captive animals only in September but not in other seasons, although higher concentrations have been previously reported for several wild captive species. Due to predation risk, the presence of offspring can be considered a critical point in the biological cycle for the welfare of free-ranging mountain gazelles, as suggested by the higher FGM concentrations in the free-ranging population in July. The high number of visitors could be a challenge for mountain gazelles in captivity, as indicated by higher FGM concentrations during September. Sex had no effect on the FGM concentrations of either population.",11186381
"Duodenal neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), comprising 2–3% of all gastrointestinal NETs and 1–3% of all duodenal tumors, are remarkably uncommon. In this report, we described a patient diagnosed with two submucosal tumors in the duodenal bulb. We used two distinct endoscopic resection methods, including endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) and submucosal tunneling endoscopic resection (STER), to achieve en bloc resection of the lesions without complications. Pathological evaluation, involving hematoxylin–eosin staining and immunohistochemistry, confirmed the diagnosis of NET. Given the limited operative field and space in the duodenal bulb, STER proved to be a viable endoscopic resection technique.",11186382
"The use of tailored language, which involves a clinician’s ability to adapt communication styles and employ accessible terms and concepts, has long been touted as key to engaging men with mental health services. Metaphors are one communication device that can provide men with ways through which to meaningfully express themselves and communicate their mental distress experiences. Using qualitative photovoice research, the current study examined how New Zealand-based men (n = 21) communicatively constructed their meaning of mental distress through metaphors. Analysis of interview data was used to derive three metaphor groupings men consistently drew on to articulate their lived experiences: metaphors of emotions (darkness and weight), metaphors of survival (battle and entity), and metaphors of disembodiments (debility and entrapment). The findings highlight the power of metaphors as a tool for men in communicating their experiences of mental distress and are valuable for health professionals to contemplate across an array of contexts. The implications and importance of a metaphor-enriched perspective for engaging men in professional health care settings and services are discussed.",11186386
"Syntaxin-binding protein 1 related disorder (STXBP1-RD) is a rare neurologic disorder associated with global neurodevelopmental delay, intellectual disability, early-onset epilepsy, motor abnormalities, and autism. The underlying pathophysiology stems from a de novo mutation in the STXBP1 gene, which codes for the STXBP1 protein. The STXBP1 protein is involved in synaptic vesicle fusion and neurotransmitter release. Pathogenic variants in the STXBP1 gene generally result in haploinsufficiency, an impairment in neurotransmitter release, and subsequent dysfunction in neuronal communication. The STXBP1 Foundation was founded in 2017 to support families of children with STXBP1-RD and accelerate the development of effective therapies and, ultimately, a cure for the disorder. The Foundation initially supported research aimed at better understanding the complex phenotypic presentation of the disease as well as the development of animal and cellular models usable by the research community to more fully characterize STXBP1 function and disease pathogenicity. In 2023, the Foundation embarked on its STXBP1 Fast Forward Strategic Plan, which includes a prospective natural history study and substantive biomarker work to drive forward the development of new precision therapies for STXBP1-RD.",11186390
"Mandating headgear for field players in girls’ lacrosse to reduce head injuries, including concussion, has been heavily debated. However, research regarding the need and effectiveness of mandated headgear use in girls’ lacrosse is still developing. Therefore, this qualitative study aimed to identify the need for and barriers to the development of mandated headgear use policies in girls’ lacrosse in Ohio. We conducted six virtual focus groups, three with concussion experts (clinicians and researchers) and three with girls’ lacrosse stakeholders (high school players, parents, coaches, and officials). A focus group guide was developed to explore study participants’ perceptions and opinions on concussion in girls’ lacrosse, headgear use among players, and policies and policy development related to headgear use or a headgear mandate. We developed the codebook using an inductive and iterative approach based on focus group transcripts and used ATLAS.TI to code and analyze the transcript data. Concussion experts and stakeholders understood the potential consequences of concussion but did not perceive concussion as a pervasive problem in girls’ lacrosse. The prevention of head and facial injuries was regarded as a potential benefit of headgear use. However, stakeholders expressed that the myriad of arguments discussed opposing mandated headgear use including increased aggressive play and/or targeting, concerns over changes in the game, and cost strongly outweighed the benefits. Finally, both concussion experts and stakeholders identified multiple organizations, including USA Lacrosse, who could act as facilitators and/or barriers to developing, enacting, and implementing headgear policies. Concussion experts and stakeholders identified possible reasons for headgear use related to injury prevention but also identified several important barriers to the development of a headgear mandate for girls’ lacrosse in Ohio.",11186391
"Chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA) is a challenging respiratory infection caused by the environmental fungus Aspergillus. CPA has a poor prognosis, with reported 1-year mortality rates ranging from 7% to 32% and 5-year mortality rates ranging from 38% to 52%. A comprehensive understanding of the pathogen, pathophysiology, risk factors, diagnosis, surgery, hemoptysis treatment, pharmacological therapy, and prognosis is essential to manage CPA effectively. In particular, Aspergillus drug resistance and cryptic species pose significant challenges. CPA lacks tissue invasion and has specific features such as aspergilloma. The most critical risk factor for the development of CPA is pulmonary cavitation. Diagnostic approaches vary by CPA subtype, with computed tomography (CT) imaging and Aspergillus IgG antibodies being key. Treatment strategies include surgery, hemoptysis management, and antifungal therapy. Surgery is the curative option. However, reported postoperative mortality rates range from 0% to 5% and complications range from 11% to 63%. Simple aspergilloma generally has a low postoperative mortality rate, making surgery the first choice. Hemoptysis, observed in 50% of CPA patients, is a significant symptom and can be life-threatening. Bronchial artery embolization achieves hemostasis in 64% to 100% of cases, but 50% experience recurrent hemoptysis. The efficacy of antifungal therapy for CPA varies, with itraconazole reported to be 43–76%, voriconazole 32–80%, posaconazole 44–61%, isavuconazole 82.7%, echinocandins 42–77%, and liposomal amphotericin B 52–73%. Combinatorial treatments such as bronchoscopic triazole administration, inhalation, or direct injection of amphotericin B at the site of infection also show efficacy. A treatment duration of more than 6 months is recommended, with better efficacy reported for periods of more than 1 year. In anticipation of improvements in CPA management, ongoing advances in basic and clinical research are expected to contribute to the future of CPA management.",11186400
"To date, the definition that the off-label usage of drugs refers to the unapproved use of approved drugs, which covers unapproved indications, patient populations, doses, and/or routes of administration, has been in existence for many years. Currently, there is a limited frequency and prevalence of research on the off-label use of antineoplastic drugs, mainly due to incomplete definition and classification issues. It is time to embrace new categories for the off-label usage of anticancer drugs. This review provided an insight into an updated overview of the concept and categories of the off-label use of anticancer drugs, along with illustrating specific examples to establish the next studies about the extent of the off-label usage of anticancer drugs in the oncology setting. The scope of the off-label use of current anticancer drugs beyond the previous definitions not only includes off-label uses in terms of indications, patient populations, doses, and/or routes of administration but also off-label use in terms of medication course, combination, sequence of medication, clinical purpose, contraindications scenarios, etc. In addition, the definition of the off-label usage of anticancer drugs should be added to the condition at a given time, and it varies from approval authorities. We presented a new and relatively comprehensive classification, providing extensive analysis and illustrative examples of the off-label usage of antineoplastic drugs for the first time. Such a classification has the potential to promote practical adoption and enhance management strategies for the off-label use of antitumor drugs.",11186405
"The article shows that the input given by healthcare professionals (HCPs) adds value to the regulatory processes surrounding the development, authorisation, and monitoring of a medicine, but is also an instrument for accountability, trust, mutual exchange as well as an insight into the public health issues that matter most to one of the key stakeholder groups the Agency works with. We highlight the role of HCPs in the EU regulatory process and take stock of the first 10 years of the Framework for Interaction with HCPs to describe how practises have evolved over this time to meet the goals of informing, consulting and improving trust in the EU regulatory system. We will analyse what led European Medicines Agency (EMA) to develop this framework through to the next steps and where the interaction might lead in the future.",11186408
"American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) communities are more likely to suffer negative consequences related to substance misuse. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated the opioid poisoning crisis, in combination with ongoing treatment barriers resulting from settler-colonialism, systemic oppression and racial discrimination. AI/AN adults are at greatest risk of COVID-19 related serious illness and death. In collaboration with an Indigenous community advisory board and Tribal leadership, this study explored AI/AN treatment provider perceptions of client-relatives’ (i.e., SUD treatment recipients) experiences during the pandemic from 2020 to 2022. Providers who underwent screening and were eligible to participate (N = 25) represented 6 programs and organizations serving rural and urban areas in Washington, Utah, and Minnesota. Participants engaged in audio-recorded 60–90 min semi-structured individual interviews conducted virtually via Zoom. The interview guide included 15 questions covering regulatory changes, guidance for telemedicine, policy and procedures, staff communication, and client-relatives’ reactions to implemented changes, service utilization, changes in treatment modality, and perceptions of impact on their roles and practice. Interview recordings were transcribed and de-identified. Members of the research team independently reviewed transcripts before reaching consensus. Coding was completed in Dedoose, followed by analyses informed by a qualitative descriptive approach. Five main domains were identified related to client-relative experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic, as observed by providers: (1) accessibility, (2) co-occurring mental health, (3) social determinants of health, (4) substance use, coping, and harm reduction strategies, and (5) community strengths. Providers reported the distinctive experiences of AI/AN communities, highlighting the impact on client-relatives, who faced challenges such as reduced income, heightened grief and loss, and elevated rates of substance use and opioid-related poisonings. Community and culturally informed programming promoting resilience and healing are outlined. Findings underscore the impact on SUD among AI/AN communities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Identifying treatment barriers and mental health impacts on client-relatives during a global pandemic can inform ongoing and future culturally responsive SUD prevention and treatment strategies. Elevating collective voice to strengthen Indigenous informed systems of care to address the gap in culturally-and community-based services, can bolster holistic approaches and long-term service needs to promote SUD prevention efforts beyond emergency response efforts.",11186410
"Excessive internet and mobile cell phone use has been increasing in recent years especially in teenagers who are a vulnerable population. However, there is a lack of psychometric evaluation of instruments that allow to identify behavior regarding problematic use of the internet and cell phones in the Latin America, particularly in Ecuador. The main aim of this study is to examine the psychometric properties of two instruments: the Internet-related experiences questionnaire (IREQ) and Mobile-related experiences questionnaire (MREQ) in high school students (n = 4, 174, Mage = 15.63; 51.19% male and 48.37% female). The validation process was performed using one and two factors for both questionnaires according to previous literature. After checking the models proposed to date, the best fit model was the one-factor model for (IREQ) and one-factor model for (MREQ). The invariance was performed using two samples according to gender (male, female) and has been confirmed with an acceptable internal consistency for both questionnaires. For IREQ (All, ω = 0.80; Male, ω = 0.77; Female, ω = 0.82) and for MREQ (All, ω = 0.83; Male, ω = 0.82; Female, ω = 0.84). In addition, we performed the correlation analysis between IREQ, MREQ, and socio-demographic variables and finally, both instruments demonstrated strong psychometric qualities within the local population.",11186412
"Frequency distributions are known to widely affect psycholinguistic processes. The effects of word frequency in turns-at-talk, the nucleus of social action in conversation, have, by contrast, been largely neglected. This study probes into this gap by applying corpus-linguistic methods on the conversational component of the British National Corpus (BNC) and the Freiburg Multimodal Interaction Corpus (FreMIC). The latter includes continuous pupil size measures of participants of the recorded conversations, allowing for a systematic investigation of patterns in the contained speech and language on the one hand and their relation to concurrent processing costs they may incur in speakers and recipients on the other hand. We test a first hypothesis in this vein, analyzing whether word frequency distributions within turns-at-talk are correlated with interlocutors' processing effort during the production and reception of these turns. Turns are found to generally show a regular distribution pattern of word frequency, with highly frequent words in turn-initial positions, mid-range frequency words in turn-medial positions, and low-frequency words in turn-final positions. Speakers' pupil size is found to tend to increase during the course of a turn at talk, reaching a climax toward the turn end. Notably, the observed decrease in word frequency within turns is inversely correlated with the observed increase in pupil size in speakers, but not in recipients, with steeper decreases in word frequency going along with steeper increases in pupil size in speakers. We discuss the implications of these findings for theories of speech processing, turn structure, and information packaging. Crucially, we propose that the intensification of processing effort in speakers during a turn at talk is owed to an informational climax, which entails a progression from high-frequency, low-information words through intermediate levels to low-frequency, high-information words. At least in English conversation, interlocutors seem to make use of this pattern as one way to achieve efficiency in conversational interaction, creating a regularly recurring distribution of processing load across speaking turns, which aids smooth turn transitions, content prediction, and effective information transfer.",11186443
"Introduction: Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients face challenges due to limited treatment options. About 50% of patients with mCRPC have a functional loss of phosphatase and tensin homology deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), leading to tumor progression, metastasis, and immune suppression. Moreover, elevated IL-23 produced by myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) is found in CRPC patients, driving tumor progression. Therefore, a combination strategy based on PTEN restoration and IL-23 inhibition may block CRPC progression and metastasis. Methods: The antitumor effect of restoring PTEN expression combined with the IL-23 inhibitor Apilimod was studied in a mouse model of bone metastasis CRPC and mouse prostate cancer RM-1 cells. To verify the targeting ability of PTEN DNA coated with lipid nanoparticles (LNP@PTEN) in vitro and in vivo. In addition, RT-qPCR and flow cytometry were used to investigate the related mechanisms of the antitumor effect of LNP@PTEN combined with Apilimod. Results: LNPs exhibited significant tumor-targeting and tumor accumulation capabilities both in vitro and in vivo, enhancing PTEN expression and therapeutic efficacy. Additionally, the combination of LNP@PTEN with the IL-23 inhibitor Apilimod demonstrated enhanced inhibition of tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis (particularly secondary organ metastasis) compared to other groups, and extended the survival of mice to 41 days, providing a degree of bone protection. These effects may be attributed to the PTEN function restoration combined with IL-23 inhibition, which help reverse immune suppression in the tumor microenvironment by reducing MDSCs recruitment and increasing the CD8+/CD4+ T cell ratio. Discussion: In summary, these findings highlight the potential of LNPs for delivering gene therapeutic agents. And the combination of LNP@PTEN with Apilimod could achieve anti-tumor effects and improve tumor microenvironment. This combinational strategy opens new avenues for the treatment of mCRPC.",11186457
"With the growing global population and climate change, achieving food security is a pressing challenge. Vertical farming has the potential to support local food production and security. As a Total Controlled Environment Agriculture (TCEA) system, vertical farming employs LED lighting which offers opportunities to modulate light spectrum and intensity, and thus can be used to influence plant growth and phytochemical composition, including antioxidants beneficial for human health. In this study, we investigated the effect of four red-to-blue light ratios of LEDs (R:B 1, 2.5, 5 and 9) on the growth and antioxidant components in red amaranth microgreens and red lettuce. Plant growth, total phenols, betalains, anthocyanins, vitamin C and antioxidant capacity (ferric reducing antioxidant power assay) were evaluated. A higher proportion of red light resulted in biometric responses, i.e., stem elongation in red amaranth and longer leaves in red lettuce, while the increase in the blue light fraction led to the upregulation of antioxidative components, especially total phenols, betalains (in red amaranth) and anthocyanins (in red lettuce). The antioxidant capacity of both crops was strongly positively correlated with the levels of these phytochemicals. Optimizing the red-to-blue ratio in LED lighting could be effective in promoting antioxidant-rich crops with potential health benefits for consumers.",11186462
"Although diets influence health and the environment, measuring and changing nutrition is challenging. Traditional measurement methods face challenges, and designing and conducting behavior-changing interventions is conceptually and logistically complicated. Situated local communities such as university campuses offer unique opportunities to shape the nutritional environment and promote health and sustainability. The present study investigates how passively sensed food purchase logs typically collected as part of regular business operations can be used to monitor and measure on-campus food consumption and understand food choice determinants. First, based on 38 million sales logs collected on a large university campus over eight years, we perform statistical analyses to quantify spatio-temporal determinants of food choice and characterize harmful patterns in dietary behaviors, in a case study of food purchasing at EPFL campus. We identify spatial proximity, food item pairing, and academic schedules (yearly and daily) as important determinants driving the on-campus food choice. The case studies demonstrate the potential of food sales logs for measuring nutrition and highlight the breadth and depth of future possibilities to study individual food-choice determinants. We describe how these insights provide an opportunity for stakeholders, such as campus offices responsible for managing food services, to shape the nutritional environment and improve health and sustainability by designing policies and behavioral interventions. Finally, based on the insights derived through the case study of food purchases at EPFL campus, we identify five future opportunities and offer a call to action for the nutrition research community to contribute to ensuring the health and sustainability of on-campus populations—the very communities to which many researchers belong.",11186467
"Effective implementation of strategies to promote health and prevent noncommunicable illnesses requires a profound understanding of the interaction between the individual and society. This study brings to health research the consideration of psychosocial factors that influence the maintenance and change of health behaviors and conduct. From a primary care perspective, it is crucial to propose a biopsychosocial approach for the development of health promotion and self-care programs that embrace personal aptitudes as a relevant individual aspect. To explore experiences related to personal aptitudes and personality traits that influence health behaviors and conduct, taking into account the social determinants of health, through a thematic analysis based on the capability-opportunity-motivation and behavior (COM-B) system. This qualitative research is carried out from a descriptive phenomenological perspective, based on 17 focus groups in which 156 people participated. Inductive and deductive analysis techniques were used following Lincoln and Guba’s criteria of methodological rigor. In addition to 7 different triangulations of analysts, 6 main categories were identified based on the COM-B system: psychological capacity, physical capacity, physical opportunity, social opportunity, reflective motivation, and automatic motivation. The importance of considering these factors to promote healthy behaviors was stressed. This study examined how personal experiences related personal aptitudes and personality traits influence health behaviors and conduct in Spain. It was found that personality traits such as health literacy, self-efficacy, activation, and self-determination can influence the adoption of healthy behaviors. Likewise, the need for control, overthinking, and ambivalence made it impossible. Furthermore, social determinants of health and interpersonal relationships also play an important role.

"Suicide-related outcomes among adolescents have become a serious public health problem worldwide. Emerging evidence suggests that sports participation may interact with suicide-related outcomes. The objective of this systematic review is to systematically review and summarize the association between sports participation and suicide-related outcomes among adolescents. A systematic review according to PRISMA Statement (International Platform of Registered Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols registration: INPLASY202330072) https://inplasy.com/inplasy-2023-3-0072/. The literature search was conducted in three electronic databases: Web of Science, PubMed, and EBSCOhost. A total of 16 studies (12 cross-sectional studies, 4 prospective studies) met the inclusion criteria were evaluated. Strong consistent evidence was found for the negative association between suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and sports participation among adolescents. There was insufficient evidence to support consistency in the association between sports participation and suicide plans, and no evidence regarding gender differences between sports participation and these suicide-related outcomes. Furthermore, there was heterogeneity in the measures of sports participation and suicide-related outcomes across the included studies. Evidence suggests that more sports participations are associated with lower suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in adolescents. However, the directionality of the observed associations should be examined based on more high-quality longitudinal studies in the future.",11186485
"Like all biological populations, viral populations exist as networks of genotypes connected through mutation. Mapping the topology of these networks and quantifying population dynamics across them is crucial to understanding how populations adapt to changes in their selective environment. The influence of mutational networks is especially profound in viral populations that rapidly explore their mutational neighborhoods via high mutation rates. Using a single-cell sequencing method, scRNA-seq–enabled acquisition of mRNA and consensus haplotypes linking individual genotypes and host transcriptomes (SEARCHLIGHT), we captured and assembled viral haplotypes from hundreds of individual infected cells, revealing the complexity of viral population structures. We obtained these genotypes in parallel with host cell transcriptome information, enabling us to link host cell transcriptional phenotypes to the genetic structures underlying virus adaptation. Our examination of these structures reveals the common evolutionary dynamics of enterovirus populations and illustrates how viral populations reach through mutational “tunnels” to span evolutionary landscapes and maintain connection with multiple adaptive genotypes simultaneously.",11186490
"Flexible and stretchable electronic devices are subject to failure because of vulnerable circuit interconnections. We develop a low-voltage (1.5 to 4.5 V) and rapid (as low as 5 s) electric welding strategy to integrate both rigid electronic components and soft sensors in flexible circuits under ambient conditions. This is achieved through the design of conductive elastomers composed of borate ester polymers and conductive fillers, which can be self-welded and generate welding effects to various materials including metals, hydrogels, and other conductive elastomers. The welding effect is generated through the electrochemical reaction–triggered exposure of interfacial adhesive promotors or the cleavage/reformation of dynamic bonds. Our strategy can ensure both mechanical compliance and conductivity at the circuit interfaces and easily produce welding strengths in the kilopascal to megapascal range. The as-designed conductive elastomers in combination with the electric welding technique provide a robust platform for constructing standalone flexible and stretchable electronic devices that are detachable and assemblable on demand.",11186498
"Platelet-producing megakaryocytes (MKs) primarily reside in the bone marrow, where they duplicate their DNA content with each cell cycle resulting in polyploid cells with an intricate demarcation membrane system. While key elements of the cytoskeletal reorganizations during proplatelet formation have been identified, what initiates the release of platelets into vessel sinusoids remains largely elusive. Using a cell cycle indicator, we observed a unique phenomenon, during which amplified centrosomes in MKs underwent clustering following mitosis, closely followed by proplatelet formation, which exclusively occurred in G1 of interphase. Forced cell cycle arrest in G1 increased proplatelet formation not only in vitro but also in vivo following short-term starvation of mice. We identified that inhibition of the centrosomal protein kinesin family member C1 (KIFC1) impaired clustering and subsequent proplatelet formation, while KIFC1-deficient mice exhibited reduced platelet counts. In summary, we identified KIFC1- and cell cycle–mediated centrosome clustering as an important initiator of proplatelet formation from MKs.",11186502
"To begin to optimize the immunization routes for our reported PLGA-rMOMP nanovaccine [PLGA-encapsulated Chlamydia muridarum (Cm) recombinant major outer membrane protein (rMOMP)], we compared two prime-boost immunization strategies [subcutaneous (SC) and intramuscular (IM-p) prime routes followed by two SC-boosts)] to evaluate the nanovaccine-induced protective efficacy and immunogenicity in female BALB/c mice. Our results showed that mice immunized via the SC and IM-p routes were protected against a Cm genital challenge by a reduction in bacterial burden and with fewer bacteria in the SC mice. Protection of mice correlated with rMOMP-specific Th1 (IL-2 and IFN-γ) and not Th2 (IL-4, IL-9, and IL-13) cytokines, and CD4+ memory (CD44highCD62Lhigh) T-cells, especially in the SC mice. We also observed higher levels of IL-1α, IL-6, IL-17, CCL-2, and G-CSF in SC-immunized mice. Notably, an increase of cytokines/chemokines was seen after the challenge in the SC, IM-p, and control mice (rMOMP and PBS), suggesting a Cm stimulation. In parallel, rMOMP-specific Th1 (IgG2a and IgG2b) and Th2 (IgG1) serum, mucosal, serum avidity, and neutralizing antibodies were more elevated in SC than in IM-p mice. Overall, the homologous SC prime-boost immunization of mice induced enhanced cellular and antibody responses with better protection against a genital challenge compared to the heterologous IM-p.",11186516
"Ubiquitination serves as a fundamental post-translational modification in numerous cellular events. Yet, its role in regulating corneal epithelial wound healing (CEWH) remains elusive. This study endeavored to determine the function and mechanism of ubiquitination in CEWH. Western blot and immunoprecipitation were used to discern ubiquitination alterations during CEWH in mice. Interventions, including neuronally expressed developmentally downregulated 4 (Nedd4) siRNA and proteasome/lysosome inhibitor, assessed their impact on CEWH. In vitro analyses, such as the scratch wound assay, MTS assay, and EdU staining, were conducted to gauge cell migration and proliferation in human corneal epithelial cells (HCECs). Moreover, transfection of miR-30/200 coupled with a luciferase activity assay ascertained their regulatory mechanism on Nedd4. Global ubiquitination levels were markedly increased during the mouse CEWH. Importantly, the application of either proteasomal or lysosomal inhibitors notably impeded the healing process both in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, Nedd4 was identified as an essential E3 ligase for CEWH. Nedd4 expression was significantly upregulated during CEWH. In vivo studies revealed that downregulation of Nedd4 substantially delayed CEWH, whereas further investigations underscored its role in regulating cell proliferation and migration, through the Stat3 pathway by targeting phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN). Notably, our findings pinpointed miR-30/200 family members as direct regulators of Nedd4. Ubiquitination holds pivotal significance in orchestrating CEWH. The critical E3 ligase Nedd4, under the regulatory purview of miR-30 and miR-200, facilitates CEWH through PTEN-mediated Stat3 signaling. This revelation sheds light on a prospective therapeutic target within the realm of CEWH.",11186577
"Background: The success of self-directed learning depends mainly on the readiness of students to adapt it to their learning domain. Medical students must meet certain criteria to become self-directed learners, which are also significant components of emotional intelligence (EI). Clarification is required on whether the students are ready for self-directed learning according to their level of EI as soon as they enter the medical institute. Materials and methods: The survey was conducted on first-year MBBS students, between 18 and 21 years of age. Demographic data of the participants was collected. EI was assessed by using the Schutte Self-Report Emotional Intelligence Test (SSEIT). Fisher’s 40-item self-directed learning readiness (SDLR) scale was used to assess the readiness for self-directed learning. Pearson’s correlation and regression analysis was carried out to assess the relationship between the two. Result: Approximately 71% of students had average EI, whereas only 5% had high EI. However, 63% of students were found to have low SDLR, while just 37% of participants had high SDLR. EI and SDLR both were found to be higher in males. Pearson’s correlation “r” between the two parameters shows a strong positive correlation with statistical significance. Conclusion: Certain training modules need to be incorporated into the medical education program to improve the EI of medical undergraduate students. Such a module might help in improving the readiness for self-directed learning and prepare the medical undergraduates as active lifelong learners, which is the prime goal for an Indian Medical Graduate according to the new Competency-Based Medical Education (CBME) curriculum.",11186586
"The overexpression of the prostate cancer antigen 3 (PCA3) gene is well-defined as a marker for prostate cancer (PCa) diagnosis. Although widely used in clinical research, PCA3 molecular mechanisms remain unknown. Herein we used phage display technology to identify putative molecules that bind to the promoter region of PCA3 gene and regulate its expression. The most frequent peptide PCA3p1 (80%) was similar to the Rho GTPase activating protein 21 (ARHGAP21) and its binding affinity was confirmed using Phage Bead ELISA. We showed that ARHGAP21 silencing in LNCaP prostate cancer cells decreased PCA3 and androgen receptor (AR) transcriptional levels and increased prune homolog 2 (PRUNE2) coding gene expression, indicating effective involvement of ARHGAP21 in androgen-dependent tumor pathway. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay confirmed the interaction between PCA3 promoter region and ARHGAP21. This is the first study that described the role of ARHGAP21 in regulating the PCA3 gene under the androgenic pathway, standing out as a new mechanism of gene regulatory control during prostatic oncogenesis.",11186590
"The purpose of this study was to verify the association between angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) genotypes DD, DI, and II and caffeine (CAF) ingestion on endurance performance, heart rate, ratio of perceived exertion (RPE), and habitual caffeine intake (HCI) of adolescent athletes. Seventy-four male adolescent athletes (age: DD=16±1.7; DI=16±2.0; II=15±1.7 years) ingested CAF (6 mg/kg) or placebo (PLA) one hour before performing the Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery level 1 (Yo-Yo IR1) test. No difference was found among groups for HCI. However, CAF increased the maximal distance covered and VO2max in DI and II genotype carriers compared to PLA (DD: Δ=31 m and 0.3 mL·kg-1·min-1; DI: Δ=286 m and 1.1 mL·kg-1·min-1; II: Δ=160 m and 1.4 mL·kg-1·min-1). Heart rate of DI and II genotype carriers increased with CAF compared to PLA, while RPE was higher in the II and lower in the DD genotypes. The correlations between HCI and maximal distance covered or VO2max were significant in the II genotype carriers with CAF. CAF increased endurance capacity, heart rate, and RPE in adolescent athletes with allele I, while endurance performance and aerobic power had a positive correlation to HCI in the II genotype group. These findings suggested that DD genotype were less responsive to CAF and that genetic variations should be taken into account when using CAF supplementation to enhance exercise performance.",11186592
"The chemical composition of foods is complex, variable, and dependent on many factors. This has a major impact on nutrition research as it foundationally aﬀects our ability to adequately assess the actual intake of nutrients and other compounds. In spite of this, accurate data on nutrient intake are key for investigating the associations and causal relationships between intake, health, and disease risk at the service of developing evidence-based dietary guidance that enables improvements in population health. Here, we exemplify the importance of this challenge by investigating the impact of food content variability on nutrition research using three bioactives as model: ﬂavan-3-ols, (–)-epicatechin, and nitrate. Our results show that common approaches aimed at addressing the high compositional variability of even the same foods impede the accurate assessment of nutrient intake generally. This suggests that the results of many nutrition studies using food composition data are potentially unreliable and carry greater limitations than commonly appreciated, consequently resulting in dietary recommendations with signiﬁcant limitations and unreliable impact on public health. Thus, current challenges related to nutrient intake assessments need to be addressed and mitigated by the development of improved dietary assessment methods involving the use of nutritional biomarkers.",11186626
"Extrachromosomal DNA is a common cause of oncogene amplification in cancer. The non-chromosomal inheritance of ecDNA enables tumors to rapidly evolve, contributing to treatment resistance and poor outcome for patients. The transcriptional context in which ecDNAs arise and progress, including chromosomally-driven transcription, is incompletely understood. We examined gene expression patterns of 870 tumors of varied histological types, to identify transcriptional correlates of ecDNA. Here, we show that ecDNA-containing tumors impact four major biological processes. Specifically, ecDNA-containing tumors up-regulate DNA damage and repair, cell cycle control, and mitotic processes, but down-regulate global immune regulation pathways. Taken together, these results suggest profound alterations in gene regulation in ecDNA-containing tumors, shedding light on molecular processes that give rise to their development and progression.",11186631
"Durable serological memory following vaccination is critically dependent on the production and survival of long-lived plasma cells (LLPCs). Yet, the factors that control LLPC specification and survival remain poorly resolved. Using intravital two-photon imaging, we find that in contrast to most plasma cells (PCs) in the bone marrow (BM), LLPCs are uniquely sessile and organized into clusters that are dependent on APRIL, an important survival factor. Using deep, bulk RNA sequencing, and surface protein flow-based phenotyping, we find that LLPCs express a unique transcriptome and phenotype compared to bulk PCs, fine-tuning expression of key cell surface molecules, CD93, CD81, CXCR4, CD326, CD44, and CD48, important for adhesion and homing. Conditional deletion of Cxcr4 in PCs following immunization leads to rapid mobilization from the BM, reduced survival of antigen-specific PCs, and ultimately accelerated decay of antibody titer. In naïve mice, the endogenous LLPCs BCR repertoire exhibits reduced diversity, reduced somatic mutations, and increased public clones and IgM isotypes, particularly in young mice, suggesting LLPC specification is non-random. As mice age, the BM PC compartment becomes enriched in LLPCs, which may outcompete and limit entry of new PCs into the LLPC niche and pool.",11186632
"ASARs are a family of very-long noncoding RNAs that control replication timing on individual human autosomes, and are essential for chromosome stability. The eight known ASAR lncRNAs remain closely associated with their parent chromosomes. Analysis of RNA-protein interaction data (from ENCODE) revealed numerous RBPs with significant interactions with multiple ASAR lncRNAs, with several hnRNPs as abundant interactors. An ~7 kb domain within the ASAR6-141 lncRNA shows a striking density of RBP interaction sites. Genetic deletion and ectopic integration assays indicate that this ~7 kb RNA binding protein domain contains functional sequences for controlling replication timing of entire chromosomes in cis. shRNA-mediated depletion of 10 different RNA binding proteins, including HNRNPA1, HNRNPC, HNRNPL, HNRNPM, HNRNPU, or HNRNPUL1, results in dissociation of ASAR lncRNAs from their chromosome territories, and disrupts the synchronous replication that occurs on all autosome pairs, recapitulating the effect of individual ASAR knockouts on a genome-wide scale. Our results further demonstrate the role that ASARs play during the temporal order of genome-wide replication, and we propose that ASARs function as essential RNA scaffolds for the assembly of hnRNP complexes that help maintain the structural integrity of each mammalian chromosome.",11186638
"Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), a rare complication of coexisting antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), poses significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges, especially with recurrent episodes. We present a 27-year-old male with catastrophic APS and SLE who experienced acute respiratory failure and hemoptysis due to DAH. Despite aggressive therapy with immunosuppressants, plasma exchange, and anticoagulation, he had recurrent DAH episodes requiring repeated admissions. Early recognition, multidisciplinary management, and utilization of effective targeted therapies, such as intravenous immunoglobulin, in refractory cases are crucial for improving outcomes in this challenging complication.",11186662
"The left and right anterior temporal lobes (ATLs) encode semantic representations. They show graded hemispheric specialization in function, with the left ATL contributing preferentially to verbal semantic processing. We investigated the cognitive correlates of this organization, using resting-state functional connectivity as a measure of functional segregation between ATLs. We analyzed two independent resting-state fMRI datasets (n = 86 and n = 642) in which participants’ verbal semantic expertise was measured using vocabulary tests. In both datasets, people with more advanced verbal semantic knowledge showed weaker functional connectivity between left and right ventral ATLs. This effect was highly specific. It was not observed for within-hemisphere connections between semantic regions (ventral ATL and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), though it was found for left–right IFG connectivity in one dataset). Effects were not found for tasks probing semantic control, nonsemantic cognition, or face recognition. Our results suggest that hemispheric specialization in the ATLs is not an innate property but rather emerges as people develop highly detailed verbal semantic representations. We speculate that this effect is a consequence of the left ATL’s greater connectivity with left-lateralized written word recognition regions, which causes it to preferentially represent meaning for advanced vocabulary acquired primarily through reading.",11186671
"Recent work suggests that the adult human brain is very adaptable when it comes to sensory processing. In this context, it has also been suggested that structural “blueprints” may fundamentally constrain neuroplastic change, e.g. in response to sensory deprivation. Here, we trained 12 blind participants and 14 sighted participants in echolocation over a 10-week period, and used MRI in a pre–post design to measure functional and structural brain changes. We found that blind participants and sighted participants together showed a training-induced increase in activation in left and right V1 in response to echoes, a finding difficult to reconcile with the view that sensory cortex is strictly organized by modality. Further, blind participants and sighted participants showed a training induced increase in activation in right A1 in response to sounds per se (i.e. not echo-specific), and this was accompanied by an increase in gray matter density in right A1 in blind participants and in adjacent acoustic areas in sighted participants. The similarity in functional results between sighted participants and blind participants is consistent with the idea that reorganization may be governed by similar principles in the two groups, yet our structural analyses also showed differences between the groups suggesting that a more nuanced view may be required.",11186672
"Obesity, a pressing global health issue worldwide, contributes to risk factors such as hypertension and dyslipidemia, creating an unfavorable cardiovascular environment and increasing the likelihood of adverse cardiac events. His study aims to assess the impact of obesity on various cardiovascular parameters.   A cross-sectional analysis was conducted at a Heart Center, focusing on adults admitted for suspected heart diseases. The dataset included information on demographics, clinical history, laboratory results, and echocardiography. Descriptive analysis and multiple linear regression were employed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 26.   The study of 105 individuals with suspected heart diseases revealed prevalent health factors such as hypertension (47.6%) and hyperlipidemia (61%). Body mass index (BMI) averaged 30, indicating a trend toward overweight. Obesity significantly associated with higher systolic blood pressure (SBP, p=0.005) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP, p=0.002), larger cardiac volumes (end-diastolic volume, EDV, p=0.013; end-systolic volume, ESV, p=0.040), and a marginally significant influence on left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD, p=0.068). No significant associations were found with left ventricular end-systolic diameter (LVEDS), heart rate (HR), or ejection fraction (EF).   Our study highlights a significant association between obesity and elevated blood pressure, larger cardiac volumes, and a marginal impact on left ventricular end-diastolic diameter. While caution is needed in inferring causation due to the study's cross-sectional nature, these findings underscore the importance of addressing obesity as a potential risk factor for adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Further investigations are warranted to enhance our understanding of the complex interplay between obesity and cardiovascular health.",11186677
"Hyperplastic pulpitis is an irreversible type of pulpitis that primarily affects young patients. It occurs when an inflamed pulp becomes exposed due to factors such as dental caries, dental trauma, or other causes. Root canal treatment is commonly employed to manage hyperplastic pulpitis. However, vital pulp therapy can be considered as a less invasive option. The main objective of this treatment is to preserve the vitality and functionality of the remaining pulp tissue. This case report discusses the potential management of hyperplastic pulpitis in an immature molar using vital pulp therapy instead of a full root canal treatment. The report includes clinical and radiographic follow-up at six and twelve months.",11186690
"Partial and full PPAR-γ agonists have shown promising effects and antihypertensive and antidiabetic agents through increased plasma adiponectin concentration. This study is aimed at examining the role of PPAR-γ, alpha-adrenoceptors, and adiponectin receptors in the modulation of vasopressor responses to angiotensin II (Ang II) and adrenergic agonists, after a subset treatment of partial and full PPAR-γ agonists, each individually, and also when coupled with adiponectin in SHRs. The antioxidant potential and metabolic indices for these animals were also determined. Group I (WKY) and group II (SHR) were designated as normotensive control and hypertensive control, respectively. Groups III (SHR) and IV (SHR) received irbesartan (30 mg/kg) and pioglitazone (10 mg/kg) orally for 28 days, and groups V (SHR), VI (SHR), and VII (SHR) were treated with adiponectin (2.5 μg/kg) intraperitoneally alone, in combination with irbesartan, and in combination with pioglitazone, respectively, from days 21 to 28 only. On day 29, sodium pentobarbitone (60 mg/kg) was used to anesthetize all test animals, and systemic hemodynamic and plasma adiponectin concentrations and in vitro and in vivo antioxidant potential were measured. As compared to the WKY control, the SHR control group's noninvasive blood pressure and basal mean arterial pressure were significantly greater, along with increased arterial stiffness, lower plasma nitric oxide, adiponectin concentration, and antioxidant enzyme levels (all P < 0.05). However, they were gradually normalized by single drug treatments in all groups, and to a greater extent in the SHR + Irb + Adp group (P < 0.05). In the acute study, the dose dependant mean arterial pressure responses to intravenously administered adrenergic agonists and angiotensin-II were significantly larger in SHRs as compared to WKY by 20-25%. Adiponectin alone and in combination significantly blunted vasopressor responses to these alpha-adrenergic agonists in the SHR + Pio + Adp group by 63%, whereas attenuated responses to ANG-II administration to 70% in SHR + Irb + Adp. In conclusion, the combined treatment of adiponectin with PPAR-agonists reduced the systemic vascular responses to adrenergic agonists and improved arterial stiffness. This an evidence of the interaction of adiponectin receptors, PPAR-γ, alpha-adrenoceptors, and ANG-II in the systemic vasculature of SHRs. A significant level of synergism has also been proved among full PPAR-γ agonists and adiponectin receptors.",11186691
