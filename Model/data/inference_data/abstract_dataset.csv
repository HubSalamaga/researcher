Abstract,ID
"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common, complex genetic disorder affecting up to 15% of reproductive-age women worldwide, depending on the diagnostic criteria applied. These diagnostic criteria are based on expert opinion and have been the subject of considerable controversy. The phenotypic variation observed in PCOS is suggestive of an underlying genetic heterogeneity, but a recent meta-analysis of European ancestry PCOS cases found that the genetic architecture of PCOS defined by different diagnostic criteria was generally similar, suggesting that the criteria do not identify biologically distinct disease subtypes. We performed this study to test the hypothesis that there are biologically relevant subtypes of PCOS. Using biochemical and genotype data from a previously published PCOS genome-wide association study (GWAS), we investigated whether there were reproducible phenotypic subtypes of PCOS with subtype-specific genetic associations. Unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis was performed on quantitative anthropometric, reproductive, and metabolic traits in a genotyped cohort of 893 PCOS cases (median and interquartile range [IQR]: age = 28 [25-32], body mass index [BMI] = 35.4 [28.2-41.5]). The clusters were replicated in an independent, ungenotyped cohort of 263 PCOS cases (median and IQR: age = 28 [24-33], BMI = 35.7 [28.4-42.3]). The clustering revealed 2 distinct PCOS subtypes: a reproductive group (21%-23%), characterized by higher luteinizing hormone (LH) and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) levels with relatively low BMI and insulin levels, and a metabolic group (37%-39%), characterized by higher BMI, glucose, and insulin levels with lower SHBG and LH levels. We performed a GWAS on the genotyped cohort, limiting the cases to either the reproductive or metabolic subtypes. We identified alleles in 4 loci that were associated with the reproductive subtype at genome-wide significance (PRDM2/KAZN, P = 2.2 × 10-10; IQCA1, P = 2.8 × 10-9; BMPR1B/UNC5C, P = 9.7 × 10-9; CDH10, P = 1.2 × 10-8) and one locus that was significantly associated with the metabolic subtype (KCNH7/FIGN, P = 1.0 × 10-8). We developed a predictive model to classify a separate, family-based cohort of 73 women with PCOS (median and IQR: age = 28 [25-33], BMI = 34.3 [27.8-42.3]) and found that the subtypes tended to cluster in families and that carriers of previously reported rare variants in DENND1A, a gene that regulates androgen biosynthesis, were significantly more likely to have the reproductive subtype of PCOS. Limitations of our study were that only PCOS cases of European ancestry diagnosed by National Institutes of Health (NIH) criteria were included, the sample sizes for the subtype GWAS were small, and the GWAS findings were not replicated. In conclusion, we have found reproducible reproductive and metabolic subtypes of PCOS. Furthermore, these subtypes were associated with novel, to our knowledge, susceptibility loci. Our results suggest that these subtypes are biologically relevant because they appear to have distinct genetic architecture. This study demonstrates how phenotypic subtyping can be used to gain additional insights from GWAS data.",32574161
"Can a targeted whole exome sequencing (WES) on a cohort of women showing a primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) phenotype at a young age, combined with a study of copy number variations, identify variants in candidate genes confirming their deleterious effect on ovarian function? This integrated approach has proved effective in identifying novel candidate genes unveiling mechanisms involved in POI pathogenesis. POI, a condition occurring in 1% of women under 40 years of age, affects women’s fertility leading to a premature loss of ovarian reserve. The genetic causes of POI are highly heterogeneous and several determinants contributing to its prominent oligogenic inheritance pattern still need to be elucidated. WES screening for pathogenic variants of 41 Italian women with non-syndromic primary and early secondary amenorrhoea occurring before age 25 was replicated on another 60 POI patients, including 35 French and 25 American women, to reveal statistically significant shared variants. The Italian POI patients’ DNA were processed by targeted WES including 542 RefSeq genes expressed or functioning during distinct reproductive or ovarian processes (e.g. DNA repair, meiosis, oocyte maturation, folliculogenesis and menopause). Extremely rare variants were filtered and selected by means of a Fisher Exact test using several publicly available datasets. A case-control Burden test was applied to highlight the most significant genes using two ad-hoc control female cohorts. To support the obtained data, the identified genes were screened on a novel cohort of 60 Caucasian POI patients and the same case-control analysis was carried out. Comparative analysis of the human identified genes was performed on mouse and Drosophila melanogaster by analysing the orthologous genes in their ovarian phenotype, and two of the selected genes were fruit fly modelled to explore their role in fertility. The filtering steps applied to search for extremely rare pathogenic variants in the Italian cohort revealed 64 validated single-nucleotide variants/Indels in 59 genes in 30 out of 41 screened women. Burden test analysis highlighted 13 ovarian genes as being the most enriched and significant. To validate these findings, filtering steps and Burden analysis on the second cohort of Caucasian patients yielded 11 significantly enriched genes. Among them, AFP, DMRT3, MOV10, FYN and MYC were significant in both patient cohorts and hence were considered strong candidates for POI. Mouse and Drosophila comparative analysis evaluated a conserved role through the evolution of several candidates, and functional studies using a Drosophila model, when applicable, supported the conserved role of the MOV10 armitage and DMRT3 dmrt93B orthologues in female fertility. The datasets for the Italian cohort generated during the current study are publicly available at ClinVar database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/): accession numbers SCV001364312 to SCV001364375. This is a targeted WES analysis hunting variants in candidate genes previously identified by different genomic approaches. For most of the investigated sporadic cases, we could not track the parental inheritance, due to unavailability of the parents’ DNA samples; in addition, we might have overlooked additional rare variants in novel candidate POI genes extracted from the exome data. On the contrary, we might have considered some inherited variants whose clinical significance is uncertain and might not be causative for the patients’ phenotype. Additionally, as regards the Drosophila model, it will be extremely important in the future to have more mutants or RNAi strains available for each candidate gene in order to validate their role in POI pathogenesis. The genomic, statistical, comparative and functional approaches integrated in our study convincingly support the extremely heterogeneous oligogenic nature of POI, and confirm the maintenance across the evolution of some key genes safeguarding fertility and successful reproduction. Two principal classes of genes were identified: (i) genes primarily involved in meiosis, namely in synaptonemal complex formation, asymmetric division and oocyte maturation and (ii) genes safeguarding cell maintenance (piRNA and DNA repair pathways). This work was supported by Italian Ministry of Health grants ‘Ricerca Corrente’ (08C621_2016 and 08C924_2019) provided to IRCCS Istituto Auxologico Italiano, and by ‘Piano Sostegno alla Ricerca’ (PSR2020_FINELLI_LINEA_B) provided by the University of Milan; M.P.B. was supported by Telethon-Italy (grant number GG14181).

"Endometriosis, regarded as a complex disease, is influenced by multiple genetic factors. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWASs) in endometriosis have identified several susceptibility loci in Caucasian and Japanese populations. However, the overlapped susceptible loci were few. This case-control study tried to identify risk loci-related genes for ovarian endometrioma in Chinese Han women from central China using DNA pooling-based GWAS. Genome DNA samples were extracted from 3038 participants in central China. Pooling-based genome-wide scan and individual genotyping were performed using Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 and IPLEX Gold system, which demonstrated 10 ovarian endometrioma-related novel risk loci. There were 3 of them with P value < 5 × 10-06, separately locating in intron of insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor, chromosome 7 open reading frame 50, and Meis homeobox 1. In conclusion, the pooling-based GWAS for ovarian endometrioma identified some novel single-nucleotide polymorphisms in Chinese Han women of central China. Further assessment in other samples will be crucial to confirm the susceptibility of these results and explore the mechanisms of the related genes in the pathogenesis of ovarian endometrioma.",27506219
"Endometriosis is a common gynaecological disease, associated with severe pelvic pain and reduced fertility; however, molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are able to identify genetic loci, which can play significant role during endometriosis development. The study aimed at localisation of new genes and chromosomal loci, the nucleotide variants of which determine the level of susceptibility to endometriosis. Blood samples from 171 patients with endometriosis were used as material for studies. The patients were recruited to the study at the Department of Operative Gynaecology of the Institute of the Polish Mother's Memorial Hospital in Lodz. A control group (n=2934) came from the POPULOUS collection registered at Biobank Lab, Department of Molecular Biophysics, University of Lodz. DNA of the patients with endometriosis was compared with DNA of women free from that disease, the comparison being supported by GWAS. Genome-wide significant correlation was identified between one new, not previously described, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs10129516, localised on chromosome 14 in intergenic region between PARP1P2 and RHOJ genes (p=1.44×10-10, OR=3.104, 95% CI=2.329-4.136) and endometriosis. We have also identified significant association with endometriosis of 18 SNPs localised on chromosome 6 in position range 31883957 - 32681631 (C2 and HLA-DRA genes region) with the lowest observed p value for rs644045 in C2 gene (p=2.04×10-8, OR=1.955, 95% CI=1.541-2.480). Reported GWAS identified the novel loci associated with endometriosis in Polish women, not previously reported. The most interesting observation shown in our study are regions associated with susceptibility to endometriosis of loci located near C2, HLA-DRA and RHOJ genes. Results of that study did not correspond to previously published data about polymorphism in that regions and further evaluations are necessary in groups with higher numbers of patients to explain whether the above-mentioned genetic variant may be the risk factor for pathogenesis of endometriosis.",28881265
"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a disorder characterized by hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction and polycystic ovarian morphology. Affected women frequently have metabolic disturbances including insulin resistance and dysregulation of glucose homeostasis. PCOS is diagnosed with two different sets of diagnostic criteria, resulting in a phenotypic spectrum of PCOS cases. The genetic similarities between cases diagnosed based on the two criteria have been largely unknown. Previous studies in Chinese and European subjects have identified 16 loci associated with risk of PCOS. We report a fixed-effect, inverse-weighted-variance meta-analysis from 10,074 PCOS cases and 103,164 controls of European ancestry and characterisation of PCOS related traits. We identified 3 novel loci (near PLGRKT, ZBTB16 and MAPRE1), and provide replication of 11 previously reported loci. Only one locus differed significantly in its association by diagnostic criteria; otherwise the genetic architecture was similar between PCOS diagnosed by self-report and PCOS diagnosed by NIH or non-NIH Rotterdam criteria across common variants at 13 loci. Identified variants were associated with hyperandrogenism, gonadotropin regulation and testosterone levels in affected women. Linkage disequilibrium score regression analysis revealed genetic correlations with obesity, fasting insulin, type 2 diabetes, lipid levels and coronary artery disease, indicating shared genetic architecture between metabolic traits and PCOS. Mendelian randomization analyses suggested variants associated with body mass index, fasting insulin, menopause timing, depression and male-pattern balding play a causal role in PCOS. The data thus demonstrate 3 novel loci associated with PCOS and similar genetic architecture for all diagnostic criteria. The data also provide the first genetic evidence for a male phenotype for PCOS and a causal link to depression, a previously hypothesized comorbid disease. Thus, the genetics provide a comprehensive view of PCOS that encompasses multiple diagnostic criteria, gender, reproductive potential and mental health.",30566500
"Recently, several research groups have evaluated CAPN10 gene in polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) patients and other phenotypes, including hirsutism or intermediate phenotypes of PCOS. Molecular genetic analysis of CAPN10 gene indicates that different alleles may play a role in PCOS susceptibility and could be associated with idiopathic hirsutism. However, these observations are not exempt from controversy, because independent studies cannot replicate these preliminary findings. We present a haplotype-phenotype correlation study of CAPN10 haplotypes in 148 women showing ecographically detected polycystic ovaries (PCO) combined with one or more of these clinical symptoms: amenorrhea or severe oligomenorrhea, hyperandrogenism, and anovulatory infertility, as well as 93 unrelated controls. We have reconstructed and analyzed 482 CAPN10 haplotypes in patients and controls. We detected the association of UCSNP-44 allele with PCO phenotype in the Spanish population (P = 0.02). In addition, we identified several CAPN10 alleles associated to phenotypic differences observed between PCO patients, such as the presence of hypercholesterolemia (haplotype 1121, P = 0.005), presence of hyperandrogenic features (P = 0.05), and familial cancer incidence (haplotype 1111, P = 0.0005). Our results confirm the association of UCSNP-44 allele with PCO phenotype in the Spanish population. Moreover, we have identified novel candidate risk alleles and genotypes, within CAPN10 gene, that could be associated with important phenotypic and prognosis differences observed in PCOS patients.",14602801
"Epidemiological data on rare diseases in China are currently limited. The objective of this study was to provide a comprehensive understanding of the prevalence and incidence of rare diseases by systematically analyzing the available epidemiological data. We conducted a comprehensive search of English and Chinese databases, the Incidence and Prevalence Database, the Chinese Rare Disease Guideline, and the Taiwan Health Promotion Administration from 2010 to 2023. We identified the top diseases and regions based on epidemiological data and present the maximum, minimum, and median prevalence and incidence values in tables and forest plots. 1,264 prevalence and incidence data were retrieved from 277 studies, guidelines and official websites, covering 110 rare diseases (53.1%) and 32 regions (94.1%). In terms of geographical regions, incidence or prevalence data were available for 32 regions (94.1%), excluding Tibet Hui Autonomous Region and Macao Special Administrative Region. In terms of rate, 60 and 77 out of 207 diseases (29.0% and 37.2%) had available incidence and prevalence data, respectively. Eight diseases had an incidence rate equal to or greater than that of 1,000 patients per million. The present study provides a comprehensive epidemiological analysis and valuable insights into the prevalence and incidence of rare diseases in China. Our findings underscore the pressing need for sustained drug research and medical support for individuals and families impacted by rare diseases.",11145401
"Rapid onset obesity with hypoventilation, hypothalamic, and autonomic dysregulation (ROHHAD) syndrome in childhood is characterized by abrupt onset weight gain and dysautonomia with variable neuroendocrine involvement. In the absence of definitive disease-modifying therapies, the primary management strategy remains symptom control. This case report describes the first successful correction of obesity, dysautonomia, and metabolic derangement in a patient with ROHHAD following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Anthropometrics, metabolic profiling, and stool microbiome composition were assessed in a longitudinal fashion. In the 48-month period following surgery, the patient body mass index (BMI) reduced by 9.5 kg/m2 and metabolic status improved, evidenced in weaning of insulin, and improved glycated hemoglobin, lipid profile, and hepatic enzymes. Chronic diarrhea resolved after surgery and prior to significant weight loss. Evaluation of stool bacterial composition and biomass demonstrated shifts in absolute abundance and taxonomic composition in longitudinal samples following surgery. This case demonstrates the potential efficacy of bariatric surgery in correcting the metabolic disruption of ROHHAD syndrome, producing long-term changes in gut microbiome composition and biomass.",11146140
"Methylation-mediated gene silencing is closely related to the occurrence and development of human tumors. The euchromatic histone lysine methyltransferase 2 (EHMT2, also known as G9a) is highly expressed in many tumors and is generally considered to be an oncogene, which is associated with the poor outcome of many tumors. Combined immunotherapy and immune checkpoint blockade therapy also have good efficacy and certain safety. However, there are still many difficulties in the drugs targeting G9a, and the combined effect and safety of G9a with many drugs is still under study. This article aims to summarize the role and mechanism of G9a and its inhibitors in tumors in the past two years, and to understand the application prospect of G9a from the perspective of diagnosis and treatment.",11146345
"The study aimed to systematically evaluate the relationship between CYP3A5*3 gene polymorphisms and the blood concentration and effectiveness of tacrolimus (TAC) in patients with membranous nephropathy (MN). PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, Web of Science, China Biomedical, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang, Vipshop, ReadShow, Clinical Trials Registry, and other databases were searched. Studies on the relationship between CYP3A5*3 gene polymorphism and TAC blood concentration in MN patients were collected, and meta-analysis was performed using Stata 16 software.  A total of eight publications were included in the study, including 498 MN patients. CYP3A5*3 gene polymorphisms are associated with tacrolimus blood levels in patients with MN. The results of the relationship between CYP3A5*3 genotype polymorphisms and tacrolimus blood trough concentrations of the AA + AG genotype were lower than those of the GG genotype at ≤1 month [WMD = −2.08, 95% CI (−2.57, −1.59), p < 0.001] and 1–6 months [WMD = −0.63, 95% CI (−0.98, −0.27), p < 0.001]; however, they were not statistically significant at ≥6 months (p = 0.211). Furthermore, the subgroup analysis revealed that the dose-adjusted concentration of tacrolimus (C0/D) of the AA + AG genotype was lower than that of the GG genotype at ≤1 month [SMD = −1.93, 95% CI (−2.79, −1.08), p < 0.001], 1–6 months [SMD = −2.25, 95% CI (−2.71, −1.79), p < 0.001], and ≥6 months [SMD = −2.36, 95% CI (−2.86, −1.86), p < 0.001]. In addition, there was no statistically significant difference in effectiveness between the two groups at 3, 6, and 12 months of TAC administration (p > 0.05). Serum TAC concentrations in MN patients were correlated with CYP3A5*3 genotype polymorphisms. Detection of the CYP3A5*3 genotype before the administration of TAC may provide some clinical value for optimizing the treatment of MN patients. https://inplasy.com/, identifier [INPLASY202430083].",11148365
"This case report describes an exceptionally rare case in which a prior diagnosis of schizophrenia was later determined to be early-onset Fahr’s disease, linked to a genetic mutation in the SLC20A2 gene. Initially, the patient exhibited symptoms resembling schizophrenia, including aggression and hostility, and was highly susceptible to medication side effects such as restlessness and Parkinsonism. Despite maintaining independent activities of daily living, his neurological examinations revealed hidden weakness on the left side. Following adjustments to the medication regimen, stability was achieved with residual psychotic symptoms under treatment with Risperidone 1.5mg/day, Valproic acid 1500mg/day, and Quetiapine 37.5mg/day. This case underscores the importance of conducting comprehensive imaging studies at the time of initial psychiatric diagnosis, regardless of the apparent typicality of the presentation. Additionally, it emphasizes the need for patience and adherence to the “Start Low and Go Slow” approach in medication management to minimize the risk of exacerbating psychiatric symptoms and aggression.",11148442
"The efficacy of anthracycline-based chemotherapeutics, which include doxorubicin and its structural relatives daunorubicin and idarubicin, remains almost unmatched in oncology, despite a side effect profile including cumulative dose-dependent cardiotoxicity, therapy-related malignancies and infertility. Detoxifying anthracyclines while preserving their anti-neoplastic effects is arguably a major unmet need in modern oncology, as cardiovascular complications that limit anti-cancer treatment are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among the 17 million cancer survivors in the U.S. In this study, we examined different clinically relevant anthracycline drugs for a series of features including mode of action (chromatin and DNA damage), bio-distribution, anti-tumor efficacy and cardiotoxicity in pre-clinical models and patients. The different anthracycline drugs have surprisingly individual efficacy and toxicity profiles. In particular, aclarubicin stands out in pre-clinical models and clinical studies, as it potently kills cancer cells, lacks cardiotoxicity, and can be safely administered even after the maximum cumulative dose of either doxorubicin or idarubicin has been reached. Retrospective analysis of aclarubicin used as second-line treatment for relapsed/refractory AML patients showed survival effects similar to its use in first line, leading to a notable 23% increase in 5-year overall survival compared to other intensive chemotherapies. Considering individual anthracyclines as distinct entities unveils new treatment options, such as the identification of aclarubicin, which significantly improves the survival outcomes of AML patients while mitigating the treatment-limiting side-effects. Building upon these findings, an international multicenter Phase III prospective study is prepared, to integrate aclarubicin into the treatment of relapsed/refractory AML patients. The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12943-024-02034-7.",11149191
"The FGFR signaling pathway is integral to cellular activities, including proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Dysregulation of this pathway is implicated in numerous human cancers, positioning FGFR as a prominent therapeutic target. Here, we conduct a comprehensive review of the function, signaling pathways and abnormal alterations of FGFR, as well as its role in tumorigenesis and development. Additionally, we provide an in-depth analysis of pivotal phase 2 and 3 clinical trials evaluating the performance and safety of FGFR inhibitors in oncology, thereby shedding light on the current state of clinical research in this field. Then, we highlight four drugs that have been approved for marketing by the FDA, offering insights into their molecular mechanisms and clinical achievements. Our discussion encompasses the intricate landscape of FGFR-driven tumorigenesis, current techniques for pinpointing FGFR anomalies, and clinical experiences with FGFR inhibitor regimens. Furthermore, we discuss the inherent challenges of targeting the FGFR pathway, encompassing resistance mechanisms such as activation by gatekeeper mutations, alternative pathways, and potential adverse reactions. By synthesizing the current evidence, we underscore the potential of FGFR-centric therapies to enhance patient prognosis, while emphasizing the imperative need for continued research to surmount resistance and optimize treatment modalities.",11149307
"We employed single‐cell analysis techniques, specifically the inferCNV method, to dissect the complex progression of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) from adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) through minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA) to invasive adenocarcinoma (IAC). This approach enabled the identification of Cluster 6, which was significantly associated with LUAD progression. Our comprehensive analysis included intercellular interaction, transcription factor regulatory networks, trajectory analysis, and gene set variation analysis (GSVA), leading to the development of the lung progression associated signature (LPAS). Interestingly, we discovered that the LPAS not only accurately predicts the prognosis of LUAD patients but also forecasts genomic alterations, distinguishes between ‘cold’ and ‘hot’ tumours, and identifies potential candidates suitable for immunotherapy. PSMB1, identified within Cluster 6, was experimentally shown to significantly enhance cancer cell invasion and migration, highlighting the clinical relevance of LPAS in predicting LUAD progression and providing a potential target for therapeutic intervention. Our findings suggest that LPAS offers a novel biomarker for LUAD patient stratification, with significant implications for improving prognostic accuracy and guiding treatment decisions.",11149493
"Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD), a member of highly lethal malignant tumors, has a poor outcome and extremely poor prognosis. The transient receptor potential (TRP) superfamily, a group of nonselective cation channels, is capable of influencing cellular functions by regulating calcium homeostasis. In addition, it has been shown that TRP channels can also affect various cellular phenotypes by regulating gene transcription levels and are involved in the development of a variety of malignant tumors. In order to find new therapeutic targets and biomarkers to improve the clinical prognosis of pancreatic cancer, we performed genetic and immunological characterization of TRP channels in PAAD, as well as related functional and prognostic analyses. We investigated the expression, genetic alterations, methylation levels, and immune infiltration levels of TRP channels in PAAD, and further also analyzed the function of TRP channels in PAAD and their prognostic value for PAAD patients. Our results suggest that TRPM8 may contribute to tumor proliferation by controlling the PI3K‐AKT–mTOR signaling pathway in PAAD. After careful evaluation of the accumulated data, we concluded that TRPM8 has potential as a prognostic indicator and prospective therapeutic target in PAAD.",11150080
"Thyroid surgery in pediatric population is not as common as that in adults, although they share the same indications, techniques and complications. This review aims to evaluate the surgical management of thyroid disease in patients under 18 years old. We conducted a bibliographic search in the international literature. Data from the identified studies such as demographics, indication for surgery, type of procedure, complications and length of hospital stay were recorded. A retrospective review study of all patients under 18 years old who underwent thyroidectomy was performed. We included 37 retrospective studies and a total of 12,728 patients. Thyroidectomy was more common in female patients and the mean age was approximately 14 years old. The leading indication for surgery was benign thyroid pathology. Due to the surgical treatments’ safety and effectiveness in young patients, total and subtotal thyroidectomy, whether for malignancies or benign diseases, is becoming more popular today. The most often occurring complication of pediatric thyroid surgery is hypoparathyroidism. Despite the high likelihood of recurrence of pediatric malignancies, overall survival rates of pediatric thyroid cancer are excellent. Thyroidectomy performed by high-volume thyroid surgeons in children and adolescents is considered an efficient and safe method of treatment of thyroid disease.",11150202
"According to the PRISMA criteria, a systematic review has been conducted to investigate the clinical relevance between patients with severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) and cyclic congenital neutropenia (CyN) induced by ELANE mutations. We have searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane, CNKI, Wanfang Medicine, and VIP for ELANE mutation related literature published from 1997 to 2022. Using Microsoft Excel collect and organize data, SPSS 25, GraphPad Prism 8.0.1, and Omap analyze and plot statistical. Compare the gender, age, geography, mutation sites, infection characteristics, treatment, and other factors of SCN and CyN patients induced by ELANE mutations, with a focus on exploring the relationship between genotype and clinical characteristics, genotype and prognosis. This study has included a total of 467 patients with SCN and 90 patients with CyN. The onset age of SCN and CyN are both less than 1 year old, and the onset and diagnosis age of SCN are both younger than CyN. The mutation of ELANE gene is mainly missense mutation, and hot spot mutations include S126L, P139L, G214R, c.597+1G>A. The high-frequency mutations with severe outcomes are A57V, L121H, L121P, c.597+1G>A, c.597+1G>T, S126L, C151Y, C151S, G214R, C223X. Respiratory tract, skin and mucosa are the most common infection sites, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli are the most common. Patients with refractory G-CSF are more likely to develop severe outcomes. The commonly used pre-treatment schemes for transplantation are Bu-Cy-ATG and Flu-Bu-ATG.

"Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder characterized by recurrent epilepsy episodes. As a non-pharmacological treatment, the ketogenic diet has been widely applied in treating epilepsy. However, the exact therapeutic mechanism of the ketogenic diet for epilepsy remains unclear. This study investigates the molecular mechanisms of the ketogenic diet in regulating fatty acid metabolism and activating the ADCY3-initiated cAMP signaling pathway to enhance neuronal inhibition and thereby treat epilepsy. Meta-analysis reveals that the ketogenic diet is superior to the conventional diet in treating epilepsy. Animal experiments demonstrate that the ketogenic diet is more effective than the conventional diet in treating epilepsy, with the best results achieved using the classic ketogenic diet. Transcriptome sequencing analysis identifies six essential genes, among which ADCY3 shows increased expression in the ketogenic diet. In vivo experiments confirm that the activation of the cAMP-PKA signaling pathway by ADCY3 enhances neuronal inhibition and improves epilepsy control. Clinical observations indicate that the ketogenic diet improves patient epilepsy episodes by regulating the ADCY3-initiated cAMP signaling pathway.",11150708
"Chronic hepatitis B poses a significant global burden, modulating immune cells, leading to chronic inflammation and long-term damage. Due to its hepatotropism, the hepatitis B virus (HBV) cannot infect other cells. The mechanisms underlying the intercellular communication among different liver cells in HBV-infected individuals and the immune microenvironment imbalance remain elusive. Exosomes, as important intercellular communication and cargo transportation tools between HBV-infected hepatocytes and immune cells, have been shown to assist in HBV cargo transportation and regulate the immune microenvironment. However, the role of exosomes in hepatitis B has only gradually received attention in recent years. Minimal literature has systematically elaborated on the role of exosomes in reshaping the immune microenvironment of the liver. This review unfolds sequentially based on the biological processes of exosomes: exosomes’ biogenesis, release, transport, uptake by recipient cells, and their impact on recipient cells. We delineate how HBV influences the biogenesis of exosomes, utilizing exosomal covert transmission, and reshapes the hepatic immune microenvironment. And based on the characteristics and functions of exosomes, potential applications of exosomes in hepatitis B are summarized and predicted.",11151510
"The rapid progression of genomics and proteomics has been driven by the advent of advanced sequencing technologies, large, diverse, and readily available omics datasets, and the evolution of computational data processing capabilities. The vast amount of data generated by these advancements necessitates efficient algorithms to extract meaningful information. K-mers serve as a valuable tool when working with large sequencing datasets, offering several advantages in computational speed and memory efficiency and carrying the potential for intrinsic biological functionality. This review provides an overview of the methods, applications, and significance of k-mers in genomic and proteomic data analyses, as well as the utility of absent sequences, including nullomers and nullpeptides, in disease detection, vaccine development, therapeutics, and forensic science. Therefore, the review highlights the pivotal role of k-mers in addressing current genomic and proteomic problems and underscores their potential for future breakthroughs in research.",11152613
"Many types of gynecological cancer (GC) are often silent until they reach an advanced stage, and are therefore often diagnosed too late for effective treatment. Hence, there is a real need for more efficient diagnosis and treatment for patients with GC. During recent years, researchers have increasingly studied the impact of microRNAs cancer development, leading to a number of applications in detection and treatment. MicroRNAs are a particular group of tiny RNA molecules that regulate regular gene expression by affecting the translation process. The downregulation of numerous miRNAs has been observed in human malignancies. Let-7 is an example of a miRNA that controls cellular processes as well as signaling cascades to affect post-transcriptional gene expression. Recent research supports the hypothesis that enhancing let-7 expression in those cancers where it is downregulated may be a potential treatment option. Exosomes are tiny vesicles that move through body fluids and can include components like miRNAs (including let-7) that are important for communication between cells. Studies proved that exosomes are able to enhance tumor growth, angiogenesis, chemoresistance, metastasis, and immune evasion, thus suggesting their importance in GC management. Impact of let-7 on female malignancies and diseases of the female reproductive tract. Let-7 expression is dysregulated in a variety of gynaecological and obstetric disorders.",11153289
"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide and is prevalent in East Asia. Although genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of HCC have identified 23 risk regions, the susceptibility genes underlying these associations largely remain unclear. To identify novel candidate genes for HCC, we conducted liver single-tissue and cross-tissue transcriptome-wide association studies (TWASs) in two populations of East Asia. GWAS summary statistics of 2,514 subjects (1,161 HCC cases and 1,353 controls) from the Chinese Qidong cohort and 161,323 subjects (2,122 HCC cases and 159,201 controls) from the BioBank Japan project were used to conduct TWAS analysis. The single-tissue and cross-tissue TWAS approaches were both used to detect the association between susceptible genes and the risk of HCC. TWAS identified genes were further annotated by Metascape, UALCAN, GEPIA2, and DepMap. We identified 22 novel genes at 16 independent loci significantly associated with HCC risk after Bonferroni correction. Of these, 13 genes were located in novel regions. Besides, we found 83 genes overlapped in the Chinese and Japanese cohorts with P < 0.05, of which, three genes (NUAK2, HLA-DQA1, and ATP6V1G2) were discerned by both single-tissue and cross-tissue TWAS approaches. Among the genes identified through TWAS, a significant proportion of them exhibit a credible role in HCC biology, such as FAM96B, HSPA5, POLRMT, MPHOSPH10, and RABL2A. HLA-DQA1, NUAK2, and HSPA5 associated with the process of carcinogenesis in HCC as previously reported. Our findings highlight the value of leveraging the gene expression data to identify new candidate genes beyond the GWAS associations and could further provide a genetic insight for the biology of HCC.",11153834
"OMIM 273750 (3-M) syndrome is a rare cause of severe short stature with variable dysmorphic features caused by pathogenic variants in several genes including cullin7 gene (CUL7). Hypogonadism and hypospadias have been described in only a few males. We report a patient with CUL7 pathogenic variant who had bifid scrotum and perineal hypospadias at birth. He entered puberty spontaneously at age 12 years and appropriately completed pubertal development by 15 years. Subsequently, a regression of testicular volumes, increased gonadotropin levels, and reduced (although normal) testosterone levels were observed. This case highlights the importance of careful pubertal monitoring as pubertal dysfunction may be associated with 3-M syndrome.",11154130
"Epigenetic control systems are based on chromatin modifications (DNA methylation, histone modifications and nucleosome positioning), which affect the local kinetics of gene expression. They play an important role in maintaining cell fate decisions, X inactivation and genomic imprinting. Aberrant chromatin states that are associated with a deleterious change in gene expression are called epimutations. An epimutation can be a primary epimutation that has occurred in the absence of any genetic change or a secondary epimutation that results from a mutation of a cis-acting regulatory element or trans-acting factor. Epimutations may play a causative role in disease, for example in imprinting disorders, or may be part of the pathogenetic mechanism as in the fragile X syndrome and in syndromes caused by a mutation affecting a chromatin modifier. For several diseases, DNA methylation testing is an important tool in the diagnostic work-up of patients.",11154187
"Leukemia is a heterogeneous group of life‐threatening malignant disorders of the hematopoietic system. Immunotherapy, radiotherapy, stem cell transplantation, targeted therapy, and chemotherapy are among the approved leukemia treatments. Unfortunately, therapeutic resistance, side effects, relapses, and long‐term sequelae occur in a significant proportion of patients and severely compromise the treatment efficacy. The development of novel approaches to improve outcomes is therefore an unmet need. Recently, novel leukemia drug discovery strategies, including targeted protein degradation, have shown potential to advance the field of personalized medicine for leukemia patients. Specifically, PROteolysis‐TArgeting Chimeras (PROTACs) are revolutionary compounds that allow the selective degradation of a protein by the ubiquitin–proteasome system. Developed against a wide range of cancer targets, they show promising potential in overcoming many of the drawbacks associated with conventional therapies. Following the exponential growth of antileukemic PROTACs, this article reviews PROTAC‐mediated degradation of leukemia‐associated targets. Chemical structures, in vitro and in vivo activities, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and clinical trials of PROTACs are critically discussed. Furthermore, advantages, challenges, and future perspectives of PROTACs in leukemia are covered, in order to understand the potential that these novel compounds may have as future drugs for leukemia treatment.",11154823
"Dynactin subunit 2 (DCTN2) has been reported to play a role in progression of several tumours; however, the involvement of DCTN2 in potential mechanism or the tumour immune microenvironment among various cancers still remains largely unknown. Therefore, the objective of this study was to comprehensively investigate the expression status and potential function of DCTN2 in various malignancies through different database, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas, the Genotype‐Tissue Expression and Gene Expression Omnimus databases. We discovered that DCTN2 expression was high in many type of tumours tissues compared to adjacent non‐tumour ones. High DCTN2 signified poor prognosis for patients with tumours. Additionally, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) analysis revealed that DCTN2 was positively correlated with oncogenic pathways, including cell cycle, tumour metastasis‐related pathway, while it was negatively with anti‐tumour immune signalling pathway, such as INF‐γ response. More importantly, we elucidated the functional impact of DCTN2 on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression and its underlying mechanisms. DCTN2 expression was much higher in HCC tissues than in adjacent non‐tumour tissues. Silencing DCTN2 dramatically suppressed the proliferative and metastasis capacities of tumour cell in vitro. Mechanistically, DCTN2 exerted tumour‐promoting effects by modulating the AKT signalling pathway. DCTN2 knockdown in HCC cells inhibited AKT phosphorylation and its downstream targets as well. Rescue experiments revealed that the anti‐tumour effects of DCTN2 knockdown were partially reversed upon AKT pathway activation. Overall, DCTN2 may be a potent biomarker signifying tumour prognosis and a promising therapeutic target for tumour treatment, particularly in HCC.",11154834
"Sex hormones and sex chromosomes play a vital role in cardiovascular disease. Testosterone plays a crucial role in men’s health. Lower testosterone level is associated with cardiovascular and cardiometabolic diseases, including inflammation, atherosclerosis, and type 2 diabetes. Testosterone replacement is beneficial or neutral to men’s cardiovascular health. Testosterone deficiency is associated with cardiovascular events. Testosterone supplementation to hypogonadal men improves libido, increases muscle strength, and enhances mood. We hypothesized that sex chromosomes (XX and XY) interaction with testosterone plays a role in arterial stiffening. We used four core genotype male mice to understand the inherent contribution of sex hormones and sex chromosome complement in arterial stiffening. Age-matched mice were either gonadal intact or castrated at eight weeks plus an additional eight weeks to clear endogenous sex hormones. This was followed by assessing blood pressure, pulse wave velocity, echocardiography, and ex vivo passive vascular mechanics. Arterial stiffening but not blood pressure was more significant in castrated than testes-intact mice independent of sex chromosome complement. Castrated mice showed a leftward shift in stress–strain curves and carotid wall thinning. Sex chromosome complement (XX) in the absence of testosterone increased collagen deposition in the aorta and Kdm6a gene expression. Testosterone deprivation increases arterial stiffening and vascular wall remodeling. Castration increases Col1α1 in male mice with XX sex chromosome complement. Our study shows decreased aortic contractile genes in castrated mice with XX than XY sex chromosomes.

"Network pharmacology and molecular docking methods were used in the present study to clarify the molecular mechanism of two traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions of climacteric syndrome. Based on oral availability and drug similarity, the main active components of Erzhi Pill and Erxian Decoction were screened through the platform of traditional Chinese medicine system pharmacology. The target database of climacteric syndrome was established by using GENECARD, OMIM, PharmGKB, Targets and Drugbank. The “component – target” network diagram was constructed using Cytoscape software (version 3.8.2). Topology analysis, module analysis, and GO and KEGG enrichment analyses were used to explore the core target and action pathway of Erzhi Pill-Erxian Decoction for treating climacteric syndrome of same disease with different treatments. There were 16 active components and 103 corresponding targets found in Erzhi Pill; 69 active components and 121 corresponding targets were found in Erxian Decoction; and 100 potential targets were found in Erzhi Pill and Erxian Decoction. Through network analysis, topology and module analysis, TP53, AKT1, Jun, ESR1, IL1B, CASP3, MMP9, PTGS2, HIF1A, MYC and EGFR could be considered as potential targets of the 2 prescriptions for alleviating climacteric syndrome. The effects of Erzhi pill and Erxian Decoction on climacteric syndrome are mainly in the pathway of lipid and atherosclerosis, AGE-RAGE signaling pathway and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway in diabetic complications. The active components in Erzhi Pill - Erxian Decoction, such as quercetin, show considerable potential as a candidate drug for the treatment of climacteric syndrome.",11155544
"The obesity epidemic continues to increase, with half of US women predicted to be obese by 2030. Women with obesity are at increased risk for not only cardiovascular and liver disease, but also reproductive disorders. Although mouse models are useful in studying the effects of obesity, there is inconsistency in obesity-induction methods, diet composition, and mouse strains, and studies using female mice are limited. In this study, we sought to compare the effects of a 45% high-fat diet (HFD) versus a 60% HFD on the uterine estrous cycle of nulligravid C57BL/6J mice. For 22 weeks, we placed a total of 20 mice on either a 60% HFD, 45% HFD, or each HFD-matched control diet (CD). Both HFDs produced significant weight gain, with 60% HFD and 45% HFD gaining significant weight after 2 weeks and 15 weeks, respectively. Additionally, both HFDs led to glucose intolerance, fatty liver, and adipocyte hypertrophy. Mice fed 60% HFD displayed hyperphagia in the first 12 weeks of HFD treatment. Moreover, 60% HFD-treated mice had a longer estrous cycle length and an increased percentage of estrus stage samplings compared to CD-treated mice. Estrous cycle stage-controlled 60% HFD-treated mice displayed an increased estrogen-to-progesterone ratio and decreased ovarian corpora lutea compared to CD-treated mice, which may underlie the observed estrous cycle differences. There was no significant difference between diets regarding endometrial morphology or the percent of endometrial CD45+ immune cells. Our results indicate that consideration is needed when selecting a HFD-induced obesity mouse model for research involving female reproductive health.",11156617
"During the process of transition from paediatric to adult health care, counselling concerning fertility is an important issue and is based mainly on serum markers of gonadal function. Here, we analysed these markers in adolescents with various underlying endocrine diseases at the time of transition. After reaching near adult height and late puberty (girls: bone age [BA] ≥14 years, and boys: BA ≥16 years), we assessed stages of puberty according to Tanner and measured testes or ovarian volumes and serum markers of gonadal function (anti‐Mullerian hormone [AMH], inhibin B, 17β‐estradiol, testosterone). One hundred and ten patients (56 females and 54 males) were included from May 2010 to March 2016 with multiple pituitary hormone deficiency (MPHD; n = 17), growth hormone deficiency (GHD; n = 35), Turner syndrome (TS; n = 27), short stature after being born small for gestational age (SGA; n = 20) and Klinefelter syndrome (KS; n = 11). Female and male adolescents exhibited mature secondary sexual characteristics. The levels of serum inhibin B and AMH were lower in TS and female MPHD than in GHD and SGA, each independently (p < 0.05). The levels of serum AMH were higher whereas serum inhibin B were lower in male MPHD and KS (p < 0.05). Ovary volumes were significantly smaller in patients with TS, and testicular volumes were smaller in patients with KS. After current established treatments with sex steroids, the development of secondary sexual characteristics was mature. However, impaired markers of fertility have been identified in patients with TS, KS and MPHD, reflecting gonadal dysgenesis in TS and KS, but gonadal immaturity in MPHD as gonadal gonadotropin stimulation is lacking throughout development. Consequently, in patients with MPHD, these markers cannot reliably predict individual fertility, which warrants consideration and incorporation in future treatment concepts.",11157144
"Endometriosis is a common gynecological disease affecting women of reproductive age. Patients with endometriosis frequently experience severe chronic pain and have higher chances to experience infertility. Progesterone resistance is a major problem that develops during the medical treatment of endometriosis, which often leads to treatment failure of hormonal therapies. Previous studies indicated that the dysregulation of progesterone receptors (PR) is the primary factor leading to progesterone resistance in endometriosis. This review article systematically reviewed and summarized findings extracted from previously published papers available on PubMed, encompassing both experimental studies and clinical trials. Various determinants influencing PR expression in endometriosis have been identified, including the environmental toxins, microRNAs, cell signaling pathways, genetic mutations, and the pro‐inflammatory cytokines. The selective estrogen/progesterone receptor modulators have emerged as novel therapeutic approaches for treating endometriosis, offering potential improvements in overcoming progesterone resistance. Concerns and limitations persist despite the newly developed drugs. Therefore, studies on unraveling new therapeutic targets based on the molecular mechanisms of progesterone resistance is warranted for the development potential alternatives to overcome hormonal treatment failure in endometriosis.",11157498
"Studies evaluating genetic sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) in Hispanic and Latino populations using genomic technologies are lacking. Recent data has shown that Hispanic and Latino children display lower genetic diagnostic rates despite similar prevalence rates of SNHL to their Asian and White counterparts, thus negatively affecting their clinical care. Our objective was to determine the genetic contribution to SNHL in a population of Mexican children undergoing evaluation for cochlear implantation. Pediatric patients from Mexico with severe to profound SNHL undergoing evaluation for cochlear implantation were recruited. Exome sequencing (ES) or hearing loss gene panel testing was performed. Variant pathogenicity was established in accordance to criteria established by the American College of Medical Genetics, and variants of interest were clinically confirmed via CLIA certified laboratory. Genetic evaluation was completed for 30 Mexican children with severe to profound SNHL. A genetic cause was identified for 47% (14) of probands, and 7% (2) probands had an inconclusive result. Of the diagnoses, 10 (71%) were syndromic or likely syndromic, and 4 (29%) were nonsyndromic. Eight probands (80% of all syndromic diagnoses) were diagnosed with a syndromic form of hearing loss that mimics a nonsyndromic clinical presentation at a young age and so could not be suspected based on clinical evaluation alone without genetic testing. This is the largest study to date to use comprehensive genomic testing for the evaluation of Mexican children with severe to profound SNHL. A significant proportion of children in this cohort were diagnosed with syndromic hearing loss. Future study in a larger cohort of Mexican children with varying degrees of hearing loss is required to improve the efficacy of genetic testing and timely medical intervention within these ethnically diverse populations. Level 4 (cohort study).",11160157
"Poly (ADP- ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) has been increasingly adopted for metastatic castration-resistance prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients with homologous recombination repair deficiency (HRD). However, it is unclear which PARPi is optimal in mCRPC patients with HRD in 2nd -line setting. We conducted a systematic review of trials regarding PARPi- based therapies on mCRPC in 2nd -line setting and performed a Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA). Radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) was assessed as primary outcome. PSA response and adverse events (AEs) were evaluated as secondary outcomes. Subgroup analyses were performed according to specific genetic mutation. Four RCTs comprised of 1024 patients (763 harbored homologous recombination repair (HRR) mutations) were identified for quantitative analysis. Regarding rPFS, olaparib monotherapy, rucaparib and cediranib plus olaparib showed significant improvement compared with ARAT. Olaparib plus cediranib had the highest surface under cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) scores (87.5%) for rPFS, followed by rucaparib, olaparib and olaparib plus abiraterone acetate prednisone. For patients with BRCA 1/2 mutations, olaparib associated with the highest probability (98.1%) of improved rPFS. For patients with BRCA-2 mutations, olaparib and olaparib plus cediranib had similar efficacy. However, neither olaparib nor rucaparib showed significant superior effectiveness to androgen receptor-axis-targeted therapy (ARAT) in patients with ATM mutations. For safety, olaparib showed significantly lower ≥ 3 AE rate compared with cediranib plus olaparib (RR: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.51, 0.97), while olaparib plus cediranib was associated with the highest risk of all-grade AE. PARPi-based therapy showed considerable efficacy for mCRPC patients with HRD in 2nd -line setting. However, patients should be treated accordingly based on their genetic background as well as the efficacy and safety of the selected regimen. : CRD42023454079.

"The potential anti-cancer effect of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) monomers has been widely studied due to their advantages of well-defined structure, clear therapeutic effects, and easy quality control during the manufacturing process. However, clinical trial information on these monomers is scarce, resulting in a lack of knowledge regarding the research progress, efficacy, and adverse reactions at the clinical stage. Therefore, this study systematically reviewed the clinical trials on the anti-cancer effect of TCM monomers registered in the Clinicaltrials.gov website before 2023.4.30, paying special attention to the trials on tumors, aiming to explore the research results and development prospects in this field. A total of 1982 trials were started using 69 of the 131 TCM monomers. The number of clinical trials performed each year showed an overall upward trend. However, only 26 monomers entered into 519 interventional anti-tumor trials, with vinblastine (194, 37.38%) and camptothecin (146, 28.13%) being the most used. A total of 45 tumors were studied in these 519 trials, with lymphoma (112, 21.58%) being the most frequently studied. Clinical trials are also unevenly distributed across locations and sponsors/collaborators. The location and the sponsor/collaborator with the highest number of performed trials were the United States (651,32.85%) and NIH (77). Therefore, China and its institutions still have large room for progress in promoting TCM monomers in anti-tumor clinical trials. In the next step, priority should be given to the improvement of the research and development ability of domestic enterprises, universities and other institutions, using modern scientific and technological means to solve the problems of poor water solubility and strong toxic and side effects of monomers, so as to promote the clinical research of TCM monomers.",11162644
"Kabuki syndrome (KS) is associated with congenital hyperinsulinism (HI). To characterize the clinical and molecular features of HI in children with KS. Retrospective cohort study of children with KS and HI evaluated between 1998 and 2023. The Congenital Hyperinsulinism Center of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Thirty-three children with KS and HI. HI presentation, treatment, course, and genotype. Hypoglycemia was recognized on the first day of life in 25 children (76%). Median age at HI diagnosis was 1.8 months (interquartile range [IQR], 0.6-6.1 months). Median age at KS diagnosis was 5 months (IQR, 2-14 months). Diagnosis of HI preceded KS diagnosis in 20 children (61%). Twenty-four children (73%) had a pathogenic variant in KMT2D, 5 children (15%) had a pathogenic variant in KDM6A, and 4 children (12%) had a clinical diagnosis of KS. Diazoxide trial was conducted in 25 children, 92% of whom were responsive. HI treatment was discontinued in 46% of the cohort at median age 2.8 years (IQR, 1.3-5.7 years). Hypoglycemia was recognized at birth in most children with KS and HI, but HI diagnosis was often delayed. HI was effectively managed with diazoxide in most children. In contrast to prior reports, the frequency of variants in KMT2D and KDM6A were similar to their overall prevalence in individuals with KS. Children diagnosed with KS should undergo evaluation for HI, and, because KS features may not be recognized in infancy, KMT2D and KDM6A should be included in the genetic evaluation of HI.",11163021
"Borderline ovarian tumours (BOTs) show intriguing characteristics distinguishing them from other ovarian tumours. The aim of the systematic review was to analyse the spectrum of molecular changes found in BOTs and discuss their significance in the context of the overall therapeutic approach. The systematic review included articles published between 2000 and 2023 in the databases: PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane. After a detailed analysis of the available publications, we qualified for the systematic review: 28 publications on proto-oncogenes: BRAF, KRAS, NRAS, ERBB2, and PIK3CA, 20 publications on tumour suppressor genes: BRCA1/2, ARID1A, CHEK2, PTEN, 4 on adhesion molecules: CADM1, 8 on proteins: B-catenin, claudin-1, and 5 on glycoproteins: E-Cadherin. In addition, in the further part of the systematic review, we included eight publications on microsatellite instability and three describing loss of heterozygosity in BOT. Molecular changes found in BOTs can vary on a case-by-case basis, identifying carcinogenic mutations through molecular analysis and developing targeted therapies represent significant advancements in the diagnosis and treatment of ovarian malignancies. Molecular studies have contributed significantly to our understanding of BOT pathogenesis, but substantial research is still required to elucidate the relationship between ovarian neoplasms and extraneous disease, identify accurate prognostic indicators, and develop targeted therapeutic approaches.",11163159
