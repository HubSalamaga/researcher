"RNA binding proteins play essential roles in coordinating germline gene expression and development in all organisms. Here, we report that loss of ADR-2, a member of the Adenosine DeAminase acting on RNA (ADAR) family of RNA binding proteins and the sole adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing enzyme in C. elegans, can improve fertility in multiple genetic backgrounds. First, we show that loss of RNA editing by ADR-2 restores normal embryo production to subfertile animals that transgenically express a vitellogenin (yolk protein) fusion to green fluorescent protein. Using this phenotype, a high-throughput screen was designed to identify RNA binding proteins that when depleted yield synthetic phenotypes with loss of adr-2. The screen uncovered a genetic interaction between ADR-2 and SQD-1, a member of the heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) family of RNA binding proteins. Microscopy, reproductive assays, and high-throughput sequencing reveal that sqd-1 is essential for the onset of oogenesis and oogenic gene expression in young adult animals, and that loss of adr-2 can counteract the effects of loss of sqd-1 on gene expression and rescue the switch from spermatogenesis to oogenesis. Together, these data demonstrate that ADR-2 can contribute to the suppression of fertility and suggest novel roles for both RNA editing-dependent and independent mechanisms in regulating embryogenesis.",10635048,0.6,0
"Tumor biomarkers, the substances which are produced by tumors or the body’s responses to tumors during tumorigenesis and progression, have been demonstrated to possess critical and encouraging value in screening and early diagnosis, prognosis prediction, recurrence detection, and therapeutic efficacy monitoring of cancers. Over the past decades, continuous progress has been made in exploring and discovering novel, sensitive, specific, and accurate tumor biomarkers, which has significantly promoted personalized medicine and improved the outcomes of cancer patients, especially advances in molecular biology technologies developed for the detection of tumor biomarkers. Herein, we summarize the discovery and development of tumor biomarkers, including the history of tumor biomarkers, the conventional and innovative technologies used for biomarker discovery and detection, the classification of tumor biomarkers based on tissue origins, and the application of tumor biomarkers in clinical cancer management. In particular, we highlight the recent advancements in biomarker-based anticancer-targeted therapies which are emerging as breakthroughs and promising cancer therapeutic strategies. We also discuss limitations and challenges that need to be addressed and provide insights and perspectives to turn challenges into opportunities in this field. Collectively, the discovery and application of multiple tumor biomarkers emphasized in this review may provide guidance on improved precision medicine, broaden horizons in future research directions, and expedite the clinical classification of cancer patients according to their molecular biomarkers rather than organs of origin.",11102923,0.1,0.05
"Miscarriage is a frustrating complication of pregnancy that is common among women of reproductive age. Insufficient decidualization which not only impairs embryo implantation but disturbs fetomaternal immune-tolerance, has been widely regarded as a major cause of miscarriage; however, the underlying mechanisms resulting in decidual impairment are largely unknown. With informed consent, decidual tissue from patients with spontaneous abortion or normal pregnant women was collected to detect the expression profile of UCHL1. Human endometrial stromal cells (HESCs) were used to explore the roles of UCHL1 in decidualization and dNK modulation, as well as the mechanisms involved. C57/BL6 female mice (7–10 weeks old) were used to construct pregnancy model or artificially induced decidualization model to evaluate the effect of UCHL1 on mice decidualization and pregnancy outcome. The Ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCHL1), as a deubiquitinating enzyme, was significantly downregulated in decidua from patients with miscarriage, along with impaired decidualization and decreased dNKs. Blockage of UCHL1 led to insufficient decidualization and resultant decreased expression of cytokines CXCL12, IL-15, TGF-β which were critical for generation of decidual NK cells (dNKs), whereas UCHL1 overexpression enhanced decidualization accompanied by increase in dNKs. Mechanistically, the promotion of UCHL1 on decidualization was dependent on its deubiquitinating activity, and intervention of UCHL1 inhibited the activation of JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway, resulting in aberrant decidualization and decreased production of cytokines associated with dNKs modulation. Furthermore, we found that inhibition of UCHL1 also disrupted the decidualization in mice and eventually caused adverse pregnancy outcome. UCHL1 plays significant roles in decidualization and dNKs modulation during pregnancy in both humans and mice. Its deficiency indicates a poor pregnancy outcome due to defective decidualization, making UCHL1 a potential target for the diagnosis and treatment of miscarriage.

"We present a unique case of hypokalemic thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (TPP) in an adolescent girl in North America. TPP is a rare but dangerous complication seen in thyrotoxic patients characterized by hypokalemia and acute proximal symmetric lower-extremity weakness. It is an especially rare phenomenon in pediatrics, with roughly 20 case reports described in adolescents worldwide; the majority are male. Our patient is a 14-year-old Asian girl with biochemical hyperandrogenism and known Graves disease who presented with an acute episode of lower-extremity weakness after eating a carbohydrate-rich meal. Laboratory workup revealed hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, an undetectable thyrotropin, and hyperthyroxinemia. Electrolyte derangements responded well to supplementation, and the muscle weakness resolved with electrolyte normalization. Following improvement in thyroid function, the patient underwent thyroidectomy for definitive management of Graves disease. As TPP is potentially exacerbated by higher androgen and insulin levels, we suspect that with increasing rates of obesity and polycystic ovary syndrome, the incidence of TPP among adolescents may increase. It is therefore critically important that there is awareness and recognition of this serious diagnosis among all health care providers.",11104527,0.15,0
"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive brain tumor in adults. To identify genes differentially required for the viability of GBM stem-like cells (GSCs), we performed functional genomic lethality screens comparing GSCs and control human neural stem cells. Among top-scoring hits in a subset of GBM cells was the F-box-containing gene FBXO42, which was also predicted to be essential in ∼15% of cell lines derived from a broad range of cancers. Mechanistic studies revealed that, in sensitive cells, FBXO42 activity prevents chromosome alignment defects, mitotic cell cycle arrest and cell death. The cell cycle arrest, but not the cell death, triggered by FBXO42 inactivation could be suppressed by brief exposure to a chemical inhibitor of Mps1, a key spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) kinase. FBXO42’s cancer-essential function requires its F-box and Kelch domains, which are necessary for FBXO42’s substrate recognition and targeting by SCF (SKP1–CUL1–F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complex. However, none of FBXO42’s previously proposed targets, including ING4, p53 and RBPJ, were responsible for the observed phenotypes. Instead, our results suggest that FBOX42 alters the activity of one or more proteins that perturb chromosome–microtubule dynamics in cancer cells, which in turn leads to induction of the SAC and cell death.",11106029,0.4,0.3
"Infertility is defined as the failure to achieve pregnancy after one year of unprotected intercourse within a marital relationship. Approximately 10%–15% of couples worldwide experience infertility issues, with nearly half of these cases attributed to male factors. Among men with unexplained infertility, genetic mutations have been identified as a potential cause. Studies have indicated that mutations affecting the function of the protein encoded by the ACTL9 gene may play a role in male infertility. The purpose of this research was to identify mutations in the ACTL9 gene associated with male infertility in a sample of 40 infertile men with unknown causes. Genomic DNA extraction and PCR amplification were carried out on samples from each individual. The genetic material was then analyzed using Sanger sequencing, followed by bioinformatics and segregation analysis to determine the potential effects of the observed variations. A novel genetic variant, c.376G>A (p.Glu126Lys), was identified in an infertile male individual, representing a previously unreported finding that was validated through segregation analyses. This specific variant induces a change from glutamate to lysine at the amino acid level by replacing the nucleotide G with A in the genomic DNA sequence, consequently impacting the secondary structure and function of the protein. The conclusive analysis of the procedure indicated that this alteration has the potential to interfere with the process of fertilization, ultimately resulting in the complete failure of fertilization (TFF) and causing male infertility.",11106586,0.9,0.35
"Immunotherapy represented by anti-PD-(L)1 and anti-CTLA-4 inhibitors has revolutionized cancer treatment, but challenges related to resistance and toxicity still remain. Due to the advancement of immuno-oncology, an increasing number of novel immunoregulatory targets and mechanisms are being revealed, with relevant therapies promising to improve clinical immunotherapy in the foreseeable future. Therefore, comprehending the larger picture is important. In this review, we analyze and summarize the current landscape of preclinical and translational mechanistic research, drug development, and clinical trials that brought about next-generation pharmacological immunoregulatory anti-cancer agents and drug candidates beyond classical immune checkpoint inhibitors. Along with further clarification of cancer immunobiology and advances in antibody engineering, agents targeting additional inhibitory immune checkpoints, including LAG-3, TIM-3, TIGIT, CD47, and B7 family members are becoming an important part of cancer immunotherapy research and discovery, as are structurally and functionally optimized novel anti-PD-(L)1 and anti-CTLA-4 agents and agonists of co-stimulatory molecules of T cells. Exemplified by bispecific T cell engagers, newly emerging bi-specific and multi-specific antibodies targeting immunoregulatory molecules can provide considerable clinical benefits. Next-generation agents also include immune epigenetic drugs and cytokine-based therapeutics. Cell therapies, cancer vaccines, and oncolytic viruses are not covered in this review. This comprehensive review might aid in further development and the fastest possible clinical adoption of effective immuno-oncology modalities for the benefit of patients.",11109181,0.3,0
"The presence of cancer cachexia is a significant adverse prognostic indicator in patients with malignant tumors. Cancer cachexia is a multifactorial syndrome characterized by a constant loss of skeletal muscles with or without a loss of weight, leading to immune dysfunction. We performed a retrospective study to investigate the influence of cachexia on the immunotherapy efficacy and prognosis for malignant tumors of the digestive system. The present study adopts a cross‐sectional design. The prognosis data of patients with advanced cancer of the digestive system who received immunotherapy from September 2021 to December 2022 were analyzed. Cachexia was calculated using the change of the area of the psoas major muscle (PMMA) or the weight. We measured the change at the beginning of immunotherapy and at least 2 cycles afterward. The participants were categorized into the cachexia group and control group based on the evaluation criteria. Kaplan–Meier and Log‐rank methods were used for survival analysis. Cox proportional hazard model as a method to assess the contribution of different clinical factors to overall survival (OS) and progression‐free survival (PFS). A total number of 98 patients, including esophageal carcinoma (4, 4%), gastric (36, 37%), colorectal (51, 52%), and other cancer types (7, 7%), were enrolled. Fifty‐four patients were diagnosed with non‐cancer cachexia, and the cancer cachexia group included 44 patients. The median PFS in the cachexia group was shorter than that in the control group (130 days vs. 212 days). Their difference was not significant (p = .321). The survival rate of the patients without cachexia was longer than of those with cachexia (p = .027). The level of albumin and the number of metastatic organs were related to PFS (p = .020, p = .029). The albumin level was significantly associated with the OS of patients (p = .003). The presence of cachexia was significantly associated with poor OS in patients with malignant tumors of the digestive system who received immunotherapy, not with PFS or the response to immunotherapy.",11110103,0.1,0.2
"Patients with spinal cord injury have a relatively high risk for bladder cancer and often complicated with bladder cancer in advanced stages, and the degree of aggressiveness of malignancy is high. Most of the literature is based on disease clinical features while, our study reviews the clinical characteristics and molecular mechanisms of spinal cord injury patients with bladder cancer, so that it might help clinicians better recognize and manage these patients. We searched PubMed, Web of Science and Embase, using retrieval type like (“Neurogenic Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction” OR “Spinal cord injury” OR “Spinal Cord Trauma”) AND (“bladder cancer” OR “bladder neoplasm” OR “bladder carcinoma” OR “Urinary Bladder Neoplasms” OR “Bladder Tumor”). In Web of Science, the retrieval type was searched as “Topic”, and in PubMed and Embase, as “All Field”. The methodological quality of eligible studies and their risk of bias were assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. This article is registered in PROSPERO with the CBD number: CRD42024508514. In WOS, we searched 219 related papers, in PubMed, 122 and in Embase, 363. Thus, a total of 254 articles were included after passing the screening, within a time range between 1960 and 2023. A comprehensive analysis of the data showed that the mortality and incidence rates of bladder cancer in spinal cord injury patients were higher than that of the general population, and the most frequent pathological type was squamous cell carcinoma. In parallel to long-term urinary tract infection and indwelling catheterization, the role of molecules such as NO, MiR 1949 and Rb 1. was found to be crucial pathogenetically. This review highlights the risk of bladder cancer in SCI patients, comprehensively addressing the clinical characteristics and related molecular mechanisms. However, given that there are few studies on the molecular mechanisms of bladder cancer in spinal cord injury, further research is needed to expand the understanding of the disease.

"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic and recurrent condition affecting the gastrointestinal tract. Disturbed gut microbiota and abnormal bile acid (BA) metabolism are notable in IBD, suggesting a bidirectional relationship. Specifically, the diversity of the gut microbiota influences BA composition, whereas altered BA profiles can disrupt the microbiota. IBD patients often exhibit increased primary bile acid and reduced secondary bile acid concentrations due to a diminished bacteria population essential for BA metabolism. This imbalance activates BA receptors, undermining intestinal integrity and immune function. Consequently, targeting the microbiota-BA axis may rectify these disturbances, offering symptomatic relief in IBD. Here, the interplay between gut microbiota and bile acids (BAs) is reviewed, with a particular focus on the role of gut microbiota in mediating bile acid biotransformation, and contributions of the gut microbiota-BA axis to IBD pathology to unveil potential novel therapeutic avenues for IBD.",11110704,0.2,0.05
"We report the case of a 5-year-old boy diagnosed with congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 11-hydroxylase deficiency, revealed by disorders of sex development (DSD) and acute pulmonary edema due to severe hypertension. We considered the diagnosis based on biological and radiological examinations. The sociocultural background and the delayed diagnosis had a significant impact on the therapeutic decisions. All babies should be screened for 11 beta-hydroxylase deficiency, there should be specialized and interdisciplinary medical centers, and early detection is essential to avoiding serious complications of this disease.",11110861,0.15,0.05
"Dyskeratosis congenita (DKC) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by lacy reticular skin hyperpigmentation, bone marrow failure, nail dystrophy, and oral leukoplakia. To the best of our knowledge, only around 200 cases were reported in the medical literature, and in this report, we present another distinctive case from Syria. This case report describes a male patient with generalized reticular pigmentation and abnormal nails since childhood. The patient reported a history of recurrent urethral stenosis and corneal density. Dermoscopic examination revealed pigmented lines arranged in a netlike pattern. Histopathological findings were nonspecific. Hematological values were unremarkable. A contrast CT scan revealed changes in the bladder wall. The final diagnosis of Dyskeratosis Congenita was made based on the clinical criteria. This disorder can present with additional cutaneous manifestations and systemic complications. Treatment are generally prescribed to maintain bone marrow function, based on the fact that it is the major cause of death. Regular monitoring and screening for associated conditions are recommended.",11110863,0.15,0.05
"Spermatozoa cryopreservation has been practiced for decades and is a very useful technique for long-term preservation of sperm fertility. The capability for semen cryopreservation varies across species, seasons, latitudes, and even for different ejaculates from the same animal. This article summarizes research results on sperm cryotolerance biomarkers in several species, focusing on three areas: spermatozoa cryotolerance biomarkers, seminal plasma proteins cryotolerance biomarkers, and other cryotolerance biomarkers. We discovered that sperm cryoresistance biomarkers are primarily related to sperm plasma membrane stability, the presence of antioxidant substances in sperm or seminal plasma, sperm cell energy metabolism, water and small molecule transport channels in the sperm plasma membrane, and antistress substances in sperm or seminal plasma. The research conducted using diverse livestock models can be employed to enhance the basic and applied reproduction of other mammals through the study of sperm cryotolerance biomarkers, as well as the substantial similarities between livestock and other organisms, including endangered species."11111053,0,0.05
"Mitochondria are hubs of metabolic activity with a major role in ATP conversion by oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). The mammalian mitochondrial genome encodes 11 mRNAs encoding 13 OXPHOS proteins along with 2 rRNAs and 22 tRNAs, that facilitate their translation on mitoribosomes. Maintaining the internal production of core OXPHOS subunits requires modulation of the mitochondrial capacity to match the cellular requirements and correct insertion of particularly hydrophobic proteins into the inner mitochondrial membrane. The mitochondrial translation system is essential for energy production and defects result in severe, phenotypically diverse diseases, including mitochondrial diseases that typically affect postmitotic tissues with high metabolic demands. Understanding the complex mechanisms that underlie the pathologies of diseases involving impaired mitochondrial translation is key to tailoring specific treatments and effectively targeting the affected organs. Disease mutations have provided a fundamental, yet limited, understanding of mitochondrial protein synthesis, since effective modification of the mitochondrial genome has proven challenging. However, advances in next generation sequencing, cryoelectron microscopy, and multi-omic technologies have revealed unexpected and unusual features of the mitochondrial protein synthesis machinery in the last decade. Genome editing tools have generated unique models that have accelerated our mechanistic understanding of mitochondrial translation and its physiological importance. Here we review the most recent mouse models of disease pathogenesis caused by defects in mitochondrial protein synthesis and discuss their value for preclinical research and therapeutic development.",11112386,0,0.05
"Genetic diversity underpins evolutionary potential that is essential for the long‐term viability of wildlife populations. Captive populations harbor genetic diversity potentially lost in the wild, which could be valuable for release programs and genetic rescue. The Critically Endangered Arabian leopard (Panthera pardus nimr) has disappeared from most of its former range across the Arabian Peninsula, with fewer than 120 individuals left in the wild, and an additional 64 leopards in captivity. We (i) examine genetic diversity in the wild and captive populations to identify global patterns of genetic diversity and structure; (ii) estimate the size of the remaining leopard population across the Dhofar mountains of Oman using spatially explicit capture–recapture models on DNA and camera trap data, and (iii) explore the impact of genetic rescue using three complementary computer modeling approaches. We estimated a population size of 51 (95% CI 32–79) in the Dhofar mountains and found that 8 out of 25 microsatellite alleles present in eight loci in captive leopards were undetected in the wild. This includes two alleles present only in captive founders known to have been wild‐sourced from Yemen, which suggests that this captive population represents an important source for genetic rescue. We then assessed the benefits of reintroducing novel genetic diversity into the wild population as well as the risks of elevating the genetic load through the release of captive‐bred individuals. Simulations indicate that genetic rescue can improve the long‐term viability of the wild population by reducing its genetic load and realized load. The model also suggests that the genetic load has been partly purged in the captive population, potentially making it a valuable source population for genetic rescue. However, the greater loss of its genetic diversity could exacerbate genomic erosion of the wild population during a rescue program, and these risks and benefits should be carefully evaluated. An important next step in the recovery of the Arabian leopard is to empirically validate these conclusions, implement and monitor a genomics‐informed management plan, and optimize a strategy for genetic rescue as a tool to recover Arabia's last big cat.",11113348,0,0
"Heart failure is a leading cause of death in the elderly. Traditional Chinese medicine, a verified alternative therapeutic regimen, has been used to treat heart failure, which is less expensive and has fewer adverse effects. In this study, a total of 15 active ingredients of Astragalus membranaceus (Huangqi, HQ) were obtained; among them, Isorhamnetin, Quercetin, Calycosin, Formononetin, and Kaempferol were found to be linked to heart failure. Ang II significantly enlarged the cell size of cardiomyocytes, which could be partially reduced by Quercetin, Isorhamnetin, Calycosin, Kaempferol, or Formononetin. Ang II significantly up‐regulated ANP, BNP, β‐MHC, and CTGF expressions, whereas Quercetin, Isorhamnetin, Calycosin, Kaempferol or Formononetin treatment partially downregulated ANP, BNP, β‐MHC and CTGF expressions. Five active ingredients of HQ attenuated inflammation in Ang II‐induced cardiomyocytes by inhibiting the levels of TNF‐α, IL‐1β, IL‐18 and IL‐6. Molecular docking shows Isorhamnetin, Quercetin, Calycosin, Formononetin and Kaempferol can bind with its target protein ESR1 in a good bond by intermolecular force. Quercetin, Calycosin, Kaempferol or Formononetin treatment promoted the expression levels of ESR1 and phosphorylated ESR1 in Ang II‐stimulated cardiomyocytes; however, Isorhamnetin treatment had no effect on ESR1 and phosphorylated ESR1 expression levels. In conclusion, our results comprehensively illustrated the bioactives, potential targets, and molecular mechanism of HQ against heart failure. Isorhamnetin, Quercetin, Calycosin, Formononetin and Kaempferol might be the primary active ingredients of HQ, dominating its cardioprotective effects against heart failure through regulating ESR1 expression, which provided a basis for the clinical application of HQ to regulate cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure.",11114218,0.3,0
"Exportin‐1 (XPO1), a crucial protein regulating nuclear‐cytoplasmic transport, is frequently overexpressed in various cancers, driving tumor progression and drug resistance. This makes XPO1 an attractive therapeutic target. Over the past few decades, the number of available nuclear export‐selective inhibitors has been increasing. Only KPT‐330 (selinexor) has been successfully used for treating haematological malignancies, and KPT‐8602 (eltanexor) has been used for treating haematologic tumours in clinical trials. However, the use of nuclear export‐selective inhibitors for the inhibition of XPO1 expression has yet to be thoroughly investigated in clinical studies and therapeutic outcomes for solid tumours. We collected numerous literatures to explain the efficacy of XPO1 Inhibitors in preclinical and clinical studies of a wide range of solid tumours. In this review, we focus on the nuclear export function of XPO1 and results from clinical trials of its inhibitors in solid malignant tumours. We summarized the mechanism of action and therapeutic potential of XPO1 inhibitors, as well as adverse effects and response biomarkers. XPO1 inhibition has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy in the fight against cancer, offering a novel approach to targeting tumorigenic processes and overcoming drug resistance. SINE compounds have demonstrated efficacy in a wide range of solid tumours, and ongoing research is focused on optimizing their use, identifying response biomarkers, and developing effective combination therapies.

"Platelet‐to‐albumin ratio (PAR) is a new systemic inflammatory prognostic indicator associated with many inflammatory diseases. However, its role in radiation cystitis (RC) is obscure. This study aimed to explore whether PAR could be used as an effective parameter for predicting the RC risk in local advanced cervical cancer (CC) treated with radiotherapy. A total of 319 local advanced CC patients who received radical radiotherapy at Fujian Cancer Hospital were enrolled between December 2018 and January 2021. Demographics and clinical parameters were retrospectively analyzed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify the risk factors for RC. Backward and stepwise regression was applied to construct two monograms‐one with primary significant factors and the other with extra inflammatory biomarkers. A DeLong test was applied to compare the prediction abilities of two nomograms. Calibration curves and decision curve analysis (DCA) evaluated its prediction consistency, discrimination ability, and clinical net benefit. Univariate analysis showed that age, tumor size, stage, total radiation dose, pelvic radiation dose, Systemic Immune‐Inflammation Index (SII), platelet‐to‐lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and PAR were significantly associated with RC occurrence (all p < 0.05). Multivariate analyses indicated that age, tumor size, stage, total radiation dose, and PAR were independent factors (all p < 0.05). Then, the area under curve (AUC) value of the nomogramSII+PAR was higher (AUC = 0.774) compared to that of the baseline nomogram (AUC = 0.726) (p Delong = 0.02). Also, the five‐cross validation confirmed the stability of the nomogramSII+PAR. Moreover, the calibration curve and DCA exhibited the nomograms' good prediction consistency and clinical practicability. PAR and SII could be valued for CC patients who are treated with radiation therapy. The nomogram based on PAR and SII could stratify patients who need extra intervention and nursing care to prevent bladder radiation damage and improve patients' quality of life.",11117193,0.15,0.3

"MicroRNAs can interfere with protein function by suppressing their messenger RNA translation or the synthesis of its related factors. The function of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is essential to the proper formation and function of the nervous system and is seen to be regulated by many microRNAs. However, understanding how microRNAs influence BDNF actions within cells requires a wider comprehension of their integrative regulatory mechanisms. Aim: In this literature review, we have synthesized the evidence of microRNA regulation on BDNF in cells and tissues, and provided an analytical discussion about direct and indirect mechanisms that appeared to be involved in BDNF regulation by microRNAs. Methods: Searches were conducted on PubMed.gov using the terms “BDNF” AND “MicroRNA” and “brain-derived neurotrophic factor” AND “MicroRNA”, updated on 1 September 2023. Papers without open access were requested from the authors. One hundred and seventy-one papers were included for review and discussion. Results and Discussion: The local regulation of BDNF by microRNAs involves a complex interaction between a series of microRNAs with target proteins that can either inhibit or enhance BDNF expression, at the core of cell metabolism. Therefore, understanding this homeostatic balance provides resources for the future development of vector-delivery-based therapies for the neuroprotective effects of BDNF.",11119608,0.1,0
"Keratin-positive giant cell-rich tumor (KPGCT) is a recently described mesenchymal tumor characterized by keratin-positive cells and recurrent HMGA2–NCOR2 fusions. Due to the rarity of the disease, KPGCT is poorly understood. Our objective with this review article is to provide a comprehensive reference, offer valuable insights into the clinicopathological characteristics and pathogenesis, and summarize current therapeutic options for KPGCT. Keratin-positive giant cell-rich tumor (KPGCT) is an extremely rare and recently described mesenchymal neoplasm that occurs in both soft tissue and bone, frequently found in young women. It has locally recurrent potential if incompletely excised but low risk for metastasis. KPGCT is histologically similar to conventional giant cell tumors of soft tissue but shows the presence of keratin-positive mononuclear cells. Interestingly, KPGCT also shares some morphological features with xanthogranulomatous epithelial tumors. These two tumors have recently been shown to harbor an HMGA2–NCOR2 fusion, arguing in favor of a single entity. Surgery is the treatment of choice for localized KPGCT. Therapeutic options for advanced or metastatic disease are unknown. This review provides an overview of the current knowledge on the clinical presentation, pathogenesis, histopathology, and treatment of KPGCT. In addition, we will discuss the differential diagnosis of this emerging entity.",11120402,0.15,0.05

"Selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) are an appealing carrier for the targeted delivery. The selenium nanoparticles are gaining global attention because of the potential therapeutic applications in several diseases e.g., rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), asthma, liver, and various autoimmune disorders like psoriasis, cancer, diabetes, and a variety of infectious diseases. Despite the fact still there is no recent literature that summarises the therapeutic applications of SeNPs. There are some challenges that need to be addressed like finding targets for SeNPs in various diseases, and the various functionalization techniques utilized to increase SeNP’s stability while facilitating wide drug-loaded SeNP distribution to tumor areas and preventing off-target impacts need to focus on understanding more about the therapeutic aspects for better understanding the science behind it. Keeping that in mind we have focused on this gap and try to summarize all recent key targeted therapies for SeNPs in cancer treatment and the numerous functionalization strategies. We have also focused on recent advancements in SeNP functionalization methodologies and mechanisms for biomedical applications, particularly in anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and anti-infection therapeutics. Based on our observation we found that SeNPs could potentially be useful in suppressing viral epidemics, like the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, in complement to their antibacterial and antiparasitic uses. SeNPs are significant nanoplatforms with numerous desirable properties for clinical translation.",11127871,0.15,0.05
"What is the effect of the chemical in vitro activation (cIVA) protocol compared with fragmentation only (Frag, also known as mechanical IVA) on gene expression, follicle activation and growth in human ovarian tissue in vitro? Although histological assessment shows that cIVA significantly increases follicle survival and growth compared to Frag, both protocols stimulate extensive and nearly identical transcriptomic changes in cultured tissue compared to freshly collected ovarian tissue, including marked changes in energy metabolism and inflammatory responses. Treatments based on cIVA of the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway in ovarian tissue followed by auto-transplantation have been administered to patients with refractory premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) and resulted in live births. However, comparable effects with mere tissue fragmentation have been shown, questioning the added value of chemical stimulation that could potentially activate oncogenic responses. Fifty-nine ovarian cortical biopsies were obtained from consenting women undergoing elective caesarean section (C-section). The samples were fragmented for culture studies. Half of the fragments were exposed to bpV (HOpic)+740Y-P (Frag+cIVA group) during the first 24 h of culture, while the other half were cultured with medium only (Frag group). Subsequently, both groups were cultured with medium only for an additional 6 days. Tissue and media samples were collected for histological, transcriptomic, steroid hormone, and cytokine/chemokine analyses at various time points. Effects on follicles were evaluated by counting and scoring serial sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin before and after the 7-day culture. Follicle function was assessed by quantification of steroids by ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry at different time points. Cytokines and chemokines were measured by multiplex assay. Transcriptomic effects were measured by RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) of the tissue after the initial 24-h culture. Selected differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were validated by quantitative PCR and immunofluorescence in cultured ovarian tissue as well as in KGN cell (human ovarian granulosa-like tumor cell line) culture experiments. Compared to the Frag group, the Frag+cIVA group exhibited a significantly higher follicle survival rate, increased numbers of secondary follicles, and larger follicle sizes. Additionally, the tissue in the Frag+cIVA group produced less dehydroepiandrosterone compared to Frag. Cytokine measurement showed a strong inflammatory response at the start of the culture in both groups. The RNA-seq data revealed modest differences between the Frag+cIVA and Frag groups, with only 164 DEGs identified using a relaxed cut-off of false discovery rate (FDR) <0.1. Apart from the expected PI3K–protein kinase B (Akt) pathway, cIVA also regulated pathways related to hypoxia, cytokines, and inflammation. In comparison to freshly collected ovarian tissue, gene expression in general was markedly affected in both the Frag+cIVA and Frag groups, with a total of 3119 and 2900 DEGs identified (FDR < 0.001), respectively. The top enriched gene sets in both groups included several pathways known to modulate follicle growth such as mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)C1 signaling. Significant changes compared to fresh tissue were also observed in the expression of genes encoding for steroidogenesis enzymes and classical granulosa cell markers in both groups. Intriguingly, we discovered a profound upregulation of genes related to glycolysis and its upstream regulator in both Frag and Frag+cIVA groups, and these changes were further boosted by the cIVA treatment. Cell culture experiments confirmed glycolysis-related genes as direct targets of the cIVA drugs. In conclusion, cIVA enhances follicle growth, as expected, but the mechanisms may be more complex than PI3K–Akt–mTOR alone, and the impact on function and quality of the follicles after the culture period remains an open question. Data were deposited in the GEO data base, accession number GSE234765. The code for sequencing analysis can be found in https://github.com/tialiv/IVA_project. Similar to the published IVA protocols, the first steps in our study were performed in an in vitro culture model where the ovarian tissue was isolated from the regulation of hypothalamic–pituitary–ovarian axis. Further in vivo experiments will be needed, for example in xeno-transplantation models, to explore the long-term impacts of the discovered effects. The tissue collected from patients undergoing C-section may not be comparable to tissue of patients with POI. The general impact of fragmentation and short (24 h) in vitro culture on gene expression in ovarian tissue far exceeded the effects of cIVA. Yet, follicle growth was stimulated by cIVA, which may suggest effects on specific cell populations that may be diluted in bulk RNA-seq. Nevertheless, we confirmed the impact of cIVA on glycolysis using a cell culture model, suggesting impacts on cellular signaling beyond the PI3K pathway. The profound changes in inflammation and glycolysis following fragmentation and culture could contribute to follicle activation and loss in ovarian tissue culture, as well as in clinical applications, such as fertility preservation by ovarian tissue auto-transplantation.

"Alström syndrome is a form of inherited obesity caused by a single gene abnormality and is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. It is characterised by a variety of clinical manifestations, including progressive visual and hearing impairment, type 2 diabetes mellitus, dilated cardiomyopathy, and hepatic and renal dysfunction, in addition to obesity. Recent insights underline the pivotal involvement of the disease-associated gene (ALMS1) in cilia formation and function, leading to the classification of its clinical manifestations as a ciliopathy. This review delineates the diverse clinical indicators defining the syndrome and elucidates its pathological underpinnings.",11128078,0.35,0.05
"In recent decades, antibodies have emerged as indispensable therapeutics for combating diseases, particularly viral infections. However, their development has been hindered by limited structural information and labor-intensive engineering processes. Fortunately, significant advancements in deep learning methods have facilitated the precise prediction of protein structure and function by leveraging co-evolution information from homologous proteins. Despite these advances, predicting the conformation of antibodies remains challenging due to their unique evolution and the high flexibility of their antigen-binding regions. Here, to address this challenge, we present the Bio-inspired Antibody Language Model (BALM). This model is trained on a vast dataset comprising 336 million 40% nonredundant unlabeled antibody sequences, capturing both unique and conserved properties specific to antibodies. Notably, BALM showcases exceptional performance across four antigen-binding prediction tasks. Moreover, we introduce BALMFold, an end-to-end method derived from BALM, capable of swiftly predicting full atomic antibody structures from individual sequences. Remarkably, BALMFold outperforms those well-established methods like AlphaFold2, IgFold, ESMFold and OmegaFold in the antibody benchmark, demonstrating significant potential to advance innovative engineering and streamline therapeutic antibody development by reducing the need for unnecessary trials. The BALMFold structure prediction server is freely available at https://beamlab-sh.com/models/BALMFold.",11128484,0,0
"BRAFV600E is the most common genetic mutation in differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) occurring in 60% of patients and drives malignant tumour cell phenotypes including proliferation, metastasis and immune‐escape. BRAFV600E‐mutated papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) also displays greatly reduced expression of thyroid differentiation markers, thus tendency to radioactive iodine (RAI) refractory and poor prognosis. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms and main oncogenic events underlying BRAFV600E will guide future therapy development. Bioinformatics and clinical specimen analyses, genetic manipulation of BRAFV600E‐induced PTC model, functional and mechanism exploration guided with transcriptomic screening, as well as systematic rescue experiments were applied to investigate miR‐31 function within BRAFV600E‐induced thyroid cancer development. Besides, nanoparticles carrying miR‐31 antagomirs were testified to alleviate 131I iodide therapy on PTC models. We identify miR‐31 as a significantly increased onco‐miR in BRAFV600E‐associated PTC that promotes tumour progression, metastasis and RAI refractoriness via sustained Wnt/β‐catenin signalling. Mechanistically, highly activated BRAF/MAPK pathway induces miR‐31 expression via c‐Jun‐mediated transcriptional regulation across in vitro and transgenic mouse models. MiR‐31 in turn facilitates β‐catenin stabilisation via directly repressing tumour suppressors CEBPA and DACH1, which direct the expression of multiple essential Wnt/β‐catenin pathway inhibitors. Genetic functional assays showed that thyroid‐specific knockout of miR‐31 inhibited BRAFV600E‐induced PTC progression, and strikingly, enhanced expression of sodium‐iodide symporter and other thyroid differentiation markers, thus promoted 131I uptake. Nanoparticle‐mediated application of anti‐miR‐31 antagomirs markedly elevated radio‐sensitivity of BRAFV600E‐induced PTC tumours to 131I therapy, and efficiently suppressed tumour progression in the pre‐clinical mouse model. Our findings elucidate a novel BRAF/MAPK‐miR‐31‐Wnt/β‐catenin regulatory mechanism underlying clinically BRAFV600E‐associated DTC tumourigenesis and dedifferentiation, also highlight a potential adjuvant therapeutic strategy for advanced DTC.",11128713,0.4,0
"A mutation in the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (STAR) gene, which encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in steroid hormone synthesis, causes a severe form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) known as lipoid CAH (LCAH). LCAH presents with primary adrenal insufficiency (PAI) as well as atypical genitalia. Individuals with LCAH require adrenal steroid hormone supplements for survival. Masculinization in males with STAR deficiency varies from incomplete to normal virilization. Radiological examinations reveal enlarged and lipid-laden adrenals. A 10-year-old boy born of second-degree consanguinity presented with weight gain and hyperpigmentation for 1 year. He was diagnosed with PAI at age 7 months and treated with hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone. Dynamic adrenal gland testing revealed undetectable hormone reserves. Imaging detected hypoplastic adrenals and a small testis with testicular adrenal rests (TART). Genetic analysis indicated a novel homozygous pathogenic variant of STAR in exon 7, c.814C > G(pArg272Gly) associated with LCAH (OMIM No. 201710). Testing revealed that asymptomatic family members and relatives were heterozygotes for the variant. The patient was diagnosed with nonclassic LCAH with hypoplastic adrenals and TART. Adequate hormone supplementation resulted in TART regression. This genetic variation is reported for the first time.",11128940,0.6,0.25
"Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome, an extremely rare genetic disorder, is characterized by the development of fibrofolliculomas, lung cysts and subsequent recurrent pneumothorax, and kidney neoplasia. This report highlights the case of a 56-year-old female with a history of right vestibular schwannoma status post stereotactic radiotherapy and vulva bartholin’s gland carcinoma who was initially evaluated by primary care for a 6-month history of intermittent, red, raised, widespread rash accompanied by fever, chills, and body aches. A punch biopsy of the rash was performed, which was notable for an urticarial tissue reaction with focal changes of leukocytoclasia and negative direct immunofluorescence. Laboratory tests, which included an autoimmune genetic and periodic fever panel, were unremarkable. Whole genome sequencing returned positive for a pathogenic variant in folliculin gene, consistent with a diagnosis of Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome.",11129575,0.55,0.55
"T cells are crucial for adaptive immunity to regulate proper immune response and immune homeostasis. T cell development occurs in the thymus and mainly differentiates into CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets. Upon stimulation, naive T cells differentiate into distinct CD4+ helper and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, which mediate immunity homeostasis and defend against pathogens or tumours. Trace elements are minimal yet essential components of human body that cannot be overlooked, and they participate in enzyme activation, DNA synthesis, antioxidant defence, hormone production, etc. Moreover, trace elements are particularly involved in immune regulations. Here, we have summarized the roles of eight essential trace elements (iron, zinc, selenium, copper, iodine, chromium, molybdenum, cobalt) in T cell development, activation and differentiation, and immune response, which provides significant insights into developing novel approaches to modulate immunoregulation and immunotherapy.",11129730,0.1,0.05
"A female in her 60s with vague abdominal symptoms was found to have a pancreatic mass in her CT scan. A core needle biopsy done endoscopically demonstrated a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. The patient completed nine cycles of neoadjuvant systemic mFOLFIRINOX. Repeat staging demonstrated a partial radiographic response. She underwent an open pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy with segmental superior mesenteric vein resection with primary reconstruction (ISGPS Type 3). The final pathology demonstrated a poorly differentiated adenosquamous carcinoma, R1 margin status. The case report demonstrates the effect of mFOLFIRINOX on pancreatic adenosquamous (PASC) carcinoma with a review of the microscopic pictures following the neoadjuvant therapy. It can be postulated that glandular component being the major component in a PASC has a good response to mFOLFIRINOX like that seen in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma with some presumed effect on the squamous component as well. From the above case report, we are proposing that mFOLFIRINOX can be an effective chemotherapy regime in the management of PASC.",11129824,0.15,0.05
"Currently, tumor treatment modalities such as immunotherapy and targeted therapy have more stringent requirements for obtaining tumor growth information and require more accurate and easy‐to‐operate tumor information detection methods. Compared with traditional tissue biopsy, liquid biopsy is a novel, minimally invasive, real‐time detection tool for detecting information directly or indirectly released by tumors in human body fluids, which is more suitable for the requirements of new tumor treatment modalities. Liquid biopsy has not been widely used in clinical practice, and there are fewer reviews of related clinical applications. This review summarizes the clinical applications of liquid biopsy components (e.g., circulating tumor cells, circulating tumor DNA, extracellular vesicles, etc.) in tumorigenesis and progression. This includes the development process and detection techniques of liquid biopsies, early screening of tumors, tumor growth detection, and guiding therapeutic strategies (liquid biopsy‐based personalized medicine and prediction of treatment response). Finally, the current challenges and future directions for clinical applications of liquid biopsy are proposed. In sum, this review will inspire more researchers to use liquid biopsy technology to promote the realization of individualized therapy, improve the efficacy of tumor therapy, and provide better therapeutic options for tumor patients.",11130638,0.1,0.05
"The cestode Taenia hydatigena uses canids, primarily dogs, as definitive hosts, whereas the metacestode larval stage cysticercus infects a range of intermediate hosts, including domestic animals such as goats, sheep and pigs. In this study, we aimed to determine the genetic differences and haplotypes of Cysticercus tenuicollis isolates obtained from sheep and goats slaughtered in the Bingol and Elazig provinces of Turkey. C. tenuicollis isolates were collected from 44 sheep and 26 goats slaughtered in slaughterhouses in Bingol and Elazig. After the isolation of total genomic DNA from C. tenuicollis isolates, the genetic characterization of the partial mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase 1 (CO1) gene region (866 bp) was amplified using specific primers by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the products were then sequenced, and haplotype and genetic diversity analyses were carried out. As a result of the haplotype network analyses, 34 different haplotypes were detected around the main haplotype (Hap02) arranged in a star‐like configuration and separated from other haplotypes by 1–28 mutation steps and covering 22.85% (16/70) of all isolates. Twenty‐seven polymorphic fields were detected, 77.77% (21/27) of which were parsimony‐informative, and secondary haplotype and nucleotide diversity were observed. Additionally, we detected high intraspecies haplotype diversity (hd: 0.933) and high nucleotide diversity (π: 0.00383), with 27 different nucleotide variation positions among the haplotypes of the isolates. Tajima's D value was negative, indicating population expansion and/or selection purification. The significantly negative Fu's Fs values indicated recent population expansion or the presence of expected rare haplotypes. The results of this study confirmed that C. tenuicollis isolates clustered in one lineage and were closely related to the relevant reference sequences in different countries, confirming the circulation of C. tenuicollis in different geographical regions.",11131354,0.2,0.3
"Copper, a trace element and vital cofactor, plays a crucial role in the maintenance of biological functions. Recent evidence has established significant correlations between copper levels, cancer development and metastasis. The strong redox‐active properties of copper offer both benefits and disadvantages to cancer cells. The intestinal tract, which is primarily responsible for copper uptake and regulation, may suffer from an imbalance in copper homeostasis. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the most prevalent primary cancer of the intestinal tract and is an aggressive malignant disease with limited therapeutic options. Current research is primarily focused on the relationship between copper and CRC. Innovative concepts, such as cuproplasia and cuproptosis, are being explored to understand copper‐related cellular proliferation and death. Cuproplasia is the regulation of cell proliferation that is mediated by both enzymatic and nonenzymatic copper‐modulated activities. Whereas, cuproptosis refers to cell death induced by excess copper via promoting the abnormal oligomerisation of lipoylated proteins within the tricarboxylic acid cycle, as well as by diminishing the levels of iron‐sulphur cluster proteins. A comprehensive understanding of copper‐related cellular proliferation and death mechanisms offers new avenues for CRC treatment. In this review, we summarise the evolving molecular mechanisms, ranging from abnormal intracellular copper concentrations to the copper‐related proteins that are being discovered, and discuss the role of copper in the pathogenesis, progression and potential therapies for CRC. Understanding the relationship between copper and CRC will help provide a comprehensive theoretical foundation for innovative treatment strategies in CRC management.",11131360,0.15,0.05
"Esophageal cancer (ESCA) is a highly invasive malignant tumor with poor prognosis. This study aimed to discover a generalized and high‐sensitivity immune prognostic signature that could stratify ESCA patients and predict their overall survival, and to discover potential therapeutic drugs by the connectivity map. The key gene modules significantly related to clinical traits (survival time and state) of ESCA patients were selected by weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WCGNA), then the univariate and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression analyses were used to construct a 15‐immune‐related gene prognostic signature. The immune‐related risk model was related to clinical and pathologic factors and remained an effective independent prognostic factor. Enrichment analyses revealed that the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of the high‐ and low‐risk groups were associated with tumor cell proliferation and immune mechanisms. Based on the gathered data, a small molecule drug named perphenazine (PPZ) was elected. The pharmacological analysis indicates that PPZ could help in adjuvant therapy of ESCA through regulation of metabolic process and cellular proliferation, enhancement of immunologic functions, and inhibition of inflammatory reactions. Furthermore, molecular docking was performed to explore and verify the PPZ‐core target interactions. We succeed in structuring the immune‐related prognostic model, which could be used to distinguish and predict patients' survival outcome, and screening a small molecule drug named PPZ. Prospective studies also are needed to further validate its analytical accuracy for estimating prognoses and confirm the potential use of PPZ for treating ESCA.",11131936,0.15,0
"We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to better understand the association between rs1799762 PAI-1 gene polymorphism and the risk of RPL. A systematic search for studies that assessed the association between PAI-1 4G/5G polymorphism and RPL risk published in search sources, PubMed/Medline, ISI Web of Knowledge, Scopus, and Google Scholar till January 2024 was conducted. There were 23 case-control studies in total, with a high degree of statistical heterogeneity among them which indicated the need for subgroup analysis. We found a significant positive association between the risk of RPL and 4G/4G PAI-1 (OR: 2.57; 95% CI: 1.69-3.90), likewise 4G/5G (OR: 2/02 95% CI: 1.39-2.92) and mixed genotype (4G/4G+4G/5G) (OR: 2.31 95% CI: 1.81-2.93). Considering the ethnicity, the 4G/4G polymorphism is significantly associated with Asian descent (OR: 2.10; CI: 1.65-2.69) while the strong association (OR: 6.47; CI: 3.23-12.97) observed in the Greater Middle East descent is not statistically significant (P=0.16). PAI-1 4G/5G polymorphism association with RPL was only significant in Greater Middle East descent (OR: 2.93; CI: 2.41-3.56), and mixed genotype was significantly associated with RPL in Asian (OR: 2.37; CI: 1.55-3.61), Greater Middle East (OR: 3.01; CI: 2.16-4.19), and European populations (OR: 1.38; CI: 0.91-2.10). The association between RPL and PAI-1 4G/4G was significant for RPLs both under 12 weeks (OR: 1.82; 95% CI: 1.34-2.47), and under 24 weeks (OR: 1.46; 95% CI: 1.11-1.92), while considering heterozygote form the association was only significant for RPLs under 24 weeks (OR: 1.91; 95% CI: 1.58-2.31). Regarding the mixed genotype, there is a significant positive association between PAI-1 and RPL for RPLs under 12 weeks (OR: 2.09; 95% CI: 1.49-2.93), and under 24 weeks (OR: 2.10; 95% CI: 1.52-2.92).

"A 37-year-old male with type two diabetes presented to the hospital with new-onset heart failure and renal dysfunction. His left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction was less than 10%. Transthoracic echocardiography and cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging also revealed severe bicuspid aortic valve stenosis, dilated cardiomyopathy with LV hypertrophy, prominent LV trabeculations, and features suggestive of mild myocarditis with active inflammation. While myocarditis was suspected on CMR imaging, his mild degree of myocardial involvement did not explain the entirety of his clinical presentation, degree of LV dysfunction, or other structural abnormalities. An extensive work-up for his LV dysfunction was unremarkable for ischemic, metabolic, infiltrative, infectious, toxic, oncologic, connective tissue, and autoimmune etiologies. Genetic testing was positive for a myosin heavy chain 7 (MYH7) variant, which was deemed likely to be a unifying etiology underlying his presentation. The MYH7 sarcomere gene allows beta-myosin expression in heart ventricles, with variants associated with hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathies, congenital heart diseases, myocarditis, and excessive trabeculation (formerly known as left ventricular noncompaction). This case highlights the diverse array of cardiac pathologies that can present with MYH7 gene variants and reviews an extensive work-up for this unusual presentation of heart failure in a young patient.",11135834,0.55,0.4
"To report the case of a girl presenting a severe phenotype of mandibuloacral dysplasia type A (MADA) characterized by prominent osteolytic changes and ectodermal defects, associated with a rare homozygous LMNA missense mutation (c.1579C>T). A 6-year-old girl was evaluated during hospitalization exhibiting the following dysmorphic signs: subtotal alopecia, dysmorphic facies with prominent eyes, marked micrognathia and retrognathia, small beaked nose, teeth crowding and thin lips, generalized lipodystrophy, narrow and sloping shoulders, generalized joint stiffness and bone reabsorption in the terminal phalanges. In dermatological examination, atrophic skin, loss of cutaneous elasticity, hyperkeratosis, dermal calcinosis, and hyperpigmented and hypochromic patches were observed. Radiology exams performed showed bilateral absence of the mandibular condyles, clavicle resorption with local amorphous bone mass confluence with the scapulae, shoulder joints with subluxation and severe bone dysplasia, hip dysplasia, osteopenia and subcutaneous calcifications. MADA is a rare autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in LMNA gene. It is characterized by craniofacial deformities, skeletal anomalies, skin alterations, lipodystrophy in certain regions of the body and premature ageing. Typical MADA is caused by the p.R527H mutation in the LMNA gene. However, molecular analysis performed from oral epithelial cells obtained from the patient showed the rare mutation c.1579C>T, p.

"Current methods of processing archaeological samples combined with advances in sequencing methods lead to disclosure of a large part of H. neanderthalensis and Denisovans genetic information. It is hardly surprising that the genome variability between modern humans, Denisovans and H. neanderthalensis is relatively limited. Genomic studies may provide insight on the metabolism of extinct human species or lineages. Detailed analysis of G-quadruplex sequences in H. neanderthalensis and Denisovans mitochondrial DNA showed us interesting features. Relatively similar patterns in mitochondrial DNA are found compared to modern humans, with one notable exception for H. neanderthalensis. An interesting difference between H. neanderthalensis and H. sapiens corresponds to a motif found in the D-loop region of mtDNA, which is responsible for mitochondrial DNA replication. This area is directly responsible for the number of mitochondria and consequently for the efficient energy metabolism of cell. H. neanderthalensis harbor a long uninterrupted run of guanines in this region, which may cause problems for replication, in contrast with H. sapiens, for which this run is generally shorter and interrupted. One may propose that the predominant H. sapiens motif provided a selective advantage for modern humans regarding mtDNA replication and function.",11137754,0.1,0
"The causes of infertility have remained an important challenge. The relationship between VDR gene polymorphisms and infertility has been reported, with controversial findings. We aimed to determine this relationship by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis. The study was started with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) declaration and the final draft was registered as a protocol in PROSPERO (ID: CRD42023416535). The international electronic databases including PubMed (Medline), Scopus, Web of Sciences, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINHAL) were searched until January 30, 2023, by using appropriate keywords. The quality of the final studies was assessed using the NOS Checklist for case–control studies. The odds ratios (ORs) for each of the genetic models were pooled, and a subgroup analysis based on geographical region and types of infertility was carried out by the MetaGenyo online tool. Case–control studies including 18 and 2 studies about infertility in women and men, respectively, and 4 miscarriage studies were entered into the meta-analysis.

"Weight loss and lifestyle interventions are the mainstay of treatment in pediatric NAFLD. There are gaps in the literature on the objective improvement in BMI to meaningfully impact NAFLD in children.   To determine the decrease in BMI associated with a significant decline in ALT and other metabolic parameters.   Retrospective chart review of pediatric patients with the diagnosis of NAFLD. Data were collected at the baseline and 6 and 12 months. A linear regression model was used to assess the percent change in BMI predictive of change in ALT and other metabolic parameters.   281 charts were included. 71% of patients who had up to a 2.5% loss in BMI at 6 months had a decrease in ALT of up to 10 U/L compared to 43% patients who did not have a decrease in BMI up to 2.5% loss at the same time period (P=0.01). The linear regression model showed that 6-month and 12-month percent changes in BMI are predictive of 6-month and 12-month ALT changes (P=0.01 and 0.02), respectively. ALT normalization was achieved on 12% of patients with a ≥2.5% decrease in BMI at 6 months compared to 1% of patients that had no decrease of ≥2.5% decrease in BMI at 6 months (P=0.01). The mean BMI Z-score decline was 0.18 (P=0.001) in the group with a ≥2.5% decrease in BMI at 6 months.   BMI loss of up to 2.5% and the mean BMI Z-score 0.18 are associated with a significant decrease in ALT of up to 10 U/L. BMI percent change at 6 months and 12 months is predictive of changes in ALT.

"Ayurveda Rasayana Therapy (ART) may serve as a safe and effective alternative treatment option for chemo‐intolerance high‐grade stage IV follicular lymphoma patients for increasing survival and tumor regression. Follicular lymphoma (FL), also called follicle center lymphoma/nodular lymphoma, observed in the B lymphocytes (B‐cells). Available therapeutic options for follicular lymphoma are associated with various side effects and, patients with co‐morbidities can seldom tolerate the chemotherapy regimens. Rasayana therapy not only resulted in tumor regression and improved survival but also dealt with the adverse effects of previous chemotherapy drugs. Herein, we present a case of a 74‐year‐old female diagnosed with Follicular lymphoma who had undergone three cycles of chemotherapy with unresolved disease outcome and serious adverse events. The patient refused to undergo further cycles of chemotherapy. Her family decided to start Ayurveda treatment for her as an alternative therapy for cancer care. On thorough case taking considering the Ayurveda parameters personalized Rasayana therapy as planned for the patient with an aim for improvement in Quality of Life (QoL), increasing survival, and optimizing body's immune response to fight the tumor. After treatment of 8 months, this case demonstrated partial tumor response as evidenced by PET‐CT‐scan. Quality of Life as evaluated using FACT‐G was also seen improved besides significant improvement in physical performance status evaluated using ECOG. The patient showed a survival of 3.5 years after starting Ayurveda Rasayana Therapy (ART). Rasayana therapy was well tolerated by the patient. This case report indicates the potential role of ART as a therapeutic option in geriatric cancer patients who are not eligible for cytotoxic interventions. Case warrants further systematic investigation to evaluate the potential role of ART in the treatment of geriatric cancer patients.",11139640,0.15,0.05
"Simultaneous inhibition of angiotensin II AT1 and endothelin ETA receptors has emerged as a promising approach for treatment of chronic progressive kidney disease. This therapeutic approach has been advanced by the introduction of sparsentan, the first dual AT1 and ETA receptor antagonist. Sparsentan is a single molecule with high affinity for both receptors. It is US Food and Drug Administration approved for immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) and is currently being developed as a treatment for rare kidney diseases, such as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Clinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of sparsentan in these conditions. In parallel with clinical development, studies have been conducted to elucidate the mechanisms of action of sparsentan and its position in the context of published evidence characterizing the nephroprotective effects of dual ETA and AT1 receptor inhibition. This review summarizes this evidence, documenting beneficial anti-inflammatory, antifibrotic, and hemodynamic actions of sparsentan in the kidney and protective actions in glomerular endothelial cells, mesangial cells, the tubulointerstitium, and podocytes, thus providing the rationale for the use of sparsentan as therapy for focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and IgAN and suggesting potential benefits in other renal diseases, such as Alport syndrome.",11139641,0.15,0.05
"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading cancers worldwide, with metastasis being a major cause of high mortality rates among patients. In this study, dysregulated gene Tweety homolog 3 (TTYH3) was identified by Gene Expression Omnibus database. Public databases were used to predict potential competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) for TTYH3. Quantitative real‐time polymerase chain reaction, western blot, and immunohistochemistry were utilized to analyze TTYH3 and histone deacetylase 7 (HDAC7) levels. Luciferase assays confirmed miR‐1271‐5p directly targeting the 3′ untranslated regions of TTYH3 and HDAC7. In vitro experiments such as transwell and human umbilical vein endothelial cell tube formation, as well as in vivo mouse models, were conducted to assess the biological functions of TTYH3 and HDAC7. We discovered that upregulation of TTYH3 in CRC promotes cell migration by affecting the Epithelial–mesenchymal transition pathway, which was independent of its ion channel activity. Mechanistically, TTYH3 and HDAC7 functioned as ceRNAs, reciprocally regulating each other's expression. TTYH3 competes for binding miR‐1271‐5p, increasing HDAC7 expression, facilitating CRC metastasis and angiogenesis. This study reveals the critical role of TTYH3 in promoting CRC metastasis through ceRNA crosstalk, offering new insights into potential therapeutic targets for clinical intervention.",11141500,0.4,0
"Cervical cancer (CC) and other malignant malignancies are acknowledged to be primarily caused by persistent human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Historically, vaccinations against viruses that produce neutralizing antibodies unique to the virus have been an affordable way to manage viral diseases. CC risk is decreased, but not eliminated, by HPV vaccinations. Since vaccinations have been made available globally, almost 90% of HPV infections have been successfully avoided. On the lesions and diseases that are already present, however, no discernible treatment benefit has been shown. As a result, therapeutic vaccines that elicit immune responses mediated by cells are necessary for the treatment of established infections and cancers. mRNA vaccines possess remarkable potential in combating viral diseases and malignancy as a result of their superior industrial production, safety, and efficacy. Furthermore, considering the expeditiousness of production, the mRNA vaccine exhibits promise as a therapeutic approach targeting HPV. Given that the HPV-encoded early proteins, including oncoproteins E6 and E7, are consistently present in HPV-related cancers and pre-cancerous lesions and have crucial functions in the progression and persistence of HPV-related diseases, they serve as ideal targets for therapeutic HPV vaccines. The action mechanism of HPV and HPV-related cancer mRNA vaccines, their recent advancements in clinical trials, and the potential for their therapeutic applications are highlighted in this study, which also offers a quick summary of the present state of mRNA vaccines. Lastly, we highlight a few difficulties with mRNA HPV vaccination clinical practice and provide our thoughts on further advancements in this quickly changing sector. It is expected that mRNA vaccines will soon be produced quickly for clinical HPV prevention and treatment.

"Histone deacetylase (HDAC) serves as a critical molecular regulator in the pathobiology of various malignancies and have garnered attention as a viable target for therapeutic intervention. A variety of HDAC inhibitors (HDACis) have been developed to target HDACs. Many preclinical studies have conclusively demonstrated the antitumor effects of HDACis, whether used as monotherapy or in combination treatments. On this basis, researchers have conducted various clinical studies to evaluate the potential of selective and pan-HDACis in clinical settings. In our work, we extensively summarized and organized current clinical trials, providing a comprehensive overview of the current clinical advancements in targeting HDAC therapy. Furthermore, we engaged in discussions about several clinical trials that did not yield positive outcomes, analyzing the factors that led to their lack of anticipated therapeutic effectiveness. Apart from the experimental design factors, issues such as toxicological side effects, tumor heterogeneity, and unexpected off-target effects also contributed to these less-than-expected results. These challenges have naturally become significant barriers to the application of HDACis. Despite these challenges, we believe that advancements in HDACi research and improvements in combination therapies will pave the way or lead to a broad and hopeful future in the treatment of solid tumors.",11143662,0.1,0.05
"As one of the most prevalent chronic inflammatory skin diseases, atopic dermatitis (AD) increasingly affects the aging population. Amid the ongoing global aging trend, it’s essential to recognize the intricate relationship between AD and aging. This paper reviews existing knowledge, summarizing clinical observations of associations between AD and aging-related diseases in various systems, including endocrine, cardiovascular, and neurological. Additionally, it discusses major theories explaining the correlation, encompassing skin-mucosal barriers, systemic inflammation and stress, genes, signal transduction, and environmental and behavioral factors. The association between AD and aging holds significant importance, both in population and basic perspectives. While further research is warranted, this paper aims to inspire deeper exploration of inflammation/allergy-aging dynamics and the timely management of elderly patients with AD.",11144009,0.15,0.05
"Human hemoglobin of G-Makassar and hemoglobin E (Hb E) are hemoglobin variants that affect Beta (β) globin. Hb G-Makassar is a very rare variant while Hb E is estimated to affect at least one million people worldwide. Both Hb G-Makassar and Hb E can be inherited in the heterozygous, homozygous or compound heterozygous state. This case series describes the characteristics of four individuals with compound heterozygosity for Hb G-Makassar/Hb E cases in Malaysia. To the best of our knowledge, these are the only four individuals with this genotype reported in the literature. We present four cases of compound heterozygosity for Hb G-Makassar/Hb E identified from October 2014 to January 2021. All the cases were incidental findings whereby the screening Hb analysis showed the presence of peaks in both Hb S and Hb E zones on capillary electrophoresis (CE) and cation-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Molecular analysis confirmed the findings of compound heterozygous Hb G-Makassar/Hb E. Two cases had a history of anemia secondary to unrelated conditions that resolved with treatment of the underlying cause. The other two cases were asymptomatic individuals who were detected through Malaysia’s National Thalassemia Screening program. On the last follow-up, all the individuals were well, non-transfusion dependent, and had no reported history of chronic anemia, bleeding, hemolysis or thromboembolism complications. The cases reported here highlight the possibilities for rare compound heterozygous states in multi-ethnicity populations such as Malaysia. Compound heterozygous Hb G-Makassar/Hb E individuals are clinically silent with laboratory values suggesting microcytic and hypochromic red blood cells. Further local epidemiology or population studies with genotyping tests are required for a better understanding of the diversity of its clinical phenotype.",11144427,0.5,0.1
"For many diseases, and cancer in particular, early diagnosis allows a wider range of therapies and a better disease management. This has led to improvements in diagnostic procedures, most often based on tissue biopsies or blood samples. Other biological fluids have been used to diagnose disease, and among them saliva offers a number of advantages because it can be collected non-invasively from large populations at relatively low cost. To what extent might saliva content reveal the presence of a tumour located at a distance from the oral cavity and the molecular information obtained from saliva be used to establish a diagnosis are current questions. This review focuses primarily on the content of saliva and shows how it potentially offers a source of diagnosis, possibly at an early stage, for pathologies such as cancers or endometriosis.",11144459,0.1,0.05
"Solute carrier family 26 (Slc26) is a family of anion exchangers with 11 members in mammals (named Slc26a1‐a11). Here, we identified a novel member of the slc26 family, slc26a12, located in tandem with slc26a2 in the genomes of several vertebrate lineages. BLAST and synteny analyses of various jawed vertebrate genome databases revealed that slc26a12 is present in coelacanths, amphibians, reptiles, and birds but not in cartilaginous fishes, lungfish, mammals, or ray‐finned fishes. In some avian and reptilian lineages such as owls, penguins, egrets, and ducks, and most turtles examined, slc26a12 was lost or pseudogenized. Phylogenetic analysis showed that Slc26a12 formed an independent branch with the other Slc26 members and Slc26a12, Slc26a1 and Slc26a2 formed a single branch, suggesting that these three members formed a subfamily in Slc26. In jawless fish, hagfish have two genes homologous to slc26a2 and slc26a12, whereas lamprey has a single gene homologous to slc26a2. African clawed frogs express slc26a12 in larval gills, skin, and fins. These results show that slc26a12 was present at least before the separation of lobe‐finned fish and tetrapods; the name slc26a12 is appropriate because the gene duplication occurred in the distant past.",11145369,0,0
