        <p>LOE-Prognostic-Level III</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Current understanding of the outcomes of traumatic hip dislocation (THD) in pediatric patients is still limited. This study aims to assess the radiological, clinical, and functional results of patients with THD, whether in isolation or in conjunction with acetabular (ACF) or proximal femur (PFF) fracture, and to identify potential risk factors for unfavorable outcomes.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> This is a retrospective study of pediatric patients with THD consecutively enrolled at three different institutions between January 2016 and July 2023. Patients were categorized into three groups: isolated THD (Group A), THD with ACF (Group B), and THD with PFF (Group C). Standard radiographs were utilized to classify each THD and identify the presence of any other associated bone lesions. Clinical and functional outcomes were assessed via the Harris Hip score (HHS). Avascular necrosis (AVN) was determined according to the Ratliff criteria. The association between outcome and associated injuries, age at trauma (&#x2264;10 versus &gt;&#x2009;11&#x2009;years), traumatic mechanism (low energy versus high energy), reduction type (open versus closed), and dislocation&#x2019;s direction (posterior versus anterior) was evaluated.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Sixty-six cases of unilateral THD (63 posterior) were analyzed, consisting of 42 males and 24 females, with an average age of 10.5&#x2009;years (3&#x2013;18&#x2009;years). Out of these, 25 patients were aged &#x2264;10&#x2009;years (37.88%), of which 18 had low-energy trauma. Meanwhile, 41 patients were &gt;11&#x2009;years old (62.12%), of which 25 had high-energy trauma (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001). It was observed that Group A patients were significantly younger than those in groups B and C (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001). Group A had 5/31 patients with labral injury (16.1%), Group B had 2/22 patients with AC fractures misdiagnosed &gt;3&#x2009;weeks after injury (18%), and Group C had 3/13 patients with AVN (23%). Most patients exhibited a favorable mean HHS (92.17; SD: &#xB1;7.16), except for individuals with AVN and those with misdiagnosed AC fractures (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The outcome of THD is worse in patients with AVN secondary to PF fracture, misdiagnosed AC fractures, high-energy trauma, and older age at the time of injury. A computed tomography (CT) scan is necessary to rule out AC fractures in isolated dislocations. If pain persists after reduction, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is needed to uncover labral injury. Timely diagnosis and treatment of these lesions typically lead to a favorable outcome.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> In more than 50% of THD cases, there are associated injuries that must be eliminated being significant risk factors for negative outcomes.</p>

Compliance with this recommendation has been reported to be poor and identification of risk factors associated with positive NAT diagnosis, elusive. The purpose of this study was to analyze a multicenter national database to calculate the frequency of NAT screening, NAT diagnosis, and risk factors associated with a positive NAT diagnosis in children (&lt;36&#x2009;months) presenting with a DFF.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A total of 1263 children (&lt;36&#x2009;months) with DFF presenting to one of 15 CORTICES hospitals were identified. Positive NAT was recorded when a child was removed from their caregivers by CPS. Percent compliance of NAT screening and proportion of patients who received a positive NAT diagnosis were calculated with 95% confidence interval (CI). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to determine factors associated with positive NAT.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> The median age was 23&#x2009;months (0.2&#x2013;36&#x2009;months). Seventy-one percent were male. Fifty-six percent (704/1263) underwent NAT evaluation (95% CI, 52.9&#x2013;58.5). Fifteen percent of all patients had a positive NAT diagnosis (185/1263; 95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;12.8&#x2013;16.7). Of the 704 patients who underwent NAT evaluation, 26% had a positive NAT diagnosis (95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;23.1&#x2013;29.7). Multivariable logistic regression analysis found children &lt;15.4&#x2009;months to be 5.5 times (odds ratio (OR)&#x2009;=&#x2009;5.52; 95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;4.14&#x2013;7.37; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) more likely of being diagnosed with NAT compared to older children. Patients who identified as non-White had two times the odds of a positive NAT diagnosis compared to patients identifying as White (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.04; 95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.53&#x2013;2.71; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01). For each 10-unit increase in Area Deprivation Index (ADI), the odds of a positive NAT diagnosis increased by 18% (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.18; 95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.17&#x2013;1.19; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.007). Patients with conflicting mechanism of injury had 3.5 times the odds (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;3.49; 95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.45&#x2013;4.98; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) of a positive NAT diagnosis.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Only 56% of patients were evaluated for NAT; however, 26% of those evaluated were positive for NAT. Younger age, race, socioeconomic factors (defined here by ADI), and unknown mechanism of injury are risk factors to consider when assessing for NAT in children (&lt;36&#x2009;months) with DFF.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This is the largest report on the risk of NAT associated with children &lt;36&#x2009;months presenting with DFF. It is the first use multicenter/multi-region data to confirm previously reported risk factors. It is also the first report to link socioeconomic factors (ADI) to NAT in this population. Improved national compliance with NAT screening is necessary to improve the care we provide to our children.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Pediatric patients with an intellectual disability disorder (IDD) are known to be at a higher risk of experiencing child abuse. In this study, we aim to determine the odds of a pediatric patient experiencing a non-accidental traumatic fracture (NATF) and stratify this by degree of intellectual disability when compared to accidental traumatic fractures (ATFs).</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A large, nationally representative sample of 15,802,711 children was identified, with 16,441 of those patients sustaining NATF and 15,786,270 sustaining an ATF between 1 January 2003 and 31 December 2022. Of these patients, 260 of the NATF patients had some degree of IDD, and 3450 of the ATF patients had some degree of IDD. Patients were then stratified by degree of IDD. Retrospective cohort analysis was performed to determine odds ratios of patients in each category to sustain an NATF compared to an ATF.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> When comparing patients with profound intellectual disability to those without intellectual disability, patients had a 184.28 times greater odds of sustaining an NATF (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001), patients with severe intellectual disability had a 145.523 times greater odds of sustaining an NATF (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001), patients with moderate intellectual disability had a 36.34 times greater odds of sustaining an NATF (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001), and patients with a mild intellectual disability had a 35.32 times greater odds of sustaining an NATF (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001) (Figure 1).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Patients with increasingly severe intellectual disability had increasing odds to sustain an NATF relative to patients without intellectual disability. It is critical that physicians are aware of this relationship to identify patients who may be at increased risk of experiencing abuse.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> The stark escalation in odds of NATF with increasing severity of intellectual disability underscores a dire need for enhanced physician awareness, improved preventive measures, and stringent child protection protocols.</p>

        <p>LOE-Therapeutic-Level III</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Ischial tuberosity avulsion fractures are relatively rare injuries that typically occur in young athletes during activity. Some patients may experience significant morbidity, often through chronic pain and changes in sports participation. The influence of fragment displacement on optimal treatment and proper return to sport protocol has not been well investigated. This study sought to evaluate the relationship between displacement and both choice of treatment and time to return to sport.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Retrospective analysis of ischial tuberosity avulsion fractures in pediatric patients between 2010 and 2021 at Boston Children&#x2019;s Hospital was completed. Information regarding demographics, treatment, and recovery were extracted from patient charts. Plain radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were analyzed to measure fragment displacement at the ischial apophysis. Treatment protocol, return to sport (RTS) time, and complications were analyzed.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Eighty-eight patients with an ischial tuberosity avulsion fracture were identified. Sixty-four (73%) were treated non-operatively, 8 (9%) were treated acute operatively (within 6&#x2009;weeks), and 16 (18%) were treated chronic operatively (&gt;6&#x2009;weeks). Imaging for measurement of fragment displacement was available for 86 (98%) patients. The median displacement was 0.2&#x2009;cm for the non-operative group, 2.2&#x2009;cm for the acute operative group, and 1.5&#x2009;cm for the chronic operative group. Of the 86 patients with available imaging, 67 (78%) had an RTS time. The median RTS was 3.6&#x2009;months in the non-operative group, 5.5&#x2009;months in the acute operative group, and 13.3&#x2009;months in the chronic operative group.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In this retrospective cohort study, nearly all fractures with displacement &#x2265;1.0&#x2009;cm were surgically treated, either acutely or at a delayed time point because of failure of non-operative treatment. All patients who underwent acute operation had displacement &gt;1.0&#x2009;cm, while 87% of those undergoing delayed operation had displacements &gt;1.0&#x2009;cm. The vast majority of those treated non-operatively had displacement &lt;1&#x2009;cm, with only three patients in the series having successful return to sport despite displacement &gt;1&#x2009;cm. Overall, non-operatively treated patients returned to sport approximately 1&#x2009;month earlier than those undergoing acute operation and several months prior to those with delayed surgical intervention. These data suggest that patients with displacement &lt;1.0&#x2009;cm may be successfully treated non-operatively while greater displacement most commonly underwent surgical to ultimately optimize outcome and return to sport.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This study suggests that there may be an approximate threshold measure of displacement at which ischial tuberosity avulsion fractures may be considered for operative treatment to result in the most successful outcomes.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Apophyseal pelvic avulsion fractures occur almost exclusively in the adolescent athlete population. A possible relationship between femoro-acetabular impingement (FAI) and pelvic avulsion fractures has been discussed in the literature, but no prior studies have investigated the hip morphology of patients with pelvic avulsion fractures. The purpose of this study is to use computed tomography (CT) imaging to compare morphologic femoral and acetabular measurements of adolescents who sustained a pelvic avulsion fracture to those of gender- and age-matched controls. We hypothesize that a higher incidence of radiographic FAI will be found in patients with pelvic avulsion fractures than in the matched control patients.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Cases of pelvic avulsion fractures were retrospectively reviewed from the electronic medical records at a tertiary care pediatric center. Patients with CT imaging of the hip near the time of injury were included for analysis. The avulsion fracture cohort was matched in a 1:2 ratio to non-fractured hips with CT imaging based on age and sex. Cranial acetabular version, central acetabular version, lateral center edge angle, and alpha angles&#x2014;anterior, anterior-superior, superior, posterior-superior, posterior&#x2014;were measured for all subjects. Radiographic measurements were compared between the avulsion cohort and matched controls using independent sample Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. A logistic regression model estimated the effect of the presence of avulsion fracture on the likelihood of CAM impingement (any alpha angle &gt;55&#xB0;).</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Thirty-four hips with avulsion fractures were matched to 68 hips without avulsion fractures for analysis. Avulsion fracture subjects had 2.5 times the odds of impingement, compared to controls (odds ratio (OR)&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.5; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.04). The anterior-superior alpha angle was 5&#xB0; higher for the avulsion cohort compared to controls (median, 58&#xB0; versus 53&#xB0;; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.03). Additional findings include a 2&#xB0; lower superior alpha angle (median, 40&#xB0; versus 42&#xB0;; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.03) and 3&#xB0; higher central acetabular version (median, 17&#xB0; versus 14&#xB0;; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.03) for the avulsion group compared to controls.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our findings demonstrate that patients with an apophyseal pelvic avulsion fracture are significantly more likely to show radiographic evidence of FAI when compared to matched controls. These data may represent a morphologic predisposition to avulsion fractures among adolescents with pre-existing FAI.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This is the first study to identify pre-existing morphologic features of the hip that are associated with adolescent pelvic avulsion fractures. In addition, this adds to the list of injuries that have been shown in the literature to be associated with FAI.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Behind motor vehicle accidents, gunshot injuries are the leading cause of injury-related death in the pediatric population in the United States. The goal of this study was to analyze trends among children with firearm injuries to better understand if certain age groups, mechanisms of injury, and type of firearms were driving the increasing rates of pediatric gun-related trauma.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> This study includes pediatric gunshot wound patients who presented to a single free-standing level 1 pediatric hospital or died at the scene from 2010 to 2021. All the hospital data were collected prospectively as part of a level 1 trauma system database. All the death data were collected from the local coroner&#x2019;s office. Patients were grouped according to age (0&#x2013;1&#x2009;years, 1&#x2013;4&#x2009;years, 5&#x2013;9&#x2009;years, 10&#x2013;14&#x2009;years, 15+&#x2009;years), mechanism of injury (suicide, assault, accident, unknown), and weapon type (handgun, air gun, BB gun, shotgun, hunting rifle, unknown, other).</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> From 2010 to 2021, there were 1126 pediatric gunshot injuries in the geographic region studied. The incidence of firearm trauma in pediatric patients has increased rapidly over the time studied. Rise in injury rates occurred most strikingly in the older adolescent age groups 3 and 4 (Figure 1a), in the category of assault (Figure 1b), and among handguns (Figure 1c). Younger age groups, suicides, accidents, and injury by hunting rifle remained relatively stable over time.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Firearm injuries are the second leading cause of injury-related death in the pediatric population in the United States, and they are increasing in frequency year-to-year at an alarming rate. These findings demonstrate that overall rates of firearm injuries in the pediatric and adolescent populations have increased over the period of interest with most of the increase occurring in older children from assault with handguns. These data can hopefully help inform civic leaders, law enforcement officials, and legislators to design strategies to combat these areas of concern.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Analysis of specific groups, types of firearms, and mechanism of injuries will hopefully allow for risk stratification and future interventions. The findings of this study will hopefully provide insight on how best to initiate change and where to focus prevention strategies.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> The purpose of this study was to report risk factors for loss of reduction of pediatric distal radius fractures from a large prospective multicenter cohort. We hypothesized that fractures with increased translation and angulation at the time of injury would be more likely to lose reduction.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Children aged 4&#x2013;18&#x2009;years old undergoing closed reduction for a displaced distal radius fracture and enrolled in the Pediatric Distal Radius Fracture (PDRF) Registry at four academic children&#x2019;s hospitals were included. Children with open fractures, torus fractures, incomplete radiographs, or less than 4&#x2009;weeks of follow-up were excluded. Radiographic loss of reduction (LOR) was defined as a change in angulation &#x2265;10&#x2009;degrees or an increase in translation greater than 50% of the radial width in any plane. Demographic, clinical, and radiographic variables were analyzed; bivariate analysis and multivariate logistic regressions were performed.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> In total, 616 children (69% male) were eligible with a mean age of 10.4&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;3.4&#x2009;years. Most subjects sustained bicortical distal radius fractures (68%), followed by Salter-Harris II physeal fractures (26%). The rate of radiographic LOR was 44% (271/616). LOR was more likely in patients &lt;11&#x2009;years old (54% versus 34%), in metaphyseal bicortical fractures compared to physeal fractures (53% versus 24%), when initial fracture translation exceeded 100%, and in patients with concomitant ulnar fracture (48% versus 27%) (all p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001; Table 1). On multivariate analysis, metaphyseal bicortical radial fractures (odds ratio (OR)&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.57), &#x2265;51% translation on injury films (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;3.68), and non-anatomic closed reductions (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;3.00) significantly increased the odds of LOR. Ultimately, 47/616 children (8%) underwent secondary procedures, including repeat closed reduction or operative treatment. Children with self-identified White race (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), increased pre-reduction translation (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002), and pre-reduction angulation (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.013) were more likely to undergo a secondary procedure (Table 1). On multivariate analysis, non-anatomic closed reductions increased odds of secondary procedures (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;3.13), while self-identified Black race decreased these odds (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.16).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Bicortical metaphyseal fractures, &#x2265;51% radial translation on pre-reduction films, and concomitant metaphyseal ulna fracture independently increase the odds of LOR for pediatric distal radius fractures. Patient body mass index (BMI) does not appear to influence LOR. Future investigations are warranted to study the relationships between LOR, secondary procedures, and patient race.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Orthopedic providers are advised that radiographic loss of reduction of &#x2265;10&#x2009;degrees is not uncommon for pediatric distal radius fractures. Bicortical fractures with &#x2265;51% shaft width translation and concomitant ulna fracture should be closely monitored in clinic for LOR.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Elastic stable intramedullary nailing (ESIN) is the treatment of choice for diaphyseal forearm fractures in children. However, when the fracture is located at the distal metaphyso-diaphyseal junction (DMDJ), the radial nail has only limited support on the distal fragment. This study aims to evaluate a modified ESIN method to treat these fractures.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> The technique is initially carried out identically to a classic ESIN. Once its ascent is complete, the radial nail is moved back 4&#x2009;cm and angled at 90&#xB0; in its extra-osseous portion. The nail is then pushed back so that the entire angulated part penetrates the distal radius, increasing the pressure on the distal medial cortex. This has the effect of stabilizing the fracture in a perfectly aligned position. Between 2010 and 2015, 27 patients were included. Surgical treatment was accepted for fractures with an angulation greater than 20&#xB0; and instability after reduction.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Modified ESIN achieved a good and stable reduction of the fracture, with no displacement until late follow-up at 6&#x2009;months.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This study confirms the feasibility and effectiveness of the modified ESIN technique as a treatment for these fractures.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Modified ESIN offers a new and reliable approach for DMDJ.</p>

        <p>LOE-Therapeutic-Level IV</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Hardware removal (HR) is one of the most common surgical procedures in pediatric orthopedics. Surgeons advocate for HR for a variety of reasons, including to limit peri-implant fracture risk, native anatomy for adult reconstruction surgery, and to mitigate implant-related pain/irritation. To our knowledge, no recent study has investigated the characteristics and complications of HR in pediatric orthopedics. The goal of this study is to report the prevalence and complications of HRs across all pediatric fractures.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective case series was conducted of all HRs from 2014 to 2022 for patients who suffered a fracture requiring surgical intervention at a single urban tertiary care children&#x2019;s hospital. Cases were identified using CPT codes/billing records. Spinal hardware and elective deformity correction hardware were excluded. Patient demographic and clinical data were recorded. For patients with multiple HRs, each case was recorded independently.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Five hundred and fourteen HR cases for 478 patients met the study criteria. The median post-operative follow-up time was 1.58&#x2009;weeks (interquartile range (IQR): 0.56&#x2013;5.35). In total, 346 (67.3%) of the cohort were male. The mean age at HR was 12.05 (SD: 3.91), and the median BMI was 18.33 (IQR: 15.4&#x2013;21.8). Pain (36.5%), surgeon preference/planned removal (36.1%), and parent/patient preference (14.6%) were the most common indications for HR. 85.4% of patients who underwent HR for pain experienced pain relief post-operatively. 50.4% cases were upper extremity while 49.6% were lower extremity. Flexible intramedullary nails (39.8%), single screws (39.5%), and compression plates with screws (15.2%) were the most common types of hardware removed. Fifty-seven (11.0%) of HRs had a complication. Seven (1.4%) cases had a surgical site infection. Seven (1.4%) cases had new, persistent pain after HR. Six (1.2%) cases had re-fracture (five forearm/wrist, one femur/knee). Of the forearm/wrist re-fracture cases, two occurred at prior fracture site, and three occurred adjacent to flexible intramedullary nail location. Six (1.2%) cases had incomplete HR (two syndesmosis screws, one distal tibia screw, one T-condylar screw, one supracondylar screw, one ulna flexible intramedullary nail). Four (0.8%) patients had hardware breakage while four (0.8%) had nerve palsy/injury (one each for radial, median, ulnar, and plantar nerves). Two (0.4%) patients suffered from a seroma/hematoma and one (0.2%) required re-operation.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> HR following fracture fixation in pediatric orthopedics is associated with an overall complication rate of 11.0%.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Removal of hardware following semi-elective pediatric fracture surgery is not benign, and the 11% complication rate should be a part of the informed consent process.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Pediatric diaphyseal forearm fractures (PDFF) are very common injuries. Fractures needing surgery are most often treated with metal elastic stable intramedullary nails (ESIN). Metal nail removal is widely advocated; however, it is a burden on the child, the family, and healthcare economy. Bioabsorbable intramedullary nails (BIN) made from poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) have been developed for some of the same indications as metal ESIN. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and safety of BIN (Activa IM-Nail&#x2122;, Bioretec, Tampere, Finland) for PDFF.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> From 1 May 2021 to 30 September 2022, children with unstable PDFF requiring surgery were sought to be prospectively and consecutively recruited. Surgical indications were complete fracture and displacement &gt;50% of bone width or angulation &gt;10&#xB0; in any plane or irreducible or unstable after closed reduction. If consented, patients were operated with the Activa IM-Nail&#x2122; followed by 4&#x2009;weeks of cast. Primary outcome was radiographic healing at 3&#x2009;months assessed by the Radiographic Union Score (RUS). Secondary outcomes were pain, wound appearance, neurovascular status, bilateral elbow, forearm range of motion (ROM), fracture angulation and displacement, and any adverse device effects (ADE).</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> In total, 27 children were eligible for inclusion and 9 children were excluded (2 declined participation, 6 fractures were reduced and casted, 1 had metal ESIN due to narrow intramedullary canal). Eighteen children were operated with BIN, 8 girls and 10 boys, mean age 10&#x2009;years (4&#x2013;14&#x2009;years). Operating time was a mean of 66 (24&#x2013;115) minutes. RUS was at least 8 at 3&#x2009;months after surgery, 10 at 6&#x2009;months, and 12 at 1&#x2009;year. Three months after surgery, all patients had pain free and normal ROM. There were no serious adverse device effects (SADEs). Two children developed minor postoperative fracture angulation that did not require manipulation. One child sustained a non-displaced radius fracture 5&#x2009;months after surgery and was treated in a cast. Another child sustained a displaced radius fracture more than 12&#x2009;months after surgery and was treated with metal ESIN. One child with an open fracture had a pain free non-union and is awaiting further treatment.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The use of BIN showed results similar to metal ESIN. Three months after surgery, all, but one child, had solid healing and all children had pain free and normal ROM.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> The use of BIN for PDFF is feasible, seems very safe, and eliminates the need for further surgery to remove implants.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> What is needed to adequately treat pediatric fractures? A healthy and degradable implant material without harmful elements to overcome implant-related issues such as hypersensitivities or accumulation of metals in tissues. Another major advantage of degradable materials is the obviation of hardware removal after fracture healing. Hence, implantation through the active physis without affecting longitudinal bone growth, by using resorbable magnesium (Mg)-based implants, could broaden the spectrum of pediatric fracture treatment. Hence, the aim of the study was to investigate the local and systemic response of trans-epiphyseally implanted Mg-based ZX00 screws (Mg synthesized with &lt;0.5&#x2009;wt% Zn &lt;0.5% Ca; l&#x2009;=&#x2009;40&#x2009;mm; d&#x2009;=&#x2009;3.5&#x2009;mm) on the active physis in a sheep model.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Three-month-old female, juvenile sheep (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;8) underwent monocortical implantation with ZX00 through the epiphysis of the right tibia, whereas the left tibia was either implanted with a titanium (Ti) screw or was left untreated to serve as a control. In order to monitor ZX00 degradation and physis defects, in vivo clinical computed tomography (cCT) was performed at 3, 6, 12, 24, 52, 104, and 156&#x2009;weeks post-surgery. All animals were sacrificed 180&#x2009;weeks post-surgery. Tibiae and soft tissues were excised for further analysis. To quantitatively calculate the limb length difference (LLD) and physeal defect area, ex vivo high-resolution micro-computed tomography (&#xB5;CT; 20&#x2009;&#xB5;m per voxel) was performed. Undecalcified tibiae with implants were embedded in Technovit for hard qualitative histology. To examine biocompatibility, organs were collected for soft tissue histology.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> First, we observed ZX00 screw breakage between 12 and 24&#x2009;weeks post-surgery, resulting in ZX00 movement away from the physis, which additionally showed remarkable healing capacity, resulting in the absence of defect and axial deviation at 2&#x2009;years. However, at 104 and 156&#x2009;weeks post-surgery, Ti legs were significantly shorter (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05) when compared to ZX00 and Ctrl legs. In regard to biocompatibility, bone tissue did not show any signs of foreign body reactions or encapsulation. Moreover, qualitative assessment of histologically stained soft tissues did not reveal any harmful effect due to implantation and degradation.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These findings indicate the advantages of Mg-based implants for pediatric internal fracture fixation.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> ZX00 implants are promising due to their biocompatibility and biodegradability, thereby minimizing complications, such as growth discrepancies, foreign body reactions, or encapsulations, making them superior for pediatric interventions.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Severely displaced and shortened distal pediatric forearm fractures may require closed reduction. Many authors recommend osteosynthesis if the fracture remains unstable. The gold standard method is percutaneous pinning with Kirschner wires. K-wire-related complications like migration of the pins, superficial infections, and skin irritation are relatively frequent. We present the results of a prospective multicenter study comparing the K-wire technique and a new bioresorbable intramedullary nailing procedure.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> We compared the results of K-wire osteosynthesis (KW groups) and biodegradable nailing (BR groups) of three Level I pediatric trauma centers. We compared the incidence of minor and major complications (superficial skin infection, tendon injury, nerve injury, secondary displacement, deep infection, skin irritation), differences in operative and radiation time, and unplanned medical check-up visits. Inclusion criteria were the clinical diagnosis of an unstable distal radial/forearm metaphyseal fracture with complete displacement, the presence of open growth plates, the child&#x2019;s age under 14&#x2009;years, and a minimal follow-up of 1&#x2009;year.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 160 patients met the criteria indicated above (82 in the BR group, 78 in the KW group). No significant differences in age or right- or left-hand involvement were observed in either group. There was no significant difference between operative time. Radiation time was slightly reduced in the BR group. The number of minor complications was significantly reduced in the BR group. Secondary intervention (implant removal) was not necessary at all in the BR group, while in the KW group the K-wire had to be removed from all children. The number of unplanned medical examinations in the first 6&#x2009;weeks was significantly lower in the BR group. After the 1-year follow-up, there was no difference in function between the two groups. Growth disturbance was not observed in either group after 1&#x2009;year.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The biodegradable nailing technique eliminates the need for new implant removal interventions and reduces minor complications and the number of repeated, unplanned medical control examinations.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> The paper is about a new alternative to a very common intervention. In addition to the health benefits, the absence of further intervention can also increase cost-effectiveness.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Bracing is the standardized care in treating progressive adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). Scoliosis-specific exercises (SSE), as an add-on to bracing treatment, show the promising effects in preventing curve progression. However, the general SSE is performed while patients take off the brace, which sacrifices the bracing hour that is a vital influencing factor of bracing success. Objective is to compare the difference between the SSE with wearing brace (SSE with brace-on), SSE without wearing brace (SSE with brace-off), and brace alone in preventing curve progression of AIS.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> This was an assessor- and patient-blinded, randomized control trial with 4-year follow-up. One hundred and twenty patients undertaking Cheneau bracing treatment participated and randomly allocated into three groups: SSE with brace-on (group 1), SSE with brace-off (group 2), and brace-alone (group 3). SSE protocol was standardized with seven exercises with and without wearing the brace, 1.5&#x2009;h/day for 5&#x2009;days a week for patients in groups 1 and 2. Initial curve magnitude (Cobb angle at baseline before bracing treatment), in-brace correction, and the follow-up outcomes (Cobb angle without brace at every 6&#x2009;months till skeletal maturity) were assessed by two surgeons blinded to this study. Exercise compliance and bracing compliance were monitored by tele questionnaire bi-weekly. Scoliosis Research Society 22-item questionnaire (SRS-22) was studied in addition to the changes of Cobb angle. Intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) analyses were performed with mixed model analysis of variance (ANOVA).</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Patients showed no differences of initial curve magnitude, curve pattern, in-brace correction, and demographic characteristics between groups at baseline. Eighteen patients dropped out of this study; thus, outcomes of 102 patients were analyzed. The average bracing hour was highest in group 3 (group 1: 18&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;2.2&#x2009;h/d; group 2: 17&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;3.8&#x2009;h/d; group 3: 19&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;0.6&#x2009;h/d, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02). ITT analysis showed that the Cobb angle of the major curve, after brace weaned, was comparable between group 1 and group 2 (29&#xB0;&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;5.4&#xB0; versus 30&#xB0;&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;3.6&#xB0;, p&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.05), yet was higher in group 3 (36&#xB0;&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;7.8&#xB0;, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01). PP analysis revealed that the highest reduction of Cobb angle was observed in group 2 (group 1: 27&#xB0;&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;4.2&#xB0;; group 2: 25&#xB0;&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;5.3&#xB0;; group 3: 33&#xB0;&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;7.2&#xB0;, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01), but the differences between group 1 and group 2 were within measurement error.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Bracing with SSE was better than bracing alone in treating progressive AIS. SSE performed with wearing brace was comparable to SSE performed without wearing brace in preventing curve progression.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Bracing with SSE shows promising effects in treating progressive AIS.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Surgery for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) typically involves posterior spinal fusion (PSF) using rods contoured by the surgeon, which may be time-consuming and may not reliably restore optimal coronal and sagittal alignment. With the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and preoperative planning software to develop pre-contoured patient-specific rods, restoration of more optimal spinal alignment may be achieved. However, the literature lacks studies with a comparative group investigating outcomes of pre-contoured rods in AIS surgery.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> This is a retrospective review of prospectively collected data of two consecutive groups of AIS patients who underwent PSF with surgeon contoured or patient-specific rods. Demographics, Lenke classification, fused levels, osteotomies, estimated blood loss (EBL), surgical time, and last follow-up Scoliosis Research Society (SRS)-22 scores were obtained via chart review. Radiographic measurements including coronal Cobb angle, T5-T12 thoracic kyphosis (TK), lumbar lordosis (LL), pelvic incidence (PI), PI-LL mismatch, and T1 pelvic angle (TPA) were obtained pre-operatively, postoperatively, and at last follow-up. Patients were excluded if follow-up was less than 6&#x2009;months. Adaptive spine intelligence software was utilized to predict post-operative sagittal alignment which was compared with observed measurements. Student&#x2019;s and paired t-tests were performed to determine significant mean differences for continuous variables and chi-square for categorical variables.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Thirty-six patients in the surgeon contoured cohort (average last follow-up&#x2009;=&#x2009;11.3&#x2009;months) and 22 in the pre-contoured cohort (average last follow-up&#x2009;=&#x2009;9.7&#x2009;months) were included. No significant differences were noted with regard to demographics, Lenke classification, preoperative radiographic measurements, number of fused levels and osteotomies, EBL, surgical time, and overall total SRS-22 scores at last follow-up. TK was between 20 and 40&#x2009;degrees in 95.5% of patients with pre-contoured rods versus 61.1% of patients with surgeon contoured rods at last follow-up (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.004). PI-LL mismatch was within 10&#x2009;degrees postoperatively in 72.7% of patients in the pre-contoured cohort versus 33.3% of patients in the surgeon contoured cohort (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.004). Other radiographic measurements were similar. Average differences between AI predicted and observed values for the PC group were 3.7 for TK (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.005), 8.7 for LL (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), &#x2212;7.6 for PI-LL mismatch (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002), and &#x2212;2.6 for TPA (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.112).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> AI and pre-contoured rods help achieve global sagittal balance with excellent accuracy and notably improved kyphosis restoration and PI-LL mismatch than surgeon contoured rods in AIS patients.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Patient-specific pre-contoured rods help achieve more optimal global sagittal balance than surgeon contoured rods in AIS.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) with thoracic curves is associated with reduced pulmonary function preoperatively. It remains unclear how much pulmonary improvement can be obtained using pedicle screw instrumentation at long-term follow-up.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Out of 64 consecutively surgically treated patients with thoracic AIS (Lenke 1-4, 6) using pedicle screw instrumentation, 50 (mean age at surgery 14.7&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1.9&#x2009;years, 44 females) participated in a prospective 10-year follow-up study (mean FU, 12.2&#x2009;years). Preoperative major curve averaged 57&#xB0; (SD, 8.5&#xB0;) with a remaining curve of 15&#xB0; (SD, 6.3&#xB0;) at 10-year follow-up. They were evaluated using clinical examination, spinal radiographs, and spirometry preoperatively and at 10-year follow-up. The preoperative percentage predicted values were adjusted for the height loss caused by the scoliosis according to curve size.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Preoperatively, 49% (20/41) had forced vital capacity (FVC) or forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) below 80% of the predicted normal values representing pulmonary function impairment. FVC improved from preoperative 3.29&#x2009;L (SD, 0.78&#x2009;L) to 3.87&#x2009;L (0.79&#x2009;L) at 10-year follow-up (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). This improvement averaged 510&#x2009;mL (SD, 560&#x2009;mL) in patients having both preoperative and 10-year follow-up measurements available. The percentage predicted values for FVC showed an improvement from 83% preoperatively to 86% at 10-year follow-up (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.048). At 10-year follow-up, 38% (19/50) of the patients had FVC or FEV1 below 80% of the predicted values.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Lung volumes improved by a mean of 510&#x2009;mL from preoperative to 10-year follow-up in patients undergoing pedicle screw instrumentation for thoracic AIS. Despite improvement of absolute values, one-third of the patients fulfilled the criteria for pulmonary function impairment at 10-year follow-up.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Preoperatively, 49% of the AIS patients with thoracic curves showed impairment in pulmonary function. After surgical correction of the scoliosis and a 10-year follow-up, 38% still fulfill the criteria for restrictive lung disease.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Following growing instrumentation for early-onset scoliosis (EOS), patients often undergo PCO at the time of conversion to definitive fusion. Their efficacy may be limited following prior instrumentation. Our purpose was to determine whether PCO at the time of conversion to definitive fusion in EOS graduates impacts outcomes.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Patients from a multicenter database undergoing growing rod instrumentation conversion to definitive fusion were grouped by those that did or did not have PCO. Patients with inadequate radiographs, &lt;2&#x2009;years of follow-up, or three-column osteotomies at the time of fusion were excluded.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 839 EOS patients who underwent conversion to definitive fusion met the inclusion criteria. In total, 176 (21%) patients had PCOs and 663 (79%) did not. The age at index surgery was younger (6.6 versus 7.4&#x2009;years, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0009) and the mean duration of growing instrumentation was greater (6.1 versus 5.5&#x2009;years, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.009) in the PCO group. Prior to fusion, curve magnitude was similar between the groups (PCO&#x2009;=&#x2009;61.9&#x2009;degrees, no PCO&#x2009;=&#x2009;59.3&#x2009;degrees, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.18). For the PCO group, on average, 4.4 osteotomies (range: 1&#x2013;12) were performed. EBL (PCO&#x2009;=&#x2009;821 cc versus no PCO&#x2009;=&#x2009;752 cc, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01) and surgical time (PCO&#x2009;=&#x2009;403&#x2009;min versus no PCO&#x2009;=&#x2009;348&#x2009;min, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01) were greater in the PCO group. Postoperatively, mean major curve magnitude and curve correction were similar between the two groups (mean correction PCO&#x2009;=&#x2009;16.5, no PCO&#x2009;=&#x2009;14.4&#x2009;degrees, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.19). However, accounting for preoperative curve magnitude, there was a relationship between number of PCOs and curve correction (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.04). Mean correction was 14.2&#x2009;degrees with 1&#x2013;4 osteotomies, 19.0&#x2009;degrees with 5&#x2013;8 osteotomies, and 23.9&#x2009;degrees with 9&#x2013;12 osteotomies. Overall, mean correction per osteotomy was 4.5&#x2009;degrees. There was no relationship between degrees of correction per osteotomy and duration of instrumentation prior to conversion (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.12). Postoperative complications at 2&#x2009;years were similar between groups (PCO&#x2009;=&#x2009;25% versus no PCO&#x2009;=&#x2009;27%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.63).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> EOS graduates achieved minimal correction at the time of conversion regardless of whether PCOs were performed. PCOs were associated with increased EBL and operative time, but similar complication rate. More PCOs resulted in more correction, albeit &lt;10&#x2009;degrees/osteotomy anticipated in a previously uninstrumented spine.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> PCOs at the time of conversion to fusion in growing rod graduates resulted in less than half of the correction reported in previously uninstrumented spines.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Following Mehta cast treatment for idiopathic early-onset scoliosis (IEOS), there is no consensus on the value of continued orthotic management, specifically regarding preventing progression. We wished to compare outcomes for patients treated with a brace following cast discontinuation compared to those who were simply observed.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> From a single institution database of IEOS patients treated by casting, we identified 73 patients treated initially by Mehta casts. At completion of the casting program, patients were either observed or prescribed a thoracolumbar sacral orthosis (TLSO) to continue non-operative treatment, at the discretion of the treating physician. We recorded patient demographics, cast details and length of treatment, and curve magnitudes at time points pre-cast, at cast discontinuance, and at last follow-up or until another form of treatment was initiated. We hypothesized that patients doing braces post-casting would achieve/maintain better curve control long term. Bracing was defined &#x201C;successful&#x201D; if no other treatment was required.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Seventy-three patients with mean age of 22.2&#x2009;months (7&#x2013;62&#x2009;months) at cast initiation were studied. Five patients underwent surgery after cast discontinuance. Twelve patients with initial mean curve of 36&#xB0; (17&#xB0;&#x2013;70&#xB0;) were corrected to 16.1&#xB0; (1&#xB0;&#x2013;41&#xB0;) after final cast and then observed. Fifty-six patients with mean curve of 46&#xB0; (21&#xB0;&#x2013;89&#xB0;) at initiation were corrected to 28&#xB0; (1&#xB0;&#x2013;79&#xB0;) at cast discontinuance and then prescribed a TLSO which was worn for a mean of 5.8&#x2009;years (0&#x2013;15&#x2009;years). At last follow-up, 44 braced cases were considered &#x201C;success&#x201D; (79%) with mean curve of 19.4&#xB0;, while 12 braced cases failed with curves measuring 48&#xB0;, and further treatment (11 surgery, 1 re-cast) needed. Braces were discontinued in 25 patients with 16 remaining stable (no progression, mean curve 13.5&#xB0;) and 9 progressing 15&#xB0;, while 14/19 continuing bracing remained stable. One of 12 observed patients compared to 11/56 braced patients required surgery.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Bracing following cast treatment for IEOS was nearly 80% successful in avoiding further treatment even though curves at cast discontinuance were larger (28 versus 16) compared to observed cases.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> When cast treatment does not achieve correction &lt;20&#xB0;, continuing treatment with a brace appears to have benefit in avoiding surgery.</p>

        <p>LOE-Therapeutic-Level III</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Limited spinal fusion is a common surgical strategy in the treatment of congenital scoliosis. Due to the heterogeneity of deformity and treatment strategies, long-term outcomes, including the need for additional surgery, are poorly understood. The purpose of the study was to understand the rate and risk factors for reoperation following limited fusion for congenital scoliosis.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A single-center retrospective review of congenital scoliosis patients who were initially treated with a limited instrumented fusion was conducted. Curve progression, short and long-term complications, and need for additional spinal surgery were assessed. Risk factors for additional surgery were compared between patients who underwent additional surgery and patients who did not require additional surgery.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Thirty-six patients underwent limited instrumented fusion at an average age of 5&#x2009;years (SD: 2.5&#x2009;years). The mean number of levels fused was 3.5 (SD: 1.3). Index surgery location included cervical (6%), thoracic (64%), thoracolumbar (50%), lumbar (42%), and lumbosacral (11%). Seven (19.4%) of the patients had two areas of fusion (separated by unfused segments) treated at the index procedure. Average follow-up was 7.6&#x2009;years (range: 2.2&#x2013;14.1, SD: 3.4). Average curve magnitude improved from 50&#xB0; to 26&#xB0;, with a mean improvement of 18&#xB0; (range: 11.6&#xB0;&#x2013;23.9&#xB0;, SD: 18&#xB0;, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001). Nineteen patients (53%) required reoperation at a mean of 5.2&#x2009;years. The mean number of additional surgeries was 3.6 (SD: 3.4). Preoperative curve magnitude was greater in patients who had reoperation compared to patients who did not require reoperation (62&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;4.9 versus 38&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;4.7, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002). Age at index surgery, medical comorbidities, if all congenital anomalies were addressed during index procedure, number of levels fused, location of the index procedure, and postoperative curve magnitude did not differ between groups (Table 1).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Limited fusion for congenital scoliosis resulted in a 53% reoperation rate at a mean of 5.2&#x2009;years. Preoperative curve magnitude was associated with reoperation, while age, location, number of levels fused, and addressing all congenital anomalies at the index procedure did not differ between groups. These results suggest that surgeons should consider intervention at smaller curve magnitudes in patients with congenital scoliosis and counsel families that a one and done procedure is less likely with larger curves.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> The results of this study suggest that limited fusion should be considered prior to significant curve progression in patients with congenital scoliosis to minimize the need for additional surgery.</p>

        <p>LOE-Therapeutic-Level II</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Neuromuscular scoliosis (NMS) is the second most prevalent pediatric scoliosis etiology. The NMS population present unique challenges with larger curves and associated pelvic obliquity (PO), osteopenia, and greater comorbidities. The influence of implant density (ID) has undergone much investigation in the adolescent idiopathic scoliosis literature. These investigations have shown no significant difference in correction between low and high ID cohorts. It is however unknown how ID affects initial and long-term correction in NMS. We hypothesized that greater ID in posterior instrumented fusions (PIF) to the pelvis in NMS patients will achieve better coronal and sagittal correction with long-term durability.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective review of a prospectively collected multicenter NMS registry database was performed. All NMS patients undergoing upper thoracic to pelvis PIF with a minimum follow-up of 2&#x2009;years were included. ID was defined as the number of screws per level fused. Patients were divided into three groups: low density (LD; &#x2264;1.3 screws/level), medium density (MD; &#x2265;1.3 and &#x2264;1.6 screws/level), and high density (HD; &#x2265;1.6 screws/level). Demographic and radiographic data were collected to perform independent sample t-tests and cluster analysis for correlation.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 235 patients (56 LD, 84 MD, 95 HD) were included. Baseline demographic characteristics were similar between cohorts including CPChild scores. There were mild preoperative major Cobb angle differences with no difference in PO (Table). Perioperative data was comparable between groups, with significantly increased operative times with higher ID (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) (Table). Two-year postoperative coronal plane and PO corrections demonstrated no between-group difference in correction regardless of ID (Table). Sagittal plane measurements demonstrated no statistically significant difference between groups at all time points. Similarly, no functional outcome differences as measured by CPChild were present at any time point in either group (Table).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Lower ID in NMS demonstrates comparable major curve correction and PO correction to higher ID constructs at 2&#x2009;years postoperatively with reduced operative time and equivalent functional outcomes.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Efforts to maximize balanced corrections achieve improved sitting balance, while minimizing operative time, complications, and cost are imperative in NMS management. Lower ID should be considered in neuromuscular scoliosis correction as both an effective surgical strategy and a potential source of significant cost reduction.</p>

        <p>LOE-Prognostic-Level II</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Patients with type 3 spinal cords are at greater risk for intraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM) alerts when undergoing thoracic scoliosis correction. The use of intraoperative traction during deformity correction is also associated with an increased risk of IONM alerts. The purpose of this study is to examine the interplay between spinal cord morphology and intraoperative traction.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> An institutional review board (IRB)-approved retrospective review of patients with major thoracic curves &#x2265;70&#xB0; who underwent spinal fusion from 2016 to 2022 at a single institution were reviewed. Patients without a preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were excluded, yielding 102 patients for review. Spinal cord morphology was determined by consensus of four observers using the criteria by Sielatycki et al.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Seventy-five (73.5%) patients were female, with an average age of 13.7&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;2&#x2009;years at surgery. Mean thoracic Cobb was 85&#xB0;&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;13&#xB0;. The average number of levels fused was 12&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1.5, implant density 1.5&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;0.3, estimated blood loss (EBL) 895&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;645&#x2009;mL, and total surgical time 314&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;112&#x2009;min. Eighty-seven patients had posterior spinal fusion (PSF), while 15 had an anterior spinal fusion (ASF)/PSF. Intraoperatively, traction was used in 15 patients. Sixteen patients had type 1 cords, 71 type 2, and 15 type 3. Seventeen patients had an IONM alert and surgery was aborted in three patients due to persistent loss of IONM. Patients with type 3 cords were more likely to have an IONM alert than those with type 2 cords (46.7% versus 14.1%, odds ratio (OR)&#x2009;=&#x2009;5.3, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.004). One hundred percent of patients with type 3 cords placed in traction intraoperatively had an IONM alerts versus 20% without traction (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.007). Multivariate regression found cord type (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;6.3, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02) and intraoperative traction (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;8.9, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02) to be significant risk factors for an IONM alert.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Type 2 and 3 spinal cords are found in 84% of patients with curves &#x2265;70&#xB0;. An IONM alert is six times more likely in patients with type 3 cord. Patients with a type 2 or type 3 cord are nine times more likely to have an IONM alert when traction is used intraoperatively and 100% of patients with a type 3 cord and intraoperative traction in this cohort experienced an IONM alert.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> The use of intraoperative traction should be carefully considered in patients with a thoracic curve &#x2265;70&#xB0;, especially if a preoperative MRI demonstrates type 3 cord morphology.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> When treating thoracolumbar kyphosis (TLK) in children with achondroplasia, predicting outcomes, correction, and surgical complications is essential. There is limited literature clearly describing the treatment and risk profiles among different types of TLK. This study aimed to classify deformities of the thoracolumbar junction, describe effective operative treatment, and compare surgical complications.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A single-center retrospective review at a quaternary referral center was performed from 2004 to 2021. Inclusion criteria consisted of achondroplasia diagnosis, TLK, symptomatic spinal stenosis, surgical treatment, and at least 1&#x2009;year of follow-up. Patient demographics, clinical notes, and radiographs were analyzed. Post-operative complications were classified by Clavien-Dindo System (CDS). Intra-observer reliability was measured with Cohen&#x2019;s kappa coefficient, and interobserver reliability with Fleiss&#x2019; kappa coefficient.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Forty patients with achondroplasia and TLK requiring surgical spinal decompression and fusion were treated at an average age of 16&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;5&#x2009;years, with a mean follow-up of 5&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;4&#x2009;years. We identified four classes of patients: Class 1 involves gradual multi-level TLK with diffuse stenosis; Class 2 involves severe focal TLK associated with apical vertebral body wedging and localized stenosis, with a flattened or lordotic thoracic spine above; Class 3 involves severe post-laminectomy kyphosis; and Class 4 is a heterogeneous group with additional diagnoses related to TLK. The intra-observer kappa index of this classification was 0.90 (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), and the inter-observer was 0.83 (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). The Class 1 patients were treated with posterior spinal decompression and fusion (PSDF), while all others required a combination of PSDF, anterior spinal fusion, and posterior spinal osteotomies. Kyphosis correction rate averaged 81%, with 52.5% (21/40) rate of intraoperative complication. Class 1 patients had shorter surgical times and lowered estimated blood losses (Table 1). Classes 3 and 4 presented more major complications when compared to classes 1 and 2 (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.45).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Treatment of TLK and symptomatic spinal stenosis in patients with achondroplasia can involve complex correction techniques and has a high rate of complication. Surgical options and risk can be stratified based on this reliable TLK classification system. With improved communication and preoperative planning, patients with achondroplasia and TLK can be successfully managed with excellent correction and managed risk.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This novel classification of TLK in achondroplasia has high inter-observer reliability and can help surgeons better educate and treat these challenging patients.</p>

</p>
        <p>LOE-Prognostic-Level II</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Curve flexibility is an important variable for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) outcomes. This study sought to determine the distribution of flexibility in a multicenter AIS cohort and investigate associated characteristics. It was hypothesized that flexibility would be normally distributed and would correlate with patient characteristics such as body mass index (BMI), curve pattern, and skeletal maturity.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Surgical AIS patients enrolled in a Harms Study Group (HSG) center were included. Flexibility was measured using lateral bending radiographs. The distribution was graphed using SPSS, and the relationship between flexibility and other parameters was assessed using t and chi-square tests. Pearson&#x2019;s R was used for regression analysis.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 4574 patients (mean age: 14.5&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;2.2&#x2009;years, 80.5% female) met the inclusion criteria. Mean flexibility was 72.0%&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;11.6%. Both primary thoracic (Lenke 1&#x2009;+&#x2009;2, N&#x2009;=&#x2009;2895) and primary lumbar curves (Lenke 5&#x2009;+&#x2009;6, N&#x2009;=&#x2009;1030) followed a normal distribution. Mean thoracic curve flexibility was significantly higher than primary lumbar curve flexibility (71.4% versus 68.98%, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Flexibility was inversely correlated with both higher age (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002) and increased skeletal maturity (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.003). Patients who have a healthy weight had more flexible curves than those who were overweight (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.019). Interestingly, and unanticipated, better Scoliosis Research Society (SRS)-22 and SRS-24 scores were associated with lower flexibility (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.03, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01). Not associated with curve flexibility were sex (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.124), weight (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.536), and height (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.121). Surprisingly, thoracic curves were more flexible than lumbar curves (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Increased BMI was associated with decreased flexibility in thoracic curves (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), but not with lumbar curves (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.963). In addition, for thoracic curves, those with a lumbar A modifier were significantly more flexible than B (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) and C (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) types. For sagittal parameters, normo-kyphotic and hypo-kyphotic curves were more flexible than hyperkyphotic curves (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Flexibility follows a normal distribution in AIS patients, as shown in the attached figure. Older, more skeletally mature patients had less flexibility. Interestingly, thoracic curves were more flexible than lumbar curves, and only thoracic flexibility varied with BMI. In addition, higher SRS scores were associated with less flexible curves.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This study describes a normal distribution of flexibility in a large population of surgical AIS patients. It also confirms previously described relationships between flexibility and various patient characteristics (age, maturity, BMI) with a significantly larger sample size than previous studies, as well as describing several new factors that correlate with curve flexibility.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> The ability to accurately predict growth is crucial in treating the growing spine. The Sanders Maturation Stage (SMS) 2&#x2013;4 represents periods of rapid growth and are key stages for growth modulation surgery. A detailed assessment of spine growth during these stages is imperative and is lacking. This study aimed to evaluate the spine and total body height growth through SMS 2, 3A, 3B, and 4 and to assess scoliosis progression during this period.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> In this single-center retrospective case-control study, consecutive patients with idiopathic scoliosis staged SMS 2&#x2013;4 were analyzed from January 2013 to December 2022. T1-S1 spine height, total body height, and curve magnitude were measured at each visit. Spine and total body height velocity and curve progression rate were assessed between the initial and first follow-up visit (6&#x2013;12&#x2009;months). For those observed until skeletal maturity (Risser 4+ or 5), height gain and curve progression were evaluated. Considering height loss due to scoliosis, spine and total body height were corrected for curve magnitude using validated formulas. For statistical comparisons between the groups, the Kruskal&#x2013;Wallis test was used, followed by Bonferroni post hoc analysis.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> The study included 525 patients (68% girls, mean age: 12.4&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1.4) and 2082 radiographs. Spine height velocity peaked during SMS 3A (2.6&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;0.8&#x2009;mm/month), being approximately 1.3 times that of SMS 2 (2.0&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;0.9&#x2009;mm/month), 1.5 times that of SMS 3B (1.7&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;0.6&#x2009;mm/month), and 1.7 times that of SMS4 (1.5&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;0.7&#x2009;mm/month) (Figure 1a). SMS 2 and SMS 3A had comparable total body height velocities (6.3&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;2.2&#x2009;mm/month; 6.4&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1.7&#x2009;mm/month, respectively), both surpassing SMS 3B (4.8&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;2.0&#x2009;mm/month) and SMS 4 (3.5&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1.6&#x2009;mm/month) (Figure 1b). Curve progression rates were consistent across the subtypes. Among those observed until skeletal maturity, SMS 2 had the highest spine and total body height gains, with declines noted as SMS advanced. Curve progression was greatest in SMS 2 (16&#xB0;&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;14&#xB0;), followed by SMS 3A (11&#xB0;&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;12&#xB0;), with SMS 3B and SMS 4 being similar (7&#xB0;&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;9&#xB0;; 6&#xB0;&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;9&#xB0;, respectively) (Figure 2).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This investigation revealed the spine grows fastest during SMS 3A and suggests that leg growth peaks at SMS 2. SMS 2 demonstrated the highest potential for both spine and total body height growth, as well as curve progression. These insights are crucial for determining intervention timing in scoliosis treatment, including decisions on bracing, surgery, and selecting between fusion or growth modulation.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This study identifies the pivotal SMS where spine and leg growth peak, facilitating more precise timing of treatment in idiopathic scoliosis and potentially guiding more successful outcomes.</p>

        <p>LOE-Economic-Level III</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Bracing moderate curvatures in skeletally immature idiopathic scoliosis patients is known to minimize the risk of curve progression to surgical range. Unfortunately, late referrals are common with more patients presenting as surgical versus ideal brace candidates. This study analyzes the total treatment cost differential between adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) patients who at initial consultation are ideal brace candidates versus late referrals.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> This is a retrospective review and cost analysis of AIS patients seen for initial consultation in 2014 who were either a late referral or an ideal brace candidate. Late referrals were defined as 50+&#xB0; curvatures or over 40&#xB0; and &#x2264;Risser 2. Ideal brace candidates were defined as 25&#xB0;&#x2013;40&#xB0; curves, &#x2264;Risser 2. Patient medical records were reviewed to determine progression in brace candidates to surgical range, up to 5&#x2009;years after initial visit or time. Total costs assumed all curves 50+&#xB0; would at some point have surgery. In addition to the cost of a brace or a surgical procedure, total treatment costs considered typical number of clinic visits (including associated travel, parking, meals, and loss of income costs for family) and spine X-rays obtained.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Within this cohort, 63 patients met ideal brace indications (17%) compared to 103 patients considered late referral (28%) (Scenario 1). The average total cost per patient for brace treatment was calculated at $13,459 versus $68,009 for surgical treatment. Within the 5-year study period, 10 ideal brace candidates progressed to 50+&#xB0; curvatures and 5 were lost to follow-up. In 2014, the theoretical total cost for ideal brace candidates was $1,868,052 versus $700,492 for late referrals (Scenario 1). If the late referrals seen that year were instead seen as ideal brace candidates, the total cost of treatment, including surgical costs for patients expected to progress despite brace treatment, would be $4,954,554, a cost savings of $3,918,373.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The total treatment cost of a late AIS referral is 56% more than the treatment cost of an ideal brace candidate. Early diagnosis and treatment are significantly more cost-effective.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> These findings underscore the financial consequences of late AIS diagnosis, emphasizing the need for early detection to reduce the cost burden. It is expected that the cost differential is underestimated as longer than recommended wait times, if applicable, and the inherent re-operation rate are not considered.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> A variety of brace options exist for the management of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). While institutional or surgeon&#x2019;s preferences abound, there is sparse literature comparing brace efficacy.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective review of patients aged 10&#x2013;18 with AIS of 20&#xB0;&#x2013;45&#xB0; who were Risser 0&#x2013;2 at initiation of treatment treated at a single center using a single orthotics team was performed. Patients were included if they had either completed brace treatment AND had a minimum of 6-month out of brace follow-up OR had undergone surgery. Brace success was defined as curve progression &lt;6&#x2009;degrees without the need for surgery. Patients were treated with a Providence nighttime brace (PNB), Boston-style TLSO (BB), or Rigo-Cheneau (RC) custom brace. Brace wear was determined by the treating physician.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Patients treated with 32 PNB, 37 BB, and 30 RC braces met all inclusion criteria. Overall, 44 patients (44%) progressed &gt;6&#xB0; and 18 patients (18 %) progressed to surgery. Eighty-eight percent were female, with an average age at brace initiation of 12.0&#x2009;years. Sixty-two percent of females were premenarchal at the onset of bracing, 66% were Risser 0, and 34% Risser 1 or 2. Thoracic, thoracolumbar, and lumbar curves averaged 27&#xB0;&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;7&#xB0;, 28&#xB0;&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;6&#xB0;, and 26&#xB0;&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;6&#xB0; at initiation. Thoracic curve correction was 46%&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;34% compared to thoracolumbar curves 73%&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;36%. PB were worn at nighttime only (8&#x2013;10&#x2009;h) while BB and RC were worn for part of the day and night. Twenty-seven percent of patients treated with a BB progressed to surgery compared to 13% of RC and 13% of PNB patients (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.21). Among Risser 0 patients, 37% of BB patients progressed to surgery compared to 11% of RC (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.07) and 10% of PNB patients (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.03). Similar trends toward less efficacy in patients with BB were seen using curve magnitude increase &gt;6&#xB0;; however, these did not meet statistical significance. Multivariate regression analysis found that skeletally immature (R0) patients treated with a BB had a 5.6-fold higher risk of surgery than RC or PNB (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.04) and a 2.8-fold higher risk of curve progression (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.09). This difference was not seen in Risser 1 or 2 patients.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Skeletally immature patients (Risser 0) treated with a Boston brace were nearly six times more likely to require surgery compared to those treated with a Rigo-Chenault or Providence brace. Patients who were Risser 1 or 2 were successfully treated in any of the three braces.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Rigo-Chenault and Providence bracing were more successful than Boston braces for skeletally immature patients with AIS.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> While in-brace coronal plane correction is commonly used as a proxy for brace efficacy, emerging evidence supports the importance of three-dimensional (3D) in-brace correction for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) patients. This study investigated the relationship between axial plane parameters and treatment failure in patients at a single center undergoing brace treatment for AIS. We hypothesize that AIS patients with large in-brace axial vertebral rotation (AVR) and/or poor improvement in AVR with bracing would have increased risk of treatment failure.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> AIS patients (Sanders 1&#x2013;5) undergoing Rigo-Ch&#xEA;neau bracing at a single institution were included. AVR was determined by utilizing pre-brace and in-brace (3D) spinal reconstructions based on biplanar low-dose EOS&#xAE; radiographs. The primary outcome was treatment failure defined as coronal curve progression &gt;5&#xB0;. Minimum follow-up was 2&#x2009;years.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Seventy-five patients (61/75, 81% female) were included in the final cohort. Mean age at bracing initiation was 12.8&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1.3&#x2009;years and patients had a pre-brace major curve of 31.0&#xB0;&#xB0;&#xB1;&#x2009;6.5&#xB0;. Twenty-five (33%; six males, 19 females) patients experienced curve progression &gt;5&#xB0;, and 18/25 required surgical intervention. The treatment failure group had larger in-brace absolute AVR than the success group (5.8&#xB0;&#xB1;&#x2009;4.1&#xB0; versus 9.9&#xB0;&#xB1;&#x2009;7.6&#xB0;, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.003), but also larger initial coronal curve measures. The magnitude of in-brace AVR did not appear to be associated with treatment failure after adjusting for pre-brace major curve (hazard ratio (HR): 0.99, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.94&#x2013;1.05, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.833). After adjusting for pre-brace major coronal curve, patients with improvement of AVR with bracing had an 85% risk reduction in treatment failure versus those without improvement (HR: 0.15, 95% CI: 0.02&#x2013;1.13, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.066). At final follow-up, 42/50 (84%) patients who did not progress had a Sanders &#x2265;7.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> While absolute in-brace rotation was not an independent predictor of curve progression (due to its correlation with curve magnitude), improved AVR with bracing was a significant predictor of curve progression.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This study is the first step toward investigating the interplay between 3D parameters, skeletal maturity, compliance, and brace efficacy, setting the stage for a future prospective multi-center study with adequate design and power.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Bracing is the primary non-surgical treatment for patients with idiopathic scoliosis (IS). While the TLSO brace remains the gold standard of treatment, Rigo-Cheneau (RC) and Providence (PROV) nighttime braces are being used more often due to a perceived increased level of comfort/ease of wear. The goal of this study was to examine compliance rates and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) for each type of brace.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Retrospective review of patients treated in a brace for IS at a single institution from 2021 to 2023. Patients with compliance data, pre-treatment PROMIS scores, and post-treatment PROMIS scores were included. Those with prior treatment (casting, bracing) or non-idiopathic etiologies were excluded.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> One hundred and twenty-seven patients were identified, of whom 95 (78%) were female. Eighty patients were treated with a TLSO and 47 with a PROV. The average compliance rate was 83% and was higher for PROV (84%) than for TLSO (70%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.03). Patients who were noncompliant with bracing (&lt;80%) had worse PROMIS anxiety scores than those who were compliant (41 versus 37, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.005) at brace prescription, 6&#x2009;months after brace initiation (41 versus 36, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.006), 1&#x2009;year after brace initiation (40 versus 35, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.04), and at their latest follow-up (39 versus 36, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.03). Twenty-two of the 80 TLSO patients were treated with a RC. There was no difference in PROMIS scores between the TLSO and RC groups. There was a difference between compliance rates for PROV, TLSO, and RC patients (83.5% versus 75% versus 55% respectively, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.006). Four patients in the cohort went on to surgery. All four were in the TLSO group and two were noncompliant with bracing. Patients who failed bracing had worse PROMIS anxiety scores than those who were still in their brace at latest follow-up (49.5 versus 38.2, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Patients treated with nighttime only bracing have better compliance rates, but similar PROMIS scores compared to those treated with TLSO braces. Patients who are noncompliant with brace wear have worse PROMIS anxiety scores at all time points during bracing, including brace prescription. RC braces do not seem to offer any benefit over traditional TLSO braces in terms of PROMIS scores or brace compliance.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> IS patients with abnormal PROMIS anxiety scores are more likely to be non-compliant with bracing. Identification of patients with anxiety prior to the start of bracing may allow for the opportunity to intervene to increase compliance and may also serve as a prognostic indicator for the success of bracing.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> The iliolumbar angle (ILA, measured between L4 superior endplate and bi-iliac crest line) is an important parameter in Lenke 5 and 6 curves. Assessing its flexibility preoperatively is key to define the surgical strategy and determine the distal level of fusion (LIV). Ending on L4 is always preferable for motion preservation, but an imperfect correction can also lead to distal disk degeneration or coronal imbalance. Reduction rates have recently improved in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), due to a greater flexibility than adults and modern instrumentation. The objective of this study was therefore to assess the postoperative outcomes of AIS patients with structural lumbar curves, associated with non-reducible ILA.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> All consecutive AIS patients with Lenke 5 or 6 curves, treated by a posterior fusion ending on L4 between January 2017 and January 2022, were included. A minimum follow-up of 18&#x2009;months was required. Non-reducible ILA (NR group) was defined as &gt;10&#xB0; on standing radiographs AND a reducibility &lt;50% on bending films. A control group of reducible ILA (R group) was also analyzed. After independent radiological analysis, postoperative results were classified as follows: excellent if postoperative ILA was &lt;5&#xB0;, acceptable between 5&#xB0; and 10&#xB0; with maintained coronal balance (T1-CSVL&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;2&#x2009;cm), and poor if &gt;10&#xB0; or if coronal imbalance &gt;2&#x2009;cm. Scoliosis Research Society (SRS) scores at follow-up were also compared.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 122 patients were enrolled, with 36 patients (30%) included in the NR group. Preoperative ILA was significantly greater in the NR group (20&#xB0;&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;4&#xB0; versus 15&#xB0;&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;6&#xB0;, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Mean lumbar Cobb angles were significantly reduced postoperatively in both groups, with no significant difference between NR and R groups (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.2). ILA was significantly reduced in both groups after surgery (from 20&#xB0;&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;4&#xB0; to 5.7&#xB0;&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;3&#xB0; in NR group, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05, and from 15&#xB0;&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;6&#xB0; to 5.1&#xB0;&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;3&#xB0; in R group, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). No significant difference was found between groups regarding postoperative ILA (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.2). In the NR group, excellent, acceptable, and poor outcomes were achieved in, respectively, 52%, 32%, and 16% of the cases, without significant impact on SRS scores. R group had fewer poor outcomes at follow-up (5%), but the difference did not reach significance. No correlation was found between ILA correction and the demographic or preoperative radiological measures.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Surgery is efficient to restore L4 frontal tilt in AIS patients with main lumbar curves, and a fusion to L4 can still be proposed even if ILA appears non-reducible on preoperative radiographs.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Level of evidence&#x2014;III&#x2014;retrospective cohort study.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Perioperative blood loss in surgical treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a major risk. However, with advancements to blood management strategies (intraoperative cell salvage; tranexamic acid), risk of perioperative transfusion has diminished. Despite low rates of symptomatic acute anemia, routine laboratory testing on post-operative day 1 (POD1) and beyond are still commonplace.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> We performed a retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients aged 11&#x2013;19 with AIS who underwent posterior spinal fusion at a single institution. Univariable logistic regression was utilized to determine whether factors were associated with hematocrit &#x2264;22% on POD1 or a postoperative transfusion. Firth&#x2019;s penalized logistic regression was used for any separation in the data. Youden&#x2019;s index was utilized to determine the optimal point on the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve that maximizes both sensitivity and specificity.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Among 527 patients included in this study, only eight had POD1 hematocrit &#x2264;22%; none underwent transfusion. These patients had lower last intraoperative hematocrit levels compared to patients with POD1 hematocrit &gt;22% (24.1% versus 31.5%, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), and there was no difference in preoperative hematocrit levels in this group (38.2% versus 39.8%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.11). Four patients underwent postoperative transfusion. Both preoperative hematocrit levels (34.0% versus 39.9%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001) and last intraoperative hematocrit levels (25.1% versus 31.4%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002) were lower compared to patients who did not undergo transfusion (Table 1). Intraoperative hematocrit &lt;26.2%, operative time of more than 35.8&#x2009;minutes per level fused, or cell salvage &lt;241 cc were significant risk factors for postoperative transfusion (relative risk of 105.6; 28.6; and 9.8, respectively) (Table 2). No other risk factors were associated with postoperative transfusion.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Postoperative transfusion after posterior spinal fusion for pediatric AIS is exceedingly rare. POD1 labs should be considered when last intraoperative hematocrit &lt;26%, operative time per level fused &gt;35&#x2009;minutes, or cell salvage amount &gt;241 cc. Otherwise, unless symptomatic, patients do not benefit from additional laboratory screening on POD1 and beyond.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Our results suggest that routine postoperative laboratory testing is unnecessary in patients undergoing surgery for AIS, particularly in the setting of advancements like TXA and cell salvage that have effectively limited the risk of blood loss during these procedures. Given the potential negative psychological effects of repeated blood draws on children, in addition to the risks typically associated with venipuncture, reducing the number of postoperative tests can improve the safety and the overall healthcare experience for both the child and their family.</p>

However, entirely opioid-free (OF) protocols have yet to be thoroughly evaluated in the pediatric population. The purpose of this study was to compare an OF pain management pathway with a traditional opioid-containing (OC) pathway in pediatric idiopathic scoliosis patients.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A database of patients who underwent instrumented PSF by a fellowship-trained pediatric orthopedic surgeon was reviewed retrospectively. Patients 10&#x2013;20&#x2009;years of age at the time of surgery who had a diagnosis of idiopathic scoliosis and underwent primary instrumented PSF were included. Patients were assigned to one of two groups, based on date of surgery: OF pathway (surgery between June 2019 and July 2020) or OC pathway (surgery between June 2018 and June 2019). Total morphine milligram equivalents (MME) were recorded, beginning once patients reached the inpatient unit postoperatively.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 93 patients (OF&#x2009;=&#x2009;37, OC&#x2009;=&#x2009;56) were included. Groups were similar with respect to age and body mass index (Table 1). Patients in the OF group had significantly more levels fused compared with patients in the OC group (11 versus 9.5, respectively; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0363), though both groups had a similar median length of stay (LOS; 2&#x2009;days, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.9613). For patients in the OF group, 19/37 (51.4%) required &#x201C;rescue&#x201D; doses of opioid medications during admission; 11/37 (29.7%) were prescribed opioids at discharge, compared with 55/56 (98.2%) in the OC group (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> An OF pathway following instrumented PSF for idiopathic scoliosis results in equivalent LOS and fewer opioids prescribed at discharge compared with an OC pathway.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that OF pain management is possible in this population.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Decadron has recently been shown to help significantly with pain control and decreased length of stay (LOS) in children with scoliosis undergoing posterior spinal instrumentation and fusion (PSIF). We have recently introduced a protocol utilizing postop decadron in addition to accelerated early physical therapy for both our idiopathic (IS) and neuromuscular (NM) scoliosis patients undergoing PSIF. The goal of the present study was to compare LOS in our most recent consecutive cohort of patients (WD) versus a previous patient cohort which did not have accelerated PT or decadron (ND). Secondary outcomes compared included morphine milligram equivalents (MME) and MME/kg in the first 24&#x2009;h postop, pain score, and infection rate.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective chart review of consecutive IS and NM patients with PSIF was performed. Patient demographics along with all intraoperative data and postoperative pain scores and opioid/PCA usage was recorded. Univariate (UV) and multivariable logistic regression analysis (MVLRA) was done to compare the cohorts with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Forty consecutive patients in the WD cohort were compared to a prior ND cohort composed of 68 consecutive patients. Cohorts were matched in all patient demographics, body mass index (BMI), levels fused, blood loss, and curve magnitude. Both UV and MVLRA showed no significant difference in maximum or median pain score or MME/kg. The WD cohort averaged 1.06 less days LOS (1.73 versus 2.79, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0007), and MVLRA also demonstrated that the WD protocol led to a 1&#x2009;day decreased odds ratio (OR) of LOS (CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;&#x2212;1.57 to &#x2212;0.44, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.006). MVLRA also showed 96% decreased OR of using a PCA (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.04, CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01&#x2013;0.13, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001), with only 37.5% of patients in the WD group requiring a PCA versus 89.7% in the ND group. The infection rate was 0% and 5%, respectively, in the ND and WD group; both UV and MVLRA showed no significant difference in infection rate between these groups.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This accelerated postoperative spine protocol led to a 38% decrease in LOS, with a 96% decreased OR of needing a PCA despite the MME/kg use not being significantly different. Pain scores were not significantly decreased in the WD group, likely due to these patients being more rapidly mobilized and thus more active during the first 24&#x2009;h postop.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This study demonstrates that, for the first time, hospital discharge on postoperative day 1 may be possible, with 70% of all NM and IS patients being discharged on postoperative day 1 over the past 10&#x2009;months.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Posterior fusion is the gold standard surgical procedure to correct progressive adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). Optimizing perioperative management is key to improve postoperative outcomes and to avoid the non-negligible risk of chronic pain reported after surgery. Preoperative back pain has been associated with poorer functional scores in adults, but the influence of this parameter remains unclear in the AIS population. The aim of this study was therefore to evaluate the incidence of pain in AIS surgical candidates and report the postoperative outcomes of patients with significant preoperative pain.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> All consecutive AIS patients who underwent posterior fusion between 2015 and 2022 were included, with a minimum 1-year follow-up. Demographic data, VAS, and Scoliosis Research Society (SRS)-22 scores were analyzed. Back pain group (BP) was defined as a preoperative VAS &gt;3, while the back pain free group (BPF) had a VAS &#x2264;3. Radiological measurements were performed before and after surgery by an independent observer. Scores and radiological measures were compared between groups before and after surgery.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 319 patients were enrolled, with 120 patients included in the BP group (pain incidence 37.6%). Mean follow-up was 31&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;18&#x2009;months. No difference was found between groups regarding mean preoperative main Cobb and correction rates (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.39 and p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.25, respectively). Preoperative VAS averaged 5.7&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1.4 in the BP group and 0.38&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;0.9 in BPF (p&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;0.01). No correlation was found between pain and any demographic or radiological parameter. After surgery, VAS was significantly reduced in the BP group (p&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;0.01), and 68% of the patients reported non-significant pain at latest follow-up. Mean SRS total scores significantly improved in BP patients (from 3.48&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;0.41 to 3.89&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;0.65, p&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;0.01). SRS satisfaction domains were significantly greater in patients initially painful (from 3.11&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;0.66 to 4.33&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;0.78, p&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;0.01). BP and BPF patients had no significant difference in postoperative VAS, SRS total, and all domains&#x2019; scores after surgery.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Back pain is a frequent and underestimated symptom in AIS surgical candidates, not correlated with deformity magnitude. It can be significantly improved after surgery, so its presence should not delay or contraindicate surgery. A comprehensive approach of the associated psychosocial factors remains necessary in painful patients, but outcomes and satisfaction are not negatively impacted.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Level of evidence&#x2014;III&#x2014;retrospective cohort study.</p>

        <p>LOE-Not Applicable-Not Applicable</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> The daily lives of adolescents have changed dramatically since the initial creation of the Scoliosis Research Society (SRS) questionnaire, with more time spent on social media and engaging in sedentary behaviors. We have previously demonstrated a decline in SRS scores over the last 2 decades for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) patients prior to surgery. Meanwhile, one would reasonably conclude that improvement of techniques in surgical scoliosis management should improve postop outcomes over this same time. The purpose of this study is to evaluate how 2-year postoperative SRS scores for surgical AIS patients have changed over 2 decades.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Retrospective review of consecutively enrolled AIS patients undergoing definitive fusion (DF) at a single institution between 2002 and 2022. Patients were included if they completed an SRS questionnaire between 21 and 49&#x2009;months postoperatively, classified as 2-year follow-up. A multivariate linear regression was performed with the outcome as the 2-year SRS domain and total scores and the variable of interest as the year the survey was completed. Variables included to minimize confounding were the corresponding preoperative SRS domain score, gender, race, body mass index (BMI), and age at surgery.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 788 patients met the inclusion criteria. Patients were 83.8% female, had a mean age at DF of 14.3&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;2.0&#x2009;years, and a mean preoperative major Cobb angle of 61.7&#xB0;&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;11.1&#xB0;. Of the potential confounding variables included, preoperative SRS score, body mass index (BMI), gender, and race contributed significantly to the model. Later (more recent) SRS completion years were associated with worse health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in the Mental Health domain (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;782, coefficient&#x2009;=&#x2009;&#x2212;0.009, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0432) and the Activity domain (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;782, coefficient&#x2009;=&#x2009;&#x2212;0.007, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0340) (Figure 1). The relationship between SRS completion year and SRS scores was not significant for Pain (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;785, coefficient&#x2009;=&#x2009;&#x2212;0.003, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.4680), Appearance (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;784, coefficient&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.005, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.2645), or Satisfaction (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;689, coefficient&#x2009;=&#x2009;&#x2212;0.003, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.4939).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Patients with AIS who underwent DF in more recent years are reporting worse postoperative HRQoL for both Activity and Mental Health. Extrinsic causes likely play a role. Whereas we previously showed declining preoperative SRS Pain and Appearance scores over time, the effects of surgery may mitigate this, as the 2-year postoperative scores have not worsened over time.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Healthcare providers should be cognizant of these downward trends and should consider using adjunct treatments to support postoperative patients with AIS, such as physical and psychological therapy. Similarly, when comparing postoperative patient-reported outcomes of scoliosis patients from different time periods, clinicians and researchers should be cautious of the confounding role that external, societal factors may play in adolescents&#x2019; lives.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> The Ponseti method is the global gold standard treatment for clubfoot. However, recurrence rates, treatment of recurrence, and the frequency of further interventions vary widely. All increase with duration of follow-up. There is a lack of high-quality research investigating clinical and quality of life (QoL) outcomes in children with clubfoot and how they correlate with deformity recurrence. The aim of this study was to assess clinical and QoL outcomes in children with clubfoot treated by the Ponseti method using a standardized Core Outcome Set (COS) and compare these in children with and without relapse and in those requiring further treatment.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Eleven international clubfoot centers participated in this institutional review board (IRB)&#x2013;approved observational study. Data were collected from consecutive clinic patients from 1 June 2022 to 30 June 2023, with a minimum 5-year follow-up. A standardized proforma was used for data collection including demographics, information regarding primary presentation and treatment, and details of subsequent relapse and further treatment. The clubfoot COS incorporating 31 parameters of clinical and QoL outcomes was used. Data were pooled across hospital centers for analysis. A regression model was used to assess relationships between baseline variables and outcome measures and between the clinical and QoL outcomes.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 293 patients (432 feet), median age 89&#x2009;months (range, 72&#x2013;113), were included. The relapse rate was 37%, with more than one relapse in 13%. Treatment for relapse considered a standard part of the Ponseti journey (recasting, repeat tenotomy, and tibialis anterior tendon transfer (TATT)) was documented in 35% of cases. Soft tissue release and osteotomies were documented in 5.4% and 2.4% of cases, respectively. Predictors of relapse included higher age at follow-up, higher initial Pirani score, and poor evertor muscle activity. Relapse and further treatment were associated with poorer outcomes. The total score and the physical component of the Oxford Foot and Ankle Score were higher and the clinical examination better in children who did not experience relapse. Thirty-seven percent of the children were unable to squat. This was related to reduced ankle dorsiflexion.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Patients who were treated according to the Ponseti method experienced 37% relapse. Patients with no relapse had superior core outcomes.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This is the first multi-center study using a standardized COS following Ponseti clubfoot treatment. It distinguishes patients with and without relapse in terms of clinical outcomes and QoL. This tool can serve to compare treatment methods and outcomes, can facilitate information sharing, and sets expectations with families.</p>

        <p>LOE-Prognostic-Level II</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Achilles tenotomy (AT) during idiopathic clubfoot correction can be performed either in an outpatient clinic (OPC) or operating room (OR) setting. However, there is no clear consensus regarding where to perform AT to produce better outcomes without major complications. To the best of our knowledge, no randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted to compare these two settings. Research question: Is AT done in OR under general anesthesia (GA) better than in OPC under local anesthesia (LA)?</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Through block randomization, 40 idiopathic clubfoot cases were allotted equally to the OPC and OR groups. After satisfactory correction of midfoot cavus, forefoot adduction, and hindfoot varus using Ponseti casting, percutaneous scalpel AT was performed for correcting ankle equinus either in OPC or OR. Parental anxiety through the STAI questionnaire, self-designed surgeon satisfaction questionnaire, and ankle dorsiflexion at the final follow-up were assessed.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> The mean age in the OPC and OR groups were 4.18 and 5.03&#x2009;months, respectively. The mean number of casts was comparable between groups. The mean duration of the procedure was 19.80 and 53.50&#x2009;minutes in the OPC and OR groups, respectively (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). The mean infant&#x2013;mother separation time was 59.75&#x2009;minutes in the OR group. Intra-op bleeding was seen in three (15%) patients in the OPC group and one (5%) patient in the OR group; statistically insignificant (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.605) between groups. Parental anxiety during the initial presentation at the clinic and pre- and post-operative periods were comparable in both groups. The mean total surgeon satisfaction score favors OR (25.10) as their preferred setting in comparison to OPC (23.05) (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.009). The mean ankle dorsiflexion on 1-year follow-up in the OPC and OR groups was 17.80&#xB0; and 17.95&#xB0;, respectively.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> AT done in OPC under LA is a safe, cost-effective procedure with less infant&#x2013;mother separation time and decreased overall procedural duration. Also, this setting has comparable clinical outcomes and similar parental anxiety during the pre- and post-procedural period to that done under GA in the OR.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> AT during the Ponseti correction method in idiopathic clubfoot can be done safely, cost-effectively, and with less infant&#x2013;mother separation time in OPCs. OR setting shows no significant additional advantage for doing AT in idiopathic clubfoot except for surgeon satisfaction.</p>

        <p>LOE-Therapeutic-Level II</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Although numerous studies have assessed function of idiopathic clubfeet (CF) treated by the Ponseti method, few studies have assessed alterations in the normal foot of patients with unilateral CF imparted by Ponseti bracing. The purpose of this study was to identify pedobarographic differences in the unaffected foot of unilateral CF patients treated with the Ponseti abduction brace, and if those differences persist over time.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Patients with unilateral idiopathic clubfoot treated during infancy by either the Ponseti method (CF group) or the French Physical Therapy Method (PT group) were prospectively followed until 16&#x2009;years of age. Those in the CF group used abduction braces 23&#x2009;h a day for a minimum of 3&#x2009;months followed by nighttime brace wear until a minimum of 2&#x2009;years of age. Those in the PT group used a custom unilateral orthosis on only the affected foot during the maintenance phase of treatment. Pedobarographic assessment of the unaffected foot was collected longitudinally at 2, 5, 10, and 16&#x2009;years of age. Non-parametric Mann&#x2013;Whitney U tests were used to compare plantar contact area (CA%), mean force (MF%), and contact time (CT%) between groups.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Forty-four patients (19 in the CF group and 25 in the PT group) underwent pedobarographic assessment at all time intervals. The CF group demonstrated significantly higher MF% and CT% as a percentage of the rollover process in the medial and lateral midfoot at 2&#x2009;years of age. These differences, however, resolved by age 5, with no difference noted in plantar pressures between groups at age 16 (Table 1).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Abduction bracing of normal feet in patients with unilateral CF deformity results in measurable increases in midfoot plantar pressure and contact time during the brace phase of treatment indicating that bracing does impart an increased pes planus posture of the unaffected foot. These changes, however, appear to resolve following cessation of brace use.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Although abduction bracing of the unaffected foot in children with unilateral CF deformity following Ponseti casting does result in increased midfoot pressures, these changes are transient and are expected to resolve after brace discontinuation. This information should be reassuring to parents of unilateral CF patients concerned about the effect of abduction bracing on the normal foot.</p>

        <p>LOE-Therapeutic-Level IV</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Clubfoot is the most common musculoskeletal birth defect in the United States, and it is widely agreed upon that conservative management using the Ponseti method of casting is the most effective treatment, consisting of correction by manipulation and casting, Achilles tenotomy, and prevention of relapse by bracing. However, relapses can still occur and may result in significant long-term morbidity for patients if not managed appropriately. No current literature discusses long-term rate of relapses with most studies limited by smaller cohorts, short follow-up, and deviations from the original method making clinical conclusions difficult. The purpose of this study is to determine relapse rate of patients with congenital idiopathic clubfoot spanning 65&#x2009;years of practice.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> This is a retrospective cohort study of patients treated for clubfoot at a tertiary center between 1948 and 2013. A Kaplan&#x2013;Meier survivorship curve for relapse rate was used to evaluate relapse rate in patients with and without prior treatment, as well as for those adherent and non-adherents with brace treatment. Multivariate Cox models were used to assess which factors were significantly associated with relapse rate.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Of the 1580 feet in the population, we found that non-compliance with bracing during the maintenance phase is the largest risk factor for relapse. The relapse rate without prior treatment was 8.9% and with prior treatment, 18.9%. Non-adherence without prior treatment increased the relapse rate to 93.6%, and with prior treatment, 95.7%. Patient age, gender, family history, unilateral versus bilateral clubfoot, prior treatment, and indication for tenotomy were not significantly associated with relapse rate. However, a higher number of casts required for correction (&gt;7) and brace non-adherence were significant associated with relapse rate (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This study supports that proper technique and brace adherence lead to lower rates of relapse and further demonstrates that after the age of 5&#x2009;years, relapse occurs as low as 5%. Other studies provide highly variable relapse rates with shorter follow-up. This study provides information on risk for relapses, with the greatest risk factor being number of casts needed for correction and brace adherence over 65&#x2009;years of practice.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Many factors are described in the current literature to be associated with clubfoot relapse; however, this study with 65&#x2009;years of data shows that number of casts for correction and brace adherence are most significant factors for preventing relapse, with decreasing likelihood after the age of 5.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Recurrence in clubfoot after the Ponseti technique is a well-recognized phenomenon. The use of the anterior tibial tendon transfer (ATTT) is a well-documented technique for addressing dynamic supination following treatment. Despite its widespread use, there is a lack of comparative studies evaluating different fixation techniques for ATTT. Consequently, we conducted a multicenter study to assess and compare the outcomes of three techniques.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Three centers from three different continents collaborated in this comparative analysis. Children with dynamic supination after initial Ponseti treatment who underwent ATTT between 2008 and 2023 were included. Exclusion criteria were neuromuscular disease, associated syndromes, partial tendon transfer, and follow-up &lt;6&#x2009;months. A pull-through technique with suture over a button (Group A) was used in 52 patients (72 feet), a pull-through technique using an interference screw fixation (Group B) was used in 23 patients (26 feet), and a novel suture anchor technique (Group C) was used in 55 patients (65 feet). A retrospective review included demographics, surgical procedures, and outcomes (active contraction of the ATTT, recurrence, and postoperative complications). The comparison between the three groups was made with analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Kruskal&#x2013;Wallis tests. p-values of &lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 130 children (163 feet), were included. There were no statistically significant differences in age, sex, side, and isolated ATTT versus ATTT&#x2009;+&#x2009;additional surgery (soft tissue or bony) between groups. At final follow-up (mean, 42.0&#x2009;months), 28 patients (38 feet) experienced some form of relapse of any aspect of the clubfoot: Group A, 27.8% (20/72 feet), Group B, 27.6% (8/29 feet) and Group C, 15.4% (10/65 feet), p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.41. There were five postoperative complications directly related to the ATTT, comprising four cases in Group A (5.6%) and one in Group B (1.5%), p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.88. Of these complications, only one case from Group A included pull out of the transferred tendon. There were no cases of overcorrection.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> All three fixation techniques effectively secure the tibialis anterior tendon transfer in the pediatric population. The suture anchor technique may present a slightly lower recurrence and complication rate. Future large-scale studies are needed to validate these findings and provide further insights into optimal ATTT techniques.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> The suture anchor and screw techniques have demonstrated their utility in addressing recurrent dynamic supination. In situations where the tendon length may be insufficient or the bone dimensions are inadequate for a pull-through approach, the suture anchor technique stands as a safe and effective alternative.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Despite good initial results, 1.9% and 67% of the clubfoot patients treated with the Ponseti method might experience a relapse. In case repeated Ponseti treatment yields insufficient results, additional treatment might be necessary. Anterior distal tibial hemi-epiphysiodesis (ADTE) with eight plates has been proposed as treatment for recurrent equinus deformity. So far clinical results were inconsistent and mainly focused on correction during treatment. In the current project, we also evaluate outcome at least 1&#x2009;year after 8-plate removal as a resumption on the project earlier presented at EPOS.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> We included idiopathic clubfoot patients aged between 4 and 12&#x2009;years, who are initially treated with the Ponseti method and treated with hemi-epiphysiodesis between 2015 and 2022. Patients were assessed preoperatively at indication for 8-plate removal and if available at least 1&#x2009;year after 8-plate removal. A senior orthopedic surgeon specialized in clubfoot treatment determined passive ankle dorsiflexion. Furthermore, on standardized lateral radiographs, the anterior distal tibial angle (ADTA) was measured.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> The median treatment duration of 45 feet (31 patients, 42% female) was 22.7 (range: 9.4&#x2013;37.0) months. Both ankle dorsiflexion and ADTA improved during hemi-epiphysiodesis. From 23 of these feet also a radiological assessment at least 1-year follow-up after removal of hardware was available. The ADTA showed significant increase (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) after 8-plate removal, by modeling back to preoperative values. In the subgroup with 1-year follow-up available, no change in dorsiflexion was found. One patient undergoing bilateral hemi-epiphysiodesis experienced a wound infection and screw migration.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> ADTE with eight plates is an effective method to achieve slope correction. However, after 8-plate removal, regression of ADTA occurs. Physicians, parents, and patients should be informed about this mechanism which might result in different timing of the treatment and possibly the need for renewed hemi-epiphysiodesis. To what extent the degree of relapse is related to age and therefore potential for residual growth is still unclear. More clarity on this would provide insight into the timing of epiphysiodesis as relapse treatment for clubfeet patients with a recurrent equinus deformity.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> As far as we are aware, this is the first study showing a rebound effect of the ADTA after implant removal of an anterior distal tibial hemi-epiphysiodesis as a treatment for recurrent equinus deformity in Ponseti-treated clubfoot patients.</p>

        <p>LOE-Therapeutic-Level III</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Flexible flatfoot (FF) is a common pediatric condition that is mostly asymptomatic, and surgical intervention is only considered when painful FF is refractory to conservative treatment. Calcaneal lengthening osteotomy (CLO) is one of the most used procedures to address painful FF. Traditionally, Kirschner wires were used for fixation, but there has been a recent increase in the use of plates. We compared the clinical and radiographic outcomes of these two fixation methods.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> This single-center retrospective study included children aged 8&#x2013;18&#x2009;years with symptomatic FF that received CLO using K-wire or plate fixation. Primary outcomes include weight-bearing radiographic measurements and complications following surgery. Secondary outcomes included patient-reported outcomes. Statistical significance was held at 0.05.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Among 102 feet (65 patients), 42 feet (41.2%) underwent K-wire and 60 feet (58.8%) underwent plate fixation. No differences in casting duration (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.525) and time to radiographic healing (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.17) were noted. Total complications were higher in the plate cohort (12 versus 2, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.04) due to a higher rate of reoperations (16.7%) for hardware-related pain (10 versus 0; odds ratio (OR)&#x2009;=&#x2009;17.74, 95% confidence interval (CI)&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.01&#x2013;310.54, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05), and infection rates were similar. Both interventions significantly improved (p&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;0.001) anteroposterior (AP) talo-first metatarsal and calcaneal pitch angles. Irrespective of intervention, CLO significantly improved pain at 6&#x2009;months and mobility scores at 12&#x2009;months. Neither modality demonstrated superior pain or mobility scores at final follow-up.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Both K-wire and plate fixations lead to similar radiographic and functional outcomes after CLO in painful, pediatric flatfeet. Compared to K-wire fixation, plates cause a 17.7-fold increased risk of reoperations for painful hardware, with 16.7% of plated cases requiring reoperation.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Noting this, along with the higher costs associated with using plates, our study advocates for K-wire fixation for children undergoing CLO.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> The Evans osteotomy is a lateral column lengthening procedure of the calcaneus that is commonly used to correct flatfoot deformities. Currently, there is no consensus on whether fixation is needed when performing this osteotomy. Furthermore, the use of large sized grafts for the Evans osteotomy has been associated with degeneration of the calcaneocuboid joint. The aim of this study was to determine the union rate of an unfixed Evans osteotomy with the use of a relatively small allograft wedge performed in pediatric patients undergoing flexible flatfoot reconstruction.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> We retrospectively reviewed 39 pediatric patients with idiopathic symptomatic flatfoot deformity who underwent 46 unfixed Evans osteotomies with allogenic bone graft for flatfoot reconstruction between March 2013 and September 2017, with a mean follow-up of 49 (range, 9.9&#x2013;243.9) weeks. Hospital record, preoperative and follow-up radiographs, and complications were reviewed.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Of the 46 feet, 42 (91.3%) underwent a double calcaneal osteotomy with an associated medial displacement calcaneal osteotomy (MDCO). Mean graft wedge size was 7.2&#x2009;mm (SD&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.6&#x2009;mm). The mean time to union was 10.3 (range, 6.7&#x2013;13.9; SD&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.5) weeks (Table 1). There were no nonunions. One patient (one foot) had persistent sinus tarsi pain requiring arthroscopic debridement of fibrosis and graft prominence. Significant improvement was observed in all radiographic parameters at final follow-up, including calcaneal pitch, talonavicular uncoverage, anteroposterior and lateral talo-first metatarsal angle, and lateral column length (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05) (Table 2). Postoperative calcaneocuboid subluxation occurred in 70% of feet, with no correlation with wedge size (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.53). Mean change in calcaneocuboid subluxation at final follow-up was 1.07&#x2009;mm (SD&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.18), with postoperative calcaneocuboid subluxation diminishing over time (Table 3). There was also no correlation between wedge size and change in lateral column length (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.45).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> An unfixed Evans osteotomy for symptomatic flatfoot deformity resulted in a significant improvement in the radiographic alignment of the foot with no nonunion at final follow-up. Although calcaneocuboid subluxation was found in 70% of feet, it was small in magnitude and diminished with time. Mean graft size in our cohort was smaller than that reported by other studies.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> No fixation of the Evans osteotomy was required to achieve a 100% union rate with minimal calcaneocuboid subluxation in this pediatric population. Performing adjunctive procedures may allow for less than 10&#x2009;mm of lengthening with this procedure.</p>

        <p>LOE-Diagnostic-Level IV</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> While evaluation of an underlying neurologic disorder in children with cavovarus foot deformity (CVD) is of great importance, no standardized method of neurologic assessment exists. Moreover, the yield of commonly used diagnostic measures remains unstudied. This study aims to compare the diagnostic yield of traditional methods of neurologic assessment for patients with CVD of unknown etiology to a more advanced diagnostic algorithm (ADA).</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> An institutional review board (IRB)-approved retrospective review of patients presenting to a single pediatric tertiary care center for bilateral or unilateral CVD was performed over a 19-year period. Patients with a known etiology for their deformity or pre-existing neurologic or syndromic diagnoses were excluded. Neurologic evaluation of all remaining patients was conducted by a pediatric neurologist using one of two diagnostic algorithms. The traditional diagnostic algorithm (TDA) consisted of clinical examination, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and spinal cord, and/or electromyography (EMG)/nerve conduction velocity (NCV). The ADA included all components of the TDA in addition to genetic testing, and/or muscle/nerve biopsy and/or repeat EMG/NCV testing when initial workup remained negative. These diagnostic algorithms were compared regarding determination of an underlying etiology for CVD.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 108 patients (average age 9.7&#x2009;years) were included. Ninety-six patients were assessed via the TDA which detected an underlying neurologic diagnosis in 56 (58%) patients. Of these, 15 had central neurologic disease, 35 had peripheral neuropathies, and 6 had combined central and peripheral neuropathology. Of the 40 patients in whom no diagnosis was made using the TDA, 21 were further assessed using the ADA which revealed a diagnosis in 15 (71%) patients, thereby increasing the diagnostic yield to 71/77 patients (92%) when the ADA was incorporated and 71/96 (74%) overall. Moreover, 23 of 41 patients (56%) diagnosed with an unspecified polyneuropathy by TDA received a more specific diagnosis when TDA was combined with ADA. Definitive diagnosis was achieved solely by genetic testing without utilization of the TDA in 12 patients, 75% of whom had variants of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Neurologic etiology remains undetected in 42% of children with CVD using solely neuroaxis imaging and electrodiagnostic testing. Determination of an underlying neurologic cause for deformity can be increased by over 30% through the incorporation of genetic testing and other components of the ADA.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> When used in lieu of or in addition to traditional diagnostic tools for neuropathology, the addition of genetic testing and, as needed, tissue biopsy or repeat EMG/NCV markedly increases the ability to detect or further specify a neurologic etiology for CVD.</p>

        <p>LOE-Therapeutic-Level III</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Clubfeet associated with a diagnosis of arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC) are more difficult to treat than idiopathic classifications. The amount of initial treatment, additional treatment, and relative success of casting protocols, however, are not well known, particularly with moderate to long-term follow-up.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A total of 624 consecutive patients undergoing Ponseti casting for clubfoot between 2000 and 2022 were retrospectively reviewed and grouped by diagnosis with inclusion criteria being treatment initiated within the first 6&#x2009;months of age, a diagnosis of arthrogryposis or an exclusionary diagnosis of idiopathic club foot (ICF), and a minimum of 5-year follow-up. Groups were propensity matched on gender, laterality, and age at initial cast. Casting data, recurrence incidence, posterior medial release (PMR) surgery, salvage procedures, and additional surgeries such as repeat TALs and other tenotomies were compared between groups. Differences reported here met statistical significance by Student t-test or Fisher&#x2019;s exact test unless otherwise indicated.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Twenty-three individuals with AMC and 185 with ICF met the inclusion criteria. All AMC subjects were bilateral. Propensity matching determined a subset of 23 ICF subjects for statistical comparison. No differences in time or casts applied were found in initial casting treatment. Children with AMC were 30% more likely to have at least one recurrence (87% versus 50%, odds ratio&#x2009;=&#x2009;5.0), recurred at a younger age (1.4 versus 3.0&#x2009;years), and required more casts for the first recurrence (4.0 versus 2.3). Ten AMC children (43%) went on to PMR surgery compared to one ICF (4%), an odds ratio of 17. Five AMC individuals further went on to a salvage procedure, primarily talectomy. Rates of additional surgeries were not different between groups (61% AMC versus 48% ICF).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Some important differences reflecting the challenges of treating club foot in the arthrogryposis population were determined in this study. Most significantly, children with AMC were 5 times more likely to have recurrence and 17 times more likely to require PMR. Still, more than half of the AMC group were successfully treated without PMR or salvage operations and did not require more frequent additional surgeries to augment casting.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Understanding the treatment course and outcomes of Ponseti treatment for clubfoot can help inform the expectations of both the provider and the patient and family. We compare these findings in children with arthrogryposis to the more commonly managed idiopathic clubfoot group to add perspective for this population.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Juvenile hallux valgus (JHV) is a forefoot deformity of the skeletally immature population with an increase in the hallux valgus and intermetatarsal angle, impacting the quality of adult life. Correction of angular deformities by epiphysiodesis was first described by Blount and become popular with &#x201C;guided growth surgery.&#x201D; Our objective study was to analyze the effect of guided growth of the first metatarsal in the correction of these parameters at the end of growth.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> We retrospectively reviewed 64 feet with JHV with a severe family history, submitted to proximal lateral epiphysiodesis of the first metatarsal (2012&#x2013;2022). Radiological measurements were performed on weight-bearing X-rays. Seven parameters were measured. The American-Orthopedic-Foot-and-Ankle-Society-Hallux-Scale (AOFAS) was applied pre/post-operatively. All patients were operated by the same technique (percutaneous drilling/curettage of the lateral quart of the proximal growth plate of the first metatarsal). One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), Mann&#x2013;Whitney U test, and chi-square test were used in statistical analysis.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> The mean follow-up was 2.6&#x2009;years. There were no major complications. HVA improved in 48/64 feet (75%). The average HVA change was 4.2&#xB0; (SD&#x2009;=&#x2009;4.3&#xB0;). IMA improved in 50/64 feet (78%). The average IMA change was 1.6&#xB0; (SD&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.9&#xB0;). Both IMA and HVA improved in 47/64 feet (73.4%). Correction to reference values for HVA occurred in 38/64 feet (60%) and for IMA occurred in 37 feet (58%). These patients had a lower pre-operative HVA (20.8&#xB0; versus 25.3&#xB0;), IMA (11.0&#xB0; versus 14.0&#xB0;), PMAA (2.0&#xB0; versus 3.1&#xB0;), and DMAA (3.7&#xB0; versus 9.1&#xB0;). The AOFAS improved in 62/64 feet (97%). The average change in AOFAS was 23.6 (SD&#x2009;=&#x2009;10.09). The average PMAA change was 1.4 valgus (SD&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.6). There was no considerable effect in DMAA. No evidence of bone growth arrest was documented.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Hemiepiphysiodesis is a valid management option, with an overall good outcome in 60% of patients. However, if we consider the mild/moderate cases, this number rises to 84%, being effective in halting disease progression and improvement in patient&#x2019;s symptoms and aesthetic concerns.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Few studies reported on the results of hemiepiphysiodesis in correction of JHV, however with mixed results. This is the first study that tries to identify predictive X-ray parameters for good results.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Premature physeal closure is frequently encountered in the management of pediatric distal tibia physeal fractures. An accurate bone age assessment is invaluable in optimizing decision making with respect to prognosis and treatment. The purpose of the current study was twofold: (1) to create and validate an ankle bone age (BA) atlas spanning the pediatric and adolescent years and (2) to utilize this atlas in conjunction with distal tibia/fibular growth data as measured on serial radiographs to develop a predictive growth model for the lower extremity.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Radiographs were surveyed to identify distinguishable and reproducible features of the tibia, fibula, hindfoot, and midfoot. In a similar manner to the creation of the Greulich and Pyle atlas, a &#x201C;standard&#x201D; for each age/sex was selected to create an ankle BA atlas. A separate cohort of 90 patients was selected to validate the atlas. A sub-cohort of 41 patients with left-hand radiographs within 3&#x2009;months of ankle imaging was used to compare the two BA approaches. Furthermore, Harris growth lines were evaluated using 304 serial images of the distal tibia to determine remaining growth.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> The distal tibia/fibula ossification centers provided the best age assessment for early childhood (male age: 1&#x2013;6&#x2009;years; female age: 1&#x2013;5&#x2009;years). The ossification/fusion of the calcaneal apophysis provided the best age assessment in the preadolescent stage (male age: 6&#x2013;14&#x2009;years; female age: 5&#x2013;12&#x2009;years). The closure of the distal tibia/fibula physes best determined skeletal maturity (male age: 14&#x2013;16; female age: 12&#x2013;14&#x2009;years). The ankle atlas had excellent inter- and intra-observer reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC)&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.993, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001 and 0.998, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), respectively. We found excellent correlation between the patient&#x2019;s chronologic age and ankle BA (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.984; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Ankle BA assessment and G&amp;P were correlated (rs&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.822, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). We found that males with a BA of &#x2265;15&#x2009;years and females with a BA of &#x2265;13&#x2009;years had &#x2264;2&#x2009;mm of residual growth of the distal tibia/fibula physes (Table 1).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> BA can be determined using ankle films ordered to assess/treat ankle injuries. This tool, along with our growth remaining table, may have important clinical implications when managing ankle trauma patients with premature physeal closure.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This atlas can be utilized to help guide the surgeon as to the potential need and timing of surgical intervention after skeletal trauma associated with a premature physeal closure.</p>

</p>
        <p>LOE-Prognostic-Level III</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Hip surveillance in cerebral palsy (CP) is an accepted practice with consensus-based guidelines adopted worldwide. For the skeletally immature, with open triradiate cartilage (TRC), recommendations for radiographic surveillance stemmed from population-based studies. For non-ambulatory CP, progression of hip displacement (HD) after skeletal maturity has recently been reported, with risk factors including a migration percentage (MP) &gt;35% and pelvic obliquity at TRC closure. Less is known, however, for ambulatory CP. The objective was to determine the prevalence and risk factors associated with progressive HD after TRC closure, a proxy for skeletal maturity, for persons with ambulatory CP.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Retrospective cohort study. Patients with ambulatory CP (Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) I-III), hypertonic motor type, regular hip surveillance (3+ X-rays after age 10&#x2009;years, 1 prior to TRC closure, 1+ after age 16&#x2009;years), and 2-year follow-up post TRC closure were included. The primary outcome was MP. Secondary outcomes included previous preventive/reconstructive surgery, topographic pattern, gender, scoliosis (&gt;40&#xB0; or spinal fusion after TRC closure), epilepsy, ventriculoperitoneal shunt, and the presence of G-tube. An &#x201C;unsuccessful hip&#x201D; was defined by MP &#x2265;30%, MP progression by &#x2265;10%, and/or requiring reconstructive surgery after TRC closure. Statistical analyses included chi-square and multivariate Cox regression analyses. Kaplan&#x2013;Meier survivorship was also determined. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to identify the MP threshold for progression to an unsuccessful hip after TRC closure.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Seventy-six patients (39.5% female) met the inclusion criteria, with mean follow-up 4.7&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;2.1&#x2009;years after TRC closure. The age at TRC closure for females/males was 13.5(&#xB1;&#x2009;1.7)/14.2(&#xB1;&#x2009;1.7) years (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.12). Sixteen (21.1%) patients had an unsuccessful hip outcome at final follow-up. By chi-square analysis, diplegia (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002) and the presence of epilepsy (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.04) were risk factors for an unsuccessful hip. By multivariate analysis, only &#x201C;first MP at TRC closure&#x201D; (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) was a significant risk factor for progression to an unsuccessful hip. The mean survival time for progression to an unsuccessful hip was higher for females (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.02). A first MP at TRC closure of &#x2265;28% was associated with an unsuccessful hip at final follow-up (ROC analysis, area under the curve (AUC): 0.845, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.02).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The risk of MP progression after skeletal maturity was still relatively high (21%), similar to non-ambulatory CP. Annual hip surveillance X-rays after TRC closure should continue for GMFCS levels I&#x2013;III with an MP &#x2265;28% after TRC closure, especially for bilateral CP, males, and for those with epilepsy.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> The prevalence and risk factors for progressive HD after skeletal maturity can be used to inform hip surveillance programs for ambulatory CP.</p>

        <p>LOE-Diagnostic-Level I</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Hip surveillance programs for cerebral palsy (CP) recommend standardized radiographs to identify hip displacement because physical examination is believed to be an unreliable predictor of hip displacement. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether physical examination of hip range of motion can rule out or predict a clinically significant hip displacement (migration percentage&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;30%).</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> The CP Hip Outcomes Project (CHOP) is a long-term prospective cohort study of patients (2&#x2013;18 years old) enrolled from 28 sites in 10 countries evaluating the comparative effectiveness of different management strategies for hip displacement in non-ambulant children with CP (Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) IV and V). A total of 622 children enrolled prospectively in CHOP were evaluated at baseline for range of motion (ROM: R1 and R2) of hip abduction with hips and knees flexed; hip abduction with hips and knees extended; hip flexion contracture; and popliteal angles. ROM assessments were correlated with the respective MPs of each hip measured from the standardized AP radiograph of the pelvis, using linear regression, with analysis conducted for each side. Receiver operating curves were created for each specific ROM with area under the curve (AUC) reported to quantify the power of each test to predict MP &#x2265;30%.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Mean (range) age of the cohort was 6.9 (2&#x2013;18)&#x2009;years. Mean MP was 58% (0%&#x2013;100%) on each side. There was a non-linear relationship between hip abduction (R1 and R2) and MP. Ranges of motion&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;30&#xB0; had little correlation with the MP. When abduction was less than 25&#xB0;, there was a stronger negative correlation between ROM and increasing MP (see Figure). However, the predictive value of the ROM was poor with an AUC of only 54%&#x2013;59%, respectively, for R1 and R2 of hip abduction both with knees flexed or extended (see Figure). The knee popliteal angle fared worse with AUC of just over 50%.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This study confirms empirically in a large prospectively collected data set that the physical examination based on the ROM of the hip is a poor predictor of hip displacement, justifying the rationale of radiographs for hip surveillance programs in CP.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Evaluation of the range of motion during hip surveillance might still have clinical utility to inform indications for, and decision making about, specific interventions such as spasticity management or muscle contracture releases based on the type and magnitude of these contractures, but should not be used to predict hip displacement in CP.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Guided growth of the proximal femur (PFGG) is a treatment option for coxa valga deformity in children with cerebral palsy (CP). Understanding proximal femoral geometric features by functional level is important to provide a rationale for the use of guided growth as a potential intervention for hip displacement. This study evaluates the neck shaft angle (NSA) and the head shaft angle (HSA) in children with different levels of neurological disability.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Medical records and pelvic radiographs of children aged 1&#x2013;12 with a diagnosis of spastic CP, spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) I-II, or typical development from 2006 to 2021 were reviewed to evaluate the NSA and HSA. Patients were divided into five groups: Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) I-II, GMFCS III, GMFCS IV-V, SMA 1-2, and typical development. A linear mixed model (LMM) was utilized to evaluate NSA and HSA within the groups during the growth.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> In total, 196 consecutive children with multiple visits were included. The distribution and measurement of children were: GMFCS I&#x2013;II 8 children (33 hip evaluations, NSA 143.7&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;7.4, HSA 160.0&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;7.1), GMFCS III 22 children (130 hip evaluations, NSA 153.1&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;4.3, HSA 163.4&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;4.2), GMFCS IV&#x2013;V 30 children (137 hip evaluations, NSA 156.4&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;5.6, HSA 167.9&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;6.8), SMA 1&#x2013;2 32 children (83 hip evaluations, NSA 161.9&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;9.7, HSA 173.4&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;7.4), and typical development 104 children (222 hip evaluations, NSA 138.6&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;7.0, HSA 156.4&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;5.9). Mean age of all children was 4.8&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;4.5&#x2009;years (range: 0.4&#x2013;12.78&#x2009;years). Typical development group had NSA lower than SMA 1&#x2013;2, GMFCS III, and GMFCS IV&#x2013;V groups. GMFCS I&#x2013;II group had lower HSA than GMFCS IV&#x2013;V. Typical development group had NSA lower than SMA 1&#x2013;2, GMFCS III, and GMFCS IV&#x2013;V groups (Figure). GMFCS I&#x2013;II had lower NSA than GMFCS III and GMFCS IV&#x2013;V. LMM shows that there are significant statistical differences when comparing NSA and HSA among the groups.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> As children grow, NSA and HSA tend to decrease in typical development and GMFCS I&#x2013;II groups. However, in low-tone groups (SMA 1&#x2013;2) and high-tone groups (GMFCS IV&#x2013;V), NSA and HSA tend to increase with age. In both low-tone and high-tone groups, coxa valga is observed. Using PFGG may help change the course of HSA and NSA in both low- and high-tone groups.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> PFGG relies on anatomical parameters to correct the coxa valga deformity. Understanding NSA and HSA for different levels of neurological impairment may assist with diagnostic tools, aid in treatment planning, and help monitor the progress of interventions.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Proximal femur guided growth by an eccentric transphyseal screw has been used to treat spastic hip displacement in cerebral palsy children. However, there was no long-term follow-up outcome for this inventive treatment. The purpose of this study was to report postoperative long-term results.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> This case series study included consecutive patients who received soft-tissue release and guided growth at the proximal femur from 2005 to 2014 with more than 5-year follow-up. Surgical indications were children with spastic cerebral palsy aged 4&#x2013;12&#x2009;years, gross motor function classification system level III, IV, or V, and hip displacement noted on X-ray image. Parameters include Reimer&#x2019;s migration percentage (MP) which was compared between preoperative and postoperative 1&#x2009;year, 2&#x2009;years, 5&#x2009;years, and last follow-up pelvis X-ray image.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Sixteen children with 30 spastic hip displacements received guided growth surgery and soft tissue release in the study period. The mean operation age was 7.4&#x2009;years, and the mean follow-up duration was 9.4&#x2009;years. The mean pre-operative MP of the 30 hips was 46.5%. The mean MP in the post-operative 1, 2, 5&#x2009;years and last follow-up was 37.8%, 36.4%, 26.1%, and 26.6%. The changes of MP were statistically significant between preoperative and postoperative 5-year and last follow-up. After guided growth, only two patients received proximal femur varus osteotomy to treat residual spastic hip displacement.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Although not as acute and definite as varus osteotomy, the correction effect by the guided growth on proximal femur was encouraging in our study. Less surgical dissection and hospital stay, less complication, and faster recovery of motion make the guided growth surgery a treatment option for cerebral palsy children with spastic hip displacement.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This study reported the long-term follow-up results of guided growth in the capital femoral physis for spastic hip displacement in cerebral palsy children.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Children with cerebral palsy (CP) are at an increased risk of developing progressive neuromuscular hip subluxation and potential dislocation due to altered muscle forces across the hip joint. Progressive neuromuscular hip displacement can lead to altered spino-pelvic mechanics and eventual hip pain and arthritis, imposing challenges for both patients and caregivers. This current study aims to evaluate the potential additive protective role of proximal femoral epiphysiodesis (PFE) after varus derotation femoral osteotomy (VDRO) in preventing recurrent coxa valga in CP patients with progressive neuromuscular hip disease.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> We conducted a retrospective study of pediatric patients with CP who underwent a combined staged treatment approach involving VDRO at index surgery and PFE at the time of hardware removal at a tertiary pediatric orthopedic hospital between 2007 and 2022. We evaluated radiographic hip progression at four distinct time points: initial presentation, post-VDRO, post-PFE, and latest follow-up. Radiographic progression of the included hips was evaluated by measuring the acetabular index (AI), lateral center-edge angle (LCEA), neck-shaft angle (NSA), physeal tilt (PT), head-shaft angle (HAS), and migration percentage (MP) at all time points.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Twenty-one hips in 12 patients were included with a mean follow-up of 6.5&#x2009;years (2.1&#x2013;10.5,&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;2.5). The average age at VDRO was 6.2 (3.6&#x2013;12.7,&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;2.3) and PFE was 7.2 (4.2&#x2013;12.7,&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;2.0). Significant radiographic improvements in all measurements were observed following VDRO. Similar improvements were not observed after PFE at latest follow-up of 6.5&#x2009;years (2.1&#x2013;10.5,&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;2.5) (see Table 1).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our findings suggest that while VDRO is effective in improving radiographic measurements in CP patients with neuromuscular hip dysplasia, the addition of PFE does not provide further radiographic benefits at an average follow-up of 6.5&#x2009;years (2.1&#x2013;10.5,&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;2.5&#x2009;years). Large-scale prospective studies are needed to further delineate the role of PFE and help us refine our treatment strategies for this patient population and their families.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Previous studies have investigated the benefits of both procedures individually, but there is limited knowledge regarding the additive effects of PFE following VDRO. We sought to address this gap in the literature, and we found that while VDRO led to significantly improved radiological outcomes for every measurement, PFE yielded no additional significant improvements at latest follow-up. These results can help guide caregiver counseling and can aid providers in surgical planning.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Non-ambulatory children with cerebral palsy have a high prevalence of hip dislocation, which may cause pain, seating, and perineal hygiene difficulty, contributing to scoliosis and pelvic obliquity. Surgical treatment includes procedures like proximal femoral reorientation by varus de-rotational osteotomy (VDRO). However, recurrent hip instability can be as high as 77% between index surgery and skeletal maturity. We evaluated the association between femoral diaphyseal medialization at the VDRO site and the recurrence of hip displacement. We hypothesized that medialization modifies the resultant forces around the hip, reducing the femoral remodeling that leads to recurrent instability.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> We retrospectively evaluated the medical and radiographic records of 138 patients (276 hips) with cerebral palsy (CP), GMFCS IV or V, and followed until skeletal maturity (average 11.3&#x2009;years). All patients had been registered on the Statewide CP Register (SCPR) and managed by bilateral femoral VDRO as index surgery, between 1998 and 2012. Radiographic measurement of medialization was performed using the medialization index (MeI) described by Davids et al. (2013), preoperatively, at 6&#x2009;weeks, at 12&#x2009;months post-surgery, and at skeletal maturity. Failure or relapse of instability was defined as the need for revision surgery before skeletal maturity or final migration percentage (MP)&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;40%. The influence of MeI was determined by Poisson regression with multiple variances. Inter and intra-observer reliability of MeI was assessed by 4 different observers in 72 hip radiographs using Cohen&#x2019;s D test. Finally, medialization was bench tested in synthetic models to evaluate its stability, with system rigidity and deformation compared by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and logistic regression.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Groups with and without relapse were comparable pre-operatively regarding femoral morphological parameters and acetabular index. Baseline MP was higher in the relapse group (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). MeI at 6&#x2009;weeks post-surgery differed significantly between groups, being lower in the relapse group (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.004, risk ratio (RR)&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.07; confidence interval (CI)&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01&#x2013;0.42), considering confounding factors, including pre-operative MP. MeI showed good inter and intra-observer reliability with D inferior to 0.5 in all tests. Finally, the medialization of the diaphysis did not cause system failure clinically or instability in mechanical testing.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Patients with more femoral diaphysis medialization had reduced recurrence of hip instability in long-term follow-up. MeI proved to be radiographically reliable, and medialization did not increase mechanical instability.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Osteotomy medialization at VDRO site can be controlled by implant selection and surgical technique. This study suggests that medialization may reduce recurrence of hip instability in non-ambulatory CP patients, after VDRO.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Guided growth of proximal femur has been shown to be feasible to stabilize the hip subluxation in cerebral palsy (CP) children. However, in those with higher migration percentage (MP), guided growth alone might not suffice. This study addresses whether additional pelvic osteotomy can provide early hip stability and prevent further subluxation in CP children with serious hip displacement.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> We retrospectively studied data on CP children who underwent combined guided growth and pelvic osteotomy from 2016 to 2020 at a single institution. The indications for surgery were MP &gt;40% and head-shaft angle (HSA) &gt;155&#xB0; with acetabular dysplasia (acetabular index (AI)&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;22&#xB0;). There were 26 consecutive CP children (12 boys and 14 girls; 42 hips) who underwent index procedures with a minimum of 2-year follow-up. The mean age at surgery was 6.3&#x2009;years. Radiographic parameters including the HSA, AI, center-edge angle (CEA), Hilgenreiner&#x2019;s epiphyseal angle (HEA), and Reimer&#x2019;s MP were assessed before surgery and at 6&#x2009;months, 1&#x2009;year, 2&#x2009;years, and final visit after surgery.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> All radiographic measurements had statistical improvement in terms of the mean reduction of HSA by 9&#xB0;&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;8&#xB0; (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), the AI by 9&#xB0;&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;6&#xB0; (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), and the MP by 28% (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) at final visit. The HSA continued to steady decline after surgery, with lower HSA in patients with more follow-up times (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), older age at surgery (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.007), and milder GMFCS level (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). However, the AI and MP had an immediate reduction at 6-month follow-up and continue to slow decline until the latest visit. We also found that the 19 of 42 hips required a longer screw change due to physis grew off the screw tip. The four of 42 of hips who had a latest MP&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;50% were considered poor outcome. They were GMFCS IV and V and three hips had a severe baseline MP &#x2265;80%.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The combined guided growth and pelvic osteotomy provide hip stability with immediate improvement of AI and MP, while guided growth takes time to correct coxa valgus. It is an effective strategy in CP children with avoidance of multiple osteotomies.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> The study may be the first one to demonstrate the encouraging results of combined procedures in CP children with serious subluxation. Further study is necessary to determine the optimal timing of intervention and develop an algorithm for unstable CP hips.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Various salvage surgical procedures for painful hip dislocation in adolescent patients with cerebral palsy (CP) exist. In our institution, the McHale procedure is the standard of care for painful chronically dislocated hips with or without deformity of the femoral head in non-ambulatory patients with CP. This study focuses on mid-term results after surgical treatment.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Surgical reports and patient charts were analyzed retrospectively. All X-rays were evaluated and migration of the proximal femur and heterotopic ossification (HTO) according to Brooker were recorded. In addition, we conducted a telephone interview with the caretakers with special reference to pain pre- and postoperatively and after implant removal, sitting tolerance, range of motion, mobility, quality of life, and personal hygiene.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Fifty-two patients (65 hips) with a mean age of 13.5&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;3.6&#x2009;years (range: 4&#x2013;20&#x2009;years) were included. Mean surgery time was 178.4&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;63.4&#x2009;min (range: 45&#x2013;380&#x2009;min) and mean follow-up was 45.17&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;30.6&#x2009;months (range: 12&#x2013;204&#x2009;months). A significant difference between pre- and post-operative pain levels was found, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001. Personal hygiene (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02) and quality of life (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.013) improved significantly. Eighty-five percent of the caregivers would have the surgery performed on their child again and 81% of the caregivers would recommend the surgery to others. The removal of implants leads to a significant improvement in pain (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.011). A total of 22 complications in 65 McHale procedures (33.9 %) were related to the procedures.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> A significant reduction in pain and a significant improvement in hygiene as well as quality of life can be achieved with the McHale procedure in painful chronically dislocated hips in patients with cerebral palsy. Overall, the procedure is predominantly experienced as helpful by the caregivers and recommended to others. The removal of the implants improves pain significantly, but complications may occur in one third of the patients.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Medium-term follow-up data after McHale procedures are very encouraging. However, further studies to assess long-term outcomes after such procedures are needed.</p>

        <p>LOE-Not Applicable-Level II</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> The relationship between hip displacement (HD), pelvic obliquity (PO), and scoliosis in non-ambulatory children with cerebral palsy (CP) has not been clearly elucidated. The aims of this longitudinal, population-based study were to examine the prevalence and temporal sequence of these deformities and to evaluate how probable it is that severe unilateral HD could be the cause of scoliosis.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> The study comprised 106 non-ambulatory children (37 girls and 69 boys) with bilateral CP, born between 2002 and 2006, at Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) level IV or V, and enrolled in a surveillance program. Pelvic radiographs for measurements of migration percentage (MP) and PO were taken once a year from the diagnosis of HD. Spinal radiographs were taken in patients with clinical scoliosis. Only clinically significant deformities, defined as scoliosis with Cobb angle &#x2265;40&#xB0;, HD with MP &#x2265;40%, and supine position PO &#x2265;5&#xB0;, were included in the analyses.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Scoliosis occurred in 60 patients (57%) at a mean age of 11.8&#x2009;years (5.3&#x2013;16.3&#x2009;years). Sixty-five patients (61%) developed HD at a mean age of 4.8&#x2009;years (range, 0.7&#x2013;12.5&#x2009;years). Thirty-three children (31%) had PO in the supine position &#x2265;5&#xB0; at the latest follow-up; the mean PO was 10.4&#xB0; (5&#xB0;&#x2013;30&#xB0;). Nineteen patients had no deformities, 35 had 1 deformity, 33 had 2 deformities, and 19 patients had 3 deformities. The temporal sequence showed that HD was diagnosed before scoliosis in all except 2 of the 43 patients with both deformities. Thirteen of 17 patients (74%) with severe unilateral HD (MP&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;60%) had scoliosis convexity to the opposite side of the displaced hip.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The combination of clinically significant scoliosis and HD occurred in 41% of non-ambulatory children, and HD was diagnosed first in most of these patients. In children with severe, unilateral HD and PO, HD was probably a contributing cause of scoliosis.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> The surveillance of scoliosis in children with CP needs improvement to detect the deformity earlier. In children at GMFCS levels IV/V, a routine spine radiograph should be taken at an age of 5&#x2013;6&#x2009;years. If scoliosis occurs in young children, a spinal orthosis could be tried temporarily, providing improved sitting balance, head/neck control, and hand function until the child gets old enough for surgical correction.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Spasticity used to be considered as a contraindication for total hip replacement (THR). Due to the development of implants as well as surgical skills, THR became an option of treatment of painful dislocation of the hip joint in patients with spastic plegia. The aim of this study was an evaluation of mid-term results of THR in spastic cerebral palsy (CP) adolescent patients with painful hip with hip joint subluxation or dislocation.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> In 2014&#x2013;2022, 18 patients (19 hips) with CP between the ages of 16 and 20 years underwent THR in our department. The mean follow-up was 4&#x2009;years (range, 1&#x2013;9 years). Results were examined with Gross Motor Function Scale, VAS scale in accordance with Ashworth scale, types of implants used (dual mobility cup and not dual mobility cup), and radiological factors (Crowe scale). Complications were noted.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> In case of 10 patients, there was improvement in Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) scale average from 1 to 2 points after surgery. In all patients, improvement was observed in VAS scale average 8 points (from 10 to 7) According to Crowe scale, reposition of preoperative dislocation to primary acetabulum was achieved in all cases. Complications occurred in four cases: dislocation of two THR with dual mobility cup and two THR with non-dual mobility cup requiring revision surgery with good final result. No statistical significance was noted according to the type of cup (Mann&#x2013;Whitney U test).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Increased risk factors of complications are severe spasticity. We believe that CP patients with painful hip should be treated using THR. We did not observe any differences between the type of implant.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> These findings may serve as a basis for prediction of outcomes of THR treatment in this group of patients.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Children with cerebral palsy (CP) have high rates of foot deformity. Accurate assessment of these deformities is crucial for therapeutic planning and outcome evaluation. This study aims to evaluate the reliability of a novel photo-based Modified Foot Posture Index (MFPI) in the neuromuscular patient population.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> In this multicenter study, 12 orthopedic surgeons from 12 institutions evaluated standardized photographs of feet from 20 children with CP and scored their deformities using the MFPI. Raters scored photographs based on five parameters: for the hindfoot, curvature above and below the malleoli and calcaneal inversion/eversion were assessed and scored; for the forefoot, talonavicular congruence, medial arch height, and forefoot abduction/adduction were similarly evaluated and scored. Summary of MFPI scores range from &#x2212;10 to +10, where a positive number connotes a tendency toward planovalgus while a negative number connotes a tendency toward cavovarus. Inter-rater reliability was determined using a two-way mixed model of the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) set to absolute agreement.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> According to the MFPI, feet examined spanned the spectrum of potential pathology, including no deformity, mild, and moderate deformities. The inter-rater reliability for various components of the MFPI was evaluated, and the findings are summarized in Table 1. All scored variables showed high inter-rater reliability with ICC ranging from 0.965 to 0.984. Rear foot total score had a mean of 0.97, an ICC of 0.979, and a confidence interval (CI) of 0.968&#x2013;0.988 (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). The forefoot total score was 2.12 with an ICC of 0.984 and a CI of 0.976&#x2013;0.991 (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Finally, the overall total for the MFPI was mean 3.67 with an ICC of 0.982 and a CI of 0.972&#x2013;0.990 (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The photo-based MFPI demonstrates high inter-reliability in assessing foot deformities in children with CP, with specific high reliability in both rear foot and forefoot assessments. Its non-invasive nature and ease of use make it a promising tool for both clinical and research settings, especially in prospective studies evaluating the outcomes of foot reconstruction.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> In addition to radiographic and patient-reported outcomes, MFPI should be adopted as part of standard outcomes scores in studies regarding the treatment of CP-associated foot deformities.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Our objective was to evaluate the impact of external femoral derotation osteotomy (FDO) and equinus varus foot surgical correction (EVFSC) on transverse plane asymmetry in patients with spastic hemiplegic cerebral palsy (SHCP).</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Patients with SHCP, with two or more gait analyses and with pelvic asymmetry at baseline were included. A total of 453 participants were identified; however, those with mixed tone (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;45), other pathologies combined with hemiplegia (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;11), previous orthopedic surgeries (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;248), pre-operative gait analysis performed more than 2&#x2009;years before surgery (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;12), and those who underwent other surgical procedures (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;47) were excluded. The remaining 90 patients were divided into 4 groups according to the surgical procedure: Control Group (CG)&#x2014;no surgery (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;21); FDO (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;7); EVFSC (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;40); and FDO&#x2009;+&#x2009;EVFSC (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;22). Age at surgery, follow-up time, and baseline Gait Deviation Index (GDI) were compared. GDI, pelvic asymmetry (PA) in the transverse plane, internal hip rotation (IHR), and foot progression angle (FPA) in kinematics were analyzed at baseline and at the final follow-up, and the intra- and inter-group results were compared.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> The four groups matched in age at surgery (12.4&#x2013;16.7&#x2009;years) and follow-up time (34.5&#x2013;66&#x2009;months). At the final follow-up, a GDI reduction in the CG (3.6) and an increase in the other groups (7.7 in FDO, 10 in EVFSC and 21.8 in FDO&#x2009;+&#x2009;EVFSC) were observed. GDI improvement was greater in the FDO&#x2009;+&#x2009;EVFSC group than in the other groups (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). The reduction in PA in the transverse plane was higher in the FDO&#x2009;+&#x2009;EVFSC group (15.3&#xB0;) than in the EVFSC (5&#xB0;, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.007) and CG (1.2&#xB0;, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001) groups. Regarding IHR, we observed a decrease in the FDO&#x2009;+&#x2009;EVFSC (17&#xB0;), EVFSC (4.6&#xB0;), and FDO (3.1&#xB0;) groups, whereas the CG group exhibited a mild increase (1.1&#xB0;). The reduction in IHR in the FDO&#x2009;+&#x2009;EVFSC group was greater than that of the other groups (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Finally, the reduction in internal FPA was similar in the FDO&#x2009;+&#x2009;EVFSC (18.6&#xB0;, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002) and EVFSC (12.7&#xB0;, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.021) groups.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The combination of external FDO and EVFSC produced the greatest reduction in IHR and increase in GDI. Groups receiving EVFSC exhibited a greater reduction in internal FPA. Finally, the reduction in PA in the transverse plane was higher in the FDO&#x2009;+&#x2009;EVFSC groups than in the EVFSC or CG group, and it was similar to that of the FDO group.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Asymmetry in transverse plane is frequent in patients with SHCP and increased IHR and EVF deformity have been implicated as possible causes.</p>

</p>
        <p>LOE-Diagnostic-Level II</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Recent research in adults suggests that serum neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (S-NLR) is a superior diagnostic criterion for pyogenic septic arthritis (SA) compared to synovial fluid white blood cell count (SF-WBC) &gt;50,000 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> or &gt;90% polymorphonuclear leukocytes (%PMN). However, it is not known whether this finding extends to pediatric patients.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Medical records at a large urban tertiary care children&#x2019;s hospital were queried for emergency department visits between 2012 and 2022 where an aspiration was performed to evaluate for SA of the hip or knee. Patients &#x2265;18&#x2009;years old were excluded. Patients were considered &#x201C;positive&#x201D; for SA if synovial fluid analysis showed any of the following: (1) SF-WBC&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;50,000 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, (2)&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;90% PMNs, or (3) organisms reported on gram stain. This was termed the &#x201C;composite test.&#x201D; Cases where aspirate and/or operating room (OR) cultures revealed an offending organism were considered culture-positive septic arthritis (CPSA). Serum and synovial fluid test data were compared to assess their diagnostic utility. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves were examined to compare the predictive value of S-NLR compared with traditional indicators of SA.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> In total, 392 cases met the inclusion criteria (Figure 1A). Those with CPSA had higher ESR and CRP compared to culture negative patients (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01 and p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01, respectively). Univariate testing showed no difference in S-NLR between those with CPSA and those without CPSA (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.97). ROC analysis for the diagnosis of CPSA showed no difference between S-NLR and SF-WBC as diagnostics (area under the curve (AUC)&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.68 versus 0.63, respectively, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.42, Figure 1B). S-NLR was also not found to be a predictor of CPSA (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.90) in the 126 cases where the composite test was negative. Among patients with negative cultures, 38% had positive Lyme serologies.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In contrast to adults, S-NLR is not a good indicator of SA of the hip or knee in children. This may be because competing diagnoses in children (e.g. Lyme) come with systemic humoral inflammatory responses&#x2014;and increased S-NLR&#x2014;similar to that seen in pyogenic SA, while noninfectious/degenerative conditions that might represent the major alternate diagnosis in adults do not increase S-NLR significantly. Given regional variations in the incidence of Lyme disease, this topic should be further studied at centers outside Lyme-endemic areas.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Despite excitement regarding S-NLR as a diagnostic for adult SA, this criterion appears less useful in the diagnosis of pyogenic SA in pediatric patients.</p>

</p>
        <p>LOE-Prognostic-Level II</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Pediatric acute hematogenous osteomyelitis (PAHO) infections in New Zealand are often caused by methicillin-susceptible <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MSSA), and flucloxacillin is frequently used as a first-line treatment antibiotic. While most PAHO cases can be successfully treated with antibiotics, some patients respond poorly and/or require prolonged treatment despite their infecting bacteria having shown susceptibility in a laboratory setting. Other factors may contribute to antibiotic failure, such as the ability of <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> to form biofilms. Currently, there is a knowledge gap in how biofilm formation may be linked with antibiotic effectivity in PAHO. However, it is hypothesized that biofilms may influence antibiotic failure and poor clinical outcomes by shielding bacteria from antibiotics and giving bacteria the potential to become antibiotic-tolerant persister cells. Or is it due to increased virulence of the bacteria itself?</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> We sequenced 85 PAHO isolates from patients at Starship Hospital collected between 2008 and 2017 using short-read technology. Our institution is unique in that all bacteria causing PAHO over this period are stored in our &#x201C;bio bank.&#x201D; These bacteria were available for further analysis. The patient&#x2019;s clinical course was classified as complicated or uncomplicated. A. Complicated: pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission, Chronic or recurrent osteomyelitis, &gt;8&#x2009;weeks antibiotics. B. Uncomplicated: resolved with no major complication and maximum 1 operation, &lt;6.5&#x2009;weeks antibiotics. The microbiologists performing the bacterial analysis were blinded to the classification of the patient&#x2019;s clinical outcome. Genomes were sequenced using multiplexed SeqWell libraries run on two HiSeq lanes and assembled with SKESA.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Analysis to explore whether there are bacterial gene markers beyond antibiotic resistance that correlate with treatment failure found that increased carriage of LukS Panton/Valentine Leukocidin was associated with complications in treatment (84% complicated, 19% uncomplicated isolates). All nine PICU patients had increased LukS Panton/Valentine Leukocidin. In addition, there appears to be a correlation with a shift in the carriage of the type 8 capsule serotype-specific genes over the type 5 capsule serotype-specific genes (cap8HIJK versus cap5HIJK). Complicated 7% Type 5: 93% Type 8 Uncomplicated 38% Type 5: 62% Type 8.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> MSSA that causes complicated PAHO have a significantly increased carriage of LukS Panton/Valentine Leukocidin and a higher carriage of type 8 capsule serotype-specific genes when compared to MSSA bacteria in children with uncomplicated PAHO.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Osteomyelitis remains a significant issue among children in New Zealand. Identifying bacterial genes associated with poor outcomes in PAHO could help inform novel strategies for treatment in the future.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Pediatric musculoskeletal infections (MSKIs) are common invasive infections that account for, on average, 1 in every 10 consultations to a pediatric orthopedic provider at a tertiary care center. MSKIs may cause rapid decompensation and severe complications if not triaged and treated appropriately. Complications from these infections can be severe and often involve thromboembolic processes that lead to multiorgan dysfunction and death. The epidemiological landscape of causative pathogens has evolved over time, with <italic toggle="yes">Kingella kingae</italic> rising in incidence alongside the mainstays of <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Streptococcus pyogenes</italic>. However, many septic arthritis cases, regardless of pathogen, are managed similarly. We hypothesize that there are different characteristics in <italic toggle="yes">Kingella</italic> infections compared to <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">Streptococcus</italic> infections, with less severe presentations of <italic toggle="yes">Kingella</italic> MSKIs that warrant alternative treatment.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective review of patients at a single academic tertiary care center identified 712 pediatric MSKIs from January 2013 to July 2022. Each record was reviewed to collect patient and disease characteristics as well as blood and tissue culture data. Patients without a confirmed infection resulting from <italic toggle="yes">Kingella, Staphylococcus</italic>, or <italic toggle="yes">Streptococcus</italic> were excluded.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Patients with confirmed <italic toggle="yes">Kingella</italic> infection were significantly younger than those with confirmed <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">Streptococcus</italic> infection (1.23 versus 7.98 versus 6.77&#x2009;years, respectively, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001). <italic toggle="yes">Kingella</italic> had a non-statistically significant increased propensity for the lower extremity (95.2%) compared to <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus</italic> (85.7%) or <italic toggle="yes">Streptococcus</italic> (77.3%). Moreover, <italic toggle="yes">Kingella</italic> infections induced a significantly milder inflammatory response compared to <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">Streptococcus</italic>, with a lower admission C-reactive protein (mean, 41.3 versus 119.9 versus 100.0&#x2009;mg/L, respectively, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001) and higher admission platelet count (402.4 versus 304.0 versus 318.3, respectively, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.0036). 92.3% of patients with disseminated disease and complications had a diagnosed <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus</italic> infection, while 3.8% had <italic toggle="yes">Streptococcus</italic> and none had a <italic toggle="yes">Kingella</italic> infection. As such, unlike those with <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus</italic> infections, no patients with <italic toggle="yes">Kingella</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">Streptococcus</italic> infections required supplemental oxygen.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Cases of diagnosed <italic toggle="yes">Kingella</italic>-caused pediatric MSKIs differ from cases of <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">Streptococcus</italic> MSKIs. Patients with a MSKI resulting from <italic toggle="yes">Kingella</italic> are often younger and have a milder course of disease from MSKIs compared to patients with a <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">Streptococcus</italic> MSKI.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Understanding the epidemiological trends in MSKI is critical for developing appropriate treatment pathways for pediatric MSKI. Differences in <italic toggle="yes">Kingella</italic> infection severity compared to other pathogens may indicate a need to reevaluate contemporary approaches to their treatments. Use of molecular detection methods may allow for expedited diagnosis of <italic toggle="yes">Kingella</italic> infections, setting the stage for new focused treatment algorithms.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Pediatric acute septic arthritis necessitates urgent identification and treatment to avoid irreversible joint damage if not recognized and treated in a timely fashion. Many centers routinely send both aerobic and anaerobic cultures for the purpose of pathogen identification; however, the yield of anaerobic culture results has been called into question. The goal of this study was to determine the positivity rate of anaerobic cultures collected intraoperatively in pediatric patients with a clinical diagnosis of septic arthritis.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Patients with a clinical diagnosis of septic arthritis were extracted from a search of musculoskeletal infections at a large tertiary care pediatric hospital from 2007 to 2021. We examined cultures obtained from the emergency room or operating room through arthrocentesis or intraoperative culture. These cultures are routinely obtained in both aerobic and anaerobic culture media at our institution. We assessed the cultures and the clinical scenario surrounding them to assess the utility of anaerobic cultures in the diagnosis and management of pediatric septic arthritis.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> We identified 466 cases of pediatric septic arthritis of which only 3 cultures were positive (0.6%) for anaerobic organisms, two involving a hip and one involving a shoulder (Table 1). All cases involved a single isolate. The anaerobic bacteria that were detected included one facultative anaerobe, one strict anaerobe, and one relatively aerotolerant anaerobe (Table 1). Four aerobic organisms grew on the anaerobic cultures. These included methicillin-resistant <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (2) and <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus</italic> (2). These four false positives also grew on aerobic culture media. Neither the facultative anaerobe nor the aerotolerant anaerobe grew on aerobic culture media.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Over a 14-year period, only 0.6% (3 cases) of septic arthritis cases yielded positive anaerobic cultures that were not able to be cultured on aerobic media. As such, an anaerobic culture was more likely to culture a bacterium that would have also been also cultured on aerobic media. In addition, a true positive anaerobic culture that would not have been diagnosed on aerobic cultures only occurs about once every 5&#x2009;years at our institution.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> These results suggest that routinely obtaining anaerobic cultures may be of limited value in pediatric septic arthritis. In our sample, a positive culture of strict or facultative anaerobe was exceedingly unusual. The false-positive rate of anaerobic labs exceeds that of true-positive cases. These results provide actionable opportunity to help guide clinician decision making in a more cost-effective and efficient management of pediatric septic arthritis.</p>

</p>
        <p>LOE-Prognostic-Level III</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is a rare but potentially life-threatening infection that can occur in both pediatric and adult patients. Urgent identification and differentiation of NF from other soft tissue infections is vital to prevent associated morbidity and mortality. To date, few studies have examined the diagnosis and treatment of necrotizing fasciitis in pediatric populations. Thus, most of the diagnosis, prognosis, and management recommendations have been based on adult data. The goal of this study was to examine the variance in epidemiology and outcomes of pediatric and adult patients with confirmed NF.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective review from a single tertiary center identified 354 patients with confirmed NF, 23 children (&lt;17&#x2009;years of age) and 331 adults. Records were individually verified for the presence of disease prior to inclusion. Demographics including age, gender, infection origin, comorbidities, causative microbe, patient presenting symptoms, and mortality rate were compared.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Between children and adults with confirmed NF, similar rates of gender and ethnic distribution were observed. Upon admission, pain, erythema, and swelling were present at similar rates between cohorts. The origin and mechanism of infection were significantly different between cohorts with children experiencing extremity infections at double the rate of adults (73.9% versus 36.0%). Children presented with lower rates of NF from infected wounds (0.0% versus 25.8%) and higher rates of NF from puncture wounds (17.4% versus 8.1%) compared to adults. Tissue culture results were significantly different between cohorts with children developing culture-negative NF at more than five times the rate of adults (23.8% versus 4.6%, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01). Finally, children, along with having fewer comorbidities (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), had more favorable outcomes with shorter length of stay and lower rates of amputation and multi-organ failure. Importantly, children also had lower mortality rates compared to adults (4.3% versus 19.8%, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Cases of pediatric NF differ from those of adults with lower rates of comorbidities, different mechanisms of contracting NF, and higher rates of culture negativity. Future multi-center clinical studies are necessary to develop pediatric-specific (1) diagnostic criteria to allow us to detect NF and distinguish NF from other severe soft tissue infections, (2) prognostic algorithms to predict patient outcomes, and (3) clinical practice guidelines to direct optimal treatment.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> The unique features of pediatric NF, coupled with the rapidly progressive nature and potentially devastating sequelae, should prompt high clinical suspicion even when a child lacks traditional risk factors, disease features, and/or culture results commonly found in adults with NF.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Biopsy under general anesthetic (BGA) has been the standard of care in pediatric patients with suspected musculoskeletal malignancy. Scheduling and undertaking BGA may lead to delays in histological diagnosis and increase patient and parental anxiety. In our UK-based tertiary sarcoma center, we have increasingly performed awake percutaneous ultrasound-guided biopsies (AUPB) in children in cases of suspected musculoskeletal bone and soft tissue tumors. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety, feasibility, and cost-effectiveness of AUPB in children with suspected musculoskeletal tumors compared to conventional BGA.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective, institutional review board (IRB)-approved database review was undertaken on all consecutive pediatric biopsies (&lt;16&#x2009;years old) performed in a UK tertiary sarcoma center between March 2016 and March 2023. Data extracted included patient demographics, biopsy type, time to biopsy (TTB) (from decision being made), as well as duration of biopsy and associated complications. Procedure costings were also obtained. Comparison was made between patients undergoing AUPB versus BGA. The primary outcome measure was TTB. Secondary outcomes measures included diagnostic specimen rates, complications, and costs. Standard parametric and non-parametric statistical methods were undertaken (alpha&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05).</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Eighty-six patients were included in this study with 53 undergoing BGA versus 33 AUPB. AUPB was associated with a significant reduction in median TTB compared to BGA (3&#x2009;days (interquartile range (IQR), 2&#x2013;7) versus 5&#x2009;days (IQR, 2&#x2013;18&#x2009;days), p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.037). There was no significant difference in diagnostic specimen rate in AUPB compared to BGA (96% versus 97.5% p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.86) There were no complications in either group and no procedural abandonment in the AUPB group. Fifty-eight percent of patients undergoing AUPB had their biopsy on the same day as their initial assessment in clinic. AUPB conferred a reduction in financial cost of &#xA3;647 per patient (&#xA3;1177 versus &#xA3;1824, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). The mean age of patients undergoing AUPB was older than BGA (13.2&#x2009;years (range, 5&#x2013;16&#x2009;years) versus 8.5&#x2009;years (range, 3 months&#x2013;15&#x2009;years), p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Awake ultrasound-guided biopsy in suspected pediatric musculoskeletal tumors is an efficient, safe, well-tolerated, and cost-minimizing diagnostic tool. Its use reduces the time to obtain a histological diagnosis compared to biopsy under general anesthetic. While it may not be suitable for all children, this method is feasible and an important part of the diagnostic armamentarium.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Collaboration between clinicians and radiologists in identifying suitable patients for AUPB can facilitate efficient one-stop clinics, timely diagnosis, and reduce costs incurred in pediatric oncological services.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Osteosarcomas or Ewing&#x2019;s sarcomas represent 90% of malignant bone tumors in children. The improvement of oncological resections and oncological treatments pushes orthopedists to improve their limb reconstructions. Endoprostheses seems to provide a significant complication rate, around 60% of cumulative complication. In biologic intercalary reconstruction, four techniques are described: vascularized fibula (VF), allograft and vascularized fibula (AVF), allograft alone (A), or induced membrane (IM).</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> This is a multicenter retrospective study. It concerns 93 (mean age, 12.3) patients with resection of primary malignant diaphyseal tumors between June 1986 and December 2017 and were included in French or European-chemotherapy protocols. Healing index (HI), functional score, and complications were investigated. The number of interventions was counted and compared between the different techniques. The minimal follow-up is 5&#x2009;years.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> There were 53 osteosarcomas, 28 Ewing, and 12 other tumors, in 63 femurs and 30 tibias. Length of resection ranged from 18% to 88% of the bone length (mean 51%), with a mean length of resections was 19&#x2009;cm (&#xB1;&#x2009;5.2&#x2009;cm). Thirty-two patients had a VF, 13 had an AVF, 20 had an A, and 28 were treated with IM. Demographic data were comparable. Mean follow-up was 12 (5&#x2013;25)&#x2009;years. Per primam consolidation was obtained in 57% of patients. Nine patients (9.5%) required amputation, seven due to local recurrence, one due to infection, and one due to mechanical failure. HI were comparable, but the average number of interventions per patient was 1.7 for AVF, 3.3 for VF, 3.3 for A, and 2.9 for IM. Four allograft resorptions were reported. In VF, 10 patients had donor-site complications (15%).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> To our knowledge, no recent study offers a decision tree for choosing which technique for which resection. Functional results are good in all groups (MSTS mean: 85), comparison takes place on number of reoperations, complications, and time to consolidation. In femoral resections larger than 50% of bone length, AVFs provide good results. In tibias, VF and IM are comparable. However, IM leads to fewer reoperations and avoids donor-site complications. In IM non-unions, usually at proximal junction, fibula graft remained an option.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> The significance of this study is its comprehensive patient cohort and long-term follow-up data to help inform decision making for individual malignant tumors patients.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Osteosarcoma and Ewing&#x2019;s sarcoma are the most common primary malignant bone tumors of adolescents. Unlike in adult patients, where non-custom non-extendable modular implants are typically used, in pediatric patients often custom-made non-invasive extendable implants (CMNIEI) are used. The survivorship of CMNIEI is not well documented. Previous research suggests that revision rates ranged from 39% to 47%, including revisions due to marked leg length discrepancies, and that on average patients underwent 2.7 further operations at a mean follow-up of 29.4&#x2009;years. Complication and revision rates are important factors to consider in the management of these skeletally immature patients and this study seeks to add to that body of knowledge.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Retrospective case series between 2006 and 2023 of all skeletally immature patients with bone sarcoma treated by resection and reconstruction with CMNIEI by three surgeons within one nationally commissioned sarcoma unit. Patients with biological reconstructions were excluded. All prostheses were custom-made for each patient by Stanmore Implants Worldwide JTS&#xAE;. Data were collected on type of tumor, type and length of bone resection performed, implant design characteristics, cementation techniques, complication rate, and revision surgery rate.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Eighteen (9 male, 9 female) patients aged &#x2264;16&#x2009;years at the time of diagnosis were included in the study with minimum 2-year follow-up (mean&#x2009;=&#x2009;56&#x2009;months, range&#x2009;=&#x2009;12&#x2013;132). Fifteen had osteosarcoma and three had Ewing&#x2019;s sarcoma. Mean age at the time of diagnosis was 11.6&#x2009;years (range, 8&#x2013;15&#x2009;years). The mean resection length was 192&#x2009;mm (range, 150&#x2013;243&#x2009;mm, femur n&#x2009;=&#x2009;13, tibia n&#x2009;=&#x2009;5). 77.8% of CMNIEI implants survived at least 56&#x2009;months. Six of 18 patients (33.3%) suffered complications (fracture n&#x2009;=&#x2009;1, arthrofibrosis, scar revision n&#x2009;=&#x2009;3, other n&#x2009;=&#x2009;1) and 4/18 (22.2%) required implant revision (revision of growing component n&#x2009;=&#x2009;2, aseptic loosening n&#x2009;=&#x2009;2). There were no cases of deep infection. Of those who needed implant revision, the mean implant survival was 50.1&#x2009;months (range, 4.9&#x2013;135.0&#x2009;months), with the best implant survival in fully cemented implants. Six of 18 patients died of metastatic disease at a mean of 31.7&#x2009;months after presentation.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> 77.8% of implants survive at least 56&#x2009;months. Although the rate of complications is high (33.3%), only four implants were revised (22.2%), at a mean of 50.1&#x2009;months (range, 4.9&#x2013;135.0&#x2009;months). The lack of deep infections in our series (as opposed to the published rate of 6%&#x2013;18%) likely contributed to better implant survivorship.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This information helps guide pre-operative discussions with patients/families. There is a high incidence of complications (33.3%) but overall low revision rate (22.2%).</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Since survivors of childhood sarcoma may reach their elder years, the durability of limb reconstruction is important. Several methods for intercalary femoral and tibial defect reconstruction have been used. Allografts and endoprostheses are associated with a fairly high incidence of major revision and lifelong activity restrictions. Bone transport is a resurgent method of achieving living bone reconstruction that involves several additional procedures. Emerging evidence suggests that &#x201C;single barrel&#x201D; vascularized fibular free flaps (VFFF) are an alternative option for limb salvage. However, this approach remains uncommon because of uncertainty in the field about the complication profile, donor-site morbidity, and whether that reconstruction is mechanically sufficient for massive defects. Our main objective is to evaluate sufficiency and complications of intercalary reconstructions with a single-barrel VFFF with and without allograft.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Retrospective cohort study of 34 pediatric patients who underwent intercalary reconstruction for primary bone sarcoma of the lower extremity from 2005 to 2021 with minimum 2-year follow-up in one institution. To compare isolated vascularized fibular grafts to allograft or composite grafts (Capanna), we used descriptive and inferential statistical analyses using SPSS and classified complications according to the Clavien&#x2013;Dindo System.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Group No. 1 underwent reconstructions with allograft alone or combined with VFFF (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;13) while Group No. 2 underwent reconstructions with a single-barrel VFFF alone (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;21). No significant differences were found in gender, age (10.5&#x2009;years versus 11.4&#x2009;years), or diagnosis (osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma). Both groups had similar reconstruction length (21&#x2009;cm), incidence of unplanned surgeries (4.2 versus 2.4) for complications (soft tissue, infection, fracture, hardware failure) except for nonunion which was significantly lower in Group No. 2 (19%) compared to Group No. 1 (38%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.025). Most complications in both groups required surgical intervention. All patients resumed full weight-bearing. Donor-site morbidity was not a substantive source of complications.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> A single-barrel VFFF is not inferior and has at least one short/medium-term advantage regarding union compared to intercalary reconstruction using allograft or composite graft. Both groups had statistically similar rates of complications and unplanned surgeries. Full weight-bearing is readily achievable with a single-barrel VFFF even after massive reconstructions.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Since a VFFF restores living bone, the approach may allow for greater activity level, resistance to infection, and healing potential over several decades. Moreover, in regions worldwide where allografts are not available, intercalary reconstruction with VFFF is a feasible option.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Chondroblastoma of the femoral head epiphysis (CBFHE) is not an uncommon occurrence in children. Due to the vulnerability of the femoral head to necrosis and the potential for secondary deformity induced by the lesion, treatment poses a significant challenge. To address this concern, we sought to evaluate the impact of a simple and efficient method&#x2014;the femoral head cartilage window approach combined with artificial bone implantation&#x2014;on the growth of the femoral head.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Twenty-five cases of CBFHE were reviewed in our hospital. All patients were treated by the same surgical technique: anterior exposure of the femoral head was achieved using the Bikini approach. A cartilage window was opened in the weakest area of the lesion, which measured approximately 1.5&#x2009;cm&#x2009;&#xD7;&#x2009;1&#x2009;cm. The lesion was then curetted, followed by the implantation of artificial bone. The average age was 10.5&#x2009;years (range: 6&#x2013;14&#x2009;years); 14 cases were male and 11 were female. Preoperative symptom duration was on average 6&#x2009;months (range: 1&#x2013;24&#x2009;months). The Lodwick classification was used, showing two cases of class IA, 14 cases of class IB, and 9 cases of class IC. Nine cases presented invasion of the epiphyseal plate.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Follow-up postoperative evaluation was conducted at 37&#x2009;months (range: 22&#x2013;84&#x2009;months) and revealed no evidence of avascular necrosis or lesion recurrence. Femoral head deformity was observed in three cases, and two cases exhibited leg length discrepancies with shortening of 1.6 and 2&#x2009;cm, respectively. Preoperative MSTS scores averaged at 21.5 (range: 16&#x2013;24) and it improved to 28.7 (27&#x2013;30) postoperatively (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The combined approach of the femoral head cartilage window and artificial bone implantation represents a safe and effective method for treating CBFHE in children.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> The combined approach of the femoral head cartilage window and artificial bone implantation could be an option for CBFHE in children.</p>

        <p>LOE-Economic-Not Applicable</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Desmoid tumors are locally invasive soft tissue lesions that frequently occur in the pediatric population. There have been substantial advances in diagnosis, natural history, and treatments in the past 5&#x2009;years that have altered management. An international team used a formal process to develop evidence-based treatment recommendation for desmoid tumors with a sub-focus on the pediatric population.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Eighty-nine clinicians or researchers with expertise in desmoid tumors and leaders of patient advocacy groups were invited to participate. Data from a prior consensus paper was used as a baseline. New articles were assessed in several subtopics, and a meta-analysis was undertaken when appropriate data were available. A modified Delphi process was used with over 60 experts actively participating to develop recommendations.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> The diagnosis can be reliably by needle biopsy. Mutational analysis of the CTNNB1 gene, which encodes beta-catenin, should be undertaken to confirm the diagnosis. In mutation-negative cases, consideration should be given to genetic counseling or germ line APC mutational analysis, as these patients may have a form of familial adenomatous polyposis and routine colonoscopy is needed for surveillance. Almost a quarter of tumors will regress over time, and as such, active surveillance should be the first line of therapy unless a tumor is causing significant morbidity or has the potential for mortality. Surgery should be avoided, even in the smallest tumors, as recurrence rates are quite high, and overall outcome, as shown in meta-analysis, is worse than without surgery. In case of progressive or life-threatening situations, first-line therapy should be a methotrexate-vinblastine regimen. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors can be considered in the case of progression under this treatment. Studies on gamma secretase inhibitors in children are ongoing; however, this is associated with ovarian dysfunction, and should this be used with caution in girls. Radiation therapy should be avoided in children due to long-term side effects. The role of local therapy with other modalities, such as cryotherapy, is not well defined but could be discussed in small progressive lesion and/or refractory disease after several lines of therapy.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> A Delphi process resulted in treatment recommendations for pediatric patients with desmoid tumors.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> There was consensus around a shift away from surgery and toward active surveillance as a first-line treatment for pediatric desmoid tumors.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Avascular necrosis (AVN) is a serious complication of high-dose corticosteroid therapy for pediatric patients with leukemia/lymphoma. AVN primarily affects weight-bearing joints and long bones and may lead to significant osteoarthritis and early joint replacement. Early identification and intervention for AVN may prevent progressive joint collapse. The purpose of this study is to evaluate and characterize the occurrence and location of AVN using the newly developed Bone Location for AVN from STeroids (BLAST) classification system that considers specific bone locations and its impact on future joint collapse.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> An imaging database was queried for patients 25&#x2009;years of age and younger with a diagnosis of AVN and leukemia/lymphoma who required corticosteroid treatment. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the patients were reviewed and AVN sites classified using the BLAST system. AVN locations were described using descriptive statistics. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to assess odds of AVN bilaterality based on location.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 84 patients (49/35 males/females) with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-cell 74%, T-cell 21%) or acute myeloid leukemia (5%) were included in this cohort. The median age was 14.8&#x2009;years at leukemia diagnosis and 16.5&#x2009;years at AVN diagnosis. The majority of AVN locations include femur (87%), tibia (68%), and humerus (25%). Based on the Stanford-BLAST classification system, the most common sites of AVN overall include the proximal tibial metaphysis (61%), distal femoral metaphysis (60%) and epiphysis (60%), and femoral head epiphysis (50%). The most common sites of AVN in the tibia, humerus, and femur are proximal tibial metaphysis (89%), humeral head epiphysis (86%), and distal femoral metaphysis and epiphysis (68%), respectively. Patients with AVN in their tibia and humerus are 7.22 times and 9.11 times more likely to develop AVN bilaterally (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002) than patients with AVN elsewhere. Epiphyseal location was considered high risk for subsequent joint collapse in all locations.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This retrospective analysis demonstrates that AVN in leukemia/lymphoma patients on corticosteroid therapy has a clear predilection for specific locations in long bones. Using the BLAST classification system, practitioners are better equipped to characterize the incidence and location of AVN, monitor high-risk locations for joint collapse, and track early outcomes of preventive treatment.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> A standardized classification system for AVN that identifies high-risk locations for joint collapse will facilitate timely intervention for joint preservation in this population. Development of screening protocols for early detection and prospective multi-center AVN study groups will be critical to improve functional outcomes for leukemia/lymphoma survivors.</p>

        <p>LOE-Therapeutic-Level IV</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Intramedullary rodding of lower extremity long bones in patients with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a widely accepted technique for fracture treatment and prevention. Previous smaller studies have shown that telescoping rods have longer survival times compared to static rods. However, there are concerns about telescopic rod performance with potential complications such as failure to lengthen, rod tip migration, and breakage requiring revision. The purpose of this study was to examine risk factors that affect rod survival length in a large cohort of patients with OI.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> This was a multi-center retrospective comparative study of patients with OI who underwent intramedullary nailing of the femur and/or tibia. Each bone included had 2-year minimum follow-up from initial implantation, no rod replacement surgeries outside of the primary hospital system, and had full survival history of each rod implanted available (followed until removal or replacement). Patient demographics, clinical data, and details of each procedure were obtained. Multivariate regression analysis was used to examine risk factors for rod survival.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> In total, 597 rod surgeries in 171 patients met the inclusion criteria. Average patient follow-up was 10.3 (range, 2.1&#x2013;18.3)&#x2009;years. There were 405 static rods and 190 telescoping rods. Overall, telescoping nails had longer survival times compared to solid rods (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01). Within each rod type, the number of previous rod surgeries had a significant effect on longevity for telescoping rods (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.04) but not for static nails (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.9), with increasing number of surgeries leading to a decrease in rod survival. The type of bone (tibia versus femur) was significant for static nails (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.04) but not for telescoping nails (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.13), with femur rods being a risk factor for decreasing survival. The surgeon, number of osteotomies, and the use of bisphosphonates did not have a significant effect on survival for either group. Figure 1 shows the average rod survival time versus number of previous rod surgeries per bone for telescoping and static nails.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> For telescoping rods, the higher the number of previous surgeries, the shorter the survival time of the rod. After three rod surgeries in a bone, average survival of a telescoping rod was no longer than a static rod. For static nails, tibia nails had a longer survival than femur nails.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Surgeons should be aware that although telescoping rods do have longer survival compared to static rods, these advantages may decrease with increasing number of rod surgeries in the same bone.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> The use of telescopic nails is a frequently used treatment method in the treatment of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). However, providing rotational stability in telescopic nail systems is not always possible. In this respect, we believe that a long plate used in addition to the telescopic nail may be an ideal solution for this problem. Submuscular plates not only provide rotational stability but also protect the integrity of the long bones by providing additional stability and decreasing the rate of metaphyseal fractures. Our aim is to analyze the results and characteristics of the patients diagnosed with OI and underwent deformity correction surgery of the lower extremities with submuscular plates and telescopic nails simultaneously.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> The study included 48 OI patients who were operated between 2019 and 2022. The deformities were in the femur, tibia, or both. In the surgical procedure, the deformity was corrected by one or two osteotomies. After that, a telescopic nail was inserted anterogradely, retrogradely, or retropatellarly. Afterward, a submuscular bridging plate was applied through the metaphyseal parts of the bone. At least six cortices were fixated at both ends of the plate. Patients were splinted for 1&#x2009;week postoperatively. Partial weight-bearing was provided at the postoperative third week with thermoplastic braces. At the end of the 6&#x2009;weeks, full weight was allowed. Complication and refracture rates were recorded after the surgery.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> In this retrospective study, patients with OI and long bone fractures of the lower extremities with a follow-up period of at least 12&#x2009;months were included. In total, 48 OI patients (mean age&#x2009;=&#x2009;8.7) and 73 bones were included in the study. The average follow-up time is 26&#x2009;months (12&#x2013;36&#x2009;months). In all patients, the bony union was achieved without pseudoarthrosis and infections. There was a significant decrease in the rates of nail bending and fracture in patients with submuscular plate. It was also found that the immobilization period was shortened due to additional stabilization and load bearing was started earlier.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Telescopic nailing is an optimal surgical method in the treatment of long bone fractures in patients of OI. To decrease the fracture rates and the need for revision surgery, submuscular plates may be added simultaneously during the surgery to provide rotational stability. Further research is needed to provide clear evidence for this hypothesis.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Based on the results, a long plate used in addition to the telescopic nail could be an ideal solution for providing rotational stability.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Intramedullary rodding of lower extremity long bones in patients with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a widely accepted technique for fracture treatment and prevention. Previous small studies with short- to medium-term follow-up have shown that telescoping rods have longer survival times compared to static rods. However, there are no long-term studies (10 or more years) evaluating the results of these procedures. The purpose of this study was to compare the rod survival duration and number of procedures in patients treated with static versus telescoping rods with 10-year minimum follow-up.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> This was a multi-center retrospective comparative study of patients with a diagnosis of OI who had intramedullary nailing of the femur and/or tibia. Each bone included in the study had 10-year minimum follow-up, only one type of rod utilized over the follow-up period, and no rod replacement surgeries outside the primary hospital system. Patient demographics, clinical data, and details of each procedure were obtained. Bones treated with static rods were compared to those treated with telescoping rods using independent-samples t-test for continuous variables and chi-square test for categorical variables.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> In total, 119 bones in 52 patients met the inclusion criteria. Average follow-up was 13.1 (range, 10.2&#x2013;18.4)&#x2009;years. Average age at implantation of first rod was 4.5&#x2009;years for static rods and 4.2&#x2009;years for telescopic rods. There were 69 femurs and 50 tibias. There were no differences between groups in follow-up length, Sillence type, bisphosphonate use, or age at first rod placement. There were significantly more tibias treated in the static rod group compared to the telescopic rod group. Average survival length was significantly longer for telescopic rods (Table 1). Bones treated with telescopic rods had significantly fewer surgeries compared to static rods (Table 1).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> At 10-year minimum follow-up, bone segments that received telescoping rods as the initial treatment required significantly fewer surgeries than those treated with static nails. The average survival time of telescopic rods was significantly higher.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Over the long term, bone segments in patients with OI treated with telescopic rods required fewer surgeries and had longer implant survival times compared to those treated with static rods. When available, surgeons should consider telescopic rods as the initial implant choice in this patient population.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Femoral fracture after femoral lengthening in patients with achondroplasia and hypochondroplasia is a frequent complication, occurring in up to 30%. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the effectiveness of prophylactic intramedullary rodding in preventing this complication.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Multicenter retrospective study involving 86 femoral lengthening procedures in 43 patients with achondroplasia or hypochondroplasia. Forty-two femora (21 patients) were prophylactically managed with intramedullary Rush rodding following external fixation removal (11 females and 10 males, mean age 14.53&#x2009;years) compared with 44 femora (22 patients) without prophylactic intramedullary rodding (13 females and 9 males, mean age 15.14&#x2009;years). The mean amount of lengthening in the rodding group was 13.3&#x2009;cm (52.6%), with an External Fixation Index of 25.79&#x2009;days/cm; inpatients without rodding was 14.32&#x2009;cm (61.5%) and 24.46&#x2009;days/cm, respectively.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Seven cases (15.9%) without rodding developed fracture. Four of them required surgical correction due to displacement or shortening. Only one patient (2.38%) had fracture of the femur after prophylactic rodding and surgery was not required. The incidence of femur fracture was significantly lower in the prophylactic rodding group compared to the non-rodding group (2.38% versus 15.9%, respectively; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.034). There were no cases of infection or avascular necrosis.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Prophylactic intramedullary rodding is a safe and effective method for preventing femoral fractures following femoral lengthening in patient with achondroplasia or hypochondroplasia.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Level III&#x2014;a retrospective comparative study. Mandatory treatment after femur lengthening when removing the external fixator.</p>

        <p>LOE-Therapeutic-Level IV</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Children with achondroplasia are prone to developing symptomatic spinal stenosis requiring surgery. Revision rates are thought to be high; however, the causes and rates of re-operation are unknown. The primary aim of this study was to investigate the causes that necessitate re-operation. In addition, we report on surgical techniques aimed at reducing the risks of these re-operations.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Retrospective review over an 8-year period of all patients with achondroplasia at a single institution. Demographics and surgical/revision details were recorded. Type of surgery was placed into four categories: decompression only, decompression with a short fusion (T10), decompression with a midlevel fusion (T7&#x2013;T9), and decompression with a long fusion (T2&#x2013;T4). The use of interbody cage was documented. Descriptive statistics and Fisher&#x2019;s exact test were performed.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 148 patients were identified, 33 underwent spinal surgery (22.2%) at a mean age of 17.6&#x2009;years. Twenty-one patients were included, 12 were excluded for follow-up. Sixteen revisions were performed on 9 patients (43%) and 4 required multiple revisions. Fourteen (67%) primary surgeries were done at our institution and 4 (29%) required revision. On average, the time from initial surgery to revision was 1.9&#x2009;years. Some revision surgeries were performed for multiple reasons: 8 pseudarthroses, 7 proximal junctional kyphosis (PJK), and 7 new neurologic findings. The mean follow-up from the index procedure was 5.8&#x2009;years. Short fusions were more likely to develop PJK with an odds ratio (OR) of 31.2 (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.007). Short fusions without a caudal interbody were also more likely to develop a caudal pseudarthrosis when compared with long and mid-fusions without a caudal interbody (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.044). To date, none of the initial long fusions with interbody have required revision.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This is the largest study of re-operative spinal deformity in patients with achondroplasia. The rate of surgery is 21.5% and the risk of revision is 32.1%. This is primarily due to pseudarthrosis, PJK, and recurrent neurologic symptoms. Surgeons should consider discussing spinal surgery as part of the patient&#x2019;s life plan and should consider wide decompression of the stenotic levels and fusion from T4 with the use of interbody cage at the caudal level in all patients to reduce risks of revision.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Children with achondroplasia have a high risk of developing symptomatic spinal stenosis requiring surgery. Revision rates of surgery are high and are most often due to pseudarthrosis and PJK. Longer fusions and use of an interbody cage can help mitigate these risks.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Cervical spine (CS) pathology is frequently encountered in pediatric skeletal dysplasias (SD). Collagen type 2 (COL2) patients are at risk for pathologic atlantoaxial instability (AAI). The value of associated clinical and imaging findings has yet to be compared. This study assesses these modalities and identifies significant values for surgical decision-making.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> An institutional review board (IRB)-approved retrospective case series via Epic query (2007&#x2013;2023) for SD with CS imaging. Inclusion criteria: COL2 diagnosis, pediatric orthopedist&#x2019;s history and examination, CS flexion and extension (F:E) radiographs, and CS F:E magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Patient demographics and clinical findings were collected. Radiographic measurements included dens diameter, anterior atlanto-dens interval (AADI), and posterior ADI (PADI). MRI measurements included cord diameter, space available for the cord (SAC), and myelomalacia. Surgical records were reviewed. Statistical analysis involved t-tests, significance p&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;0.05.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> In total, 547 SD patients with CS imaging included 78 COL2 patients. Fifty-one of 78 met all inclusion criteria. Patients included five COL2 diagnoses, most commonly spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia (64.7%, 33). Patients were majority 53.9% female (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;27) and 80.4% White (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;41). 17.6% underwent surgery (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;9). Clinically, &#x2265;1 AAI symptom was documented in 33.3% (3/9) of surgical and 19.0% (8/42) of nonsurgical patients (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.18). Physical examination revealed &#x2265;1 upper motor neuron sign(s) in 55.5% (5/9) of surgical and 23.8% (10/42) of nonsurgical patients (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.030). Surgical versus nonsurgical comparison found radiographic dens diameter as a percentage of C1 (51.3 versus 39.3%, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001), change in AADI F:E (6.46 versus 3.26&#x2009;mm, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.004), and change in PADI F:E (&#x2212;7.23 versus &#x2212;2.90&#x2009;mm, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001). MRI findings included SAC at neutral position (7.4 versus 9.2&#x2009;mm, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.016), change in SAC F:E in mm (1.9&#x2009;mm versus 0.6, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002) and relative to cord diameter (31.1% versus 8.2%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0008), and incidence of myelomalacia (77.8% versus 16.7%, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001). Surgical management included 77.8% (7) C1 decompression with immediate (6) or delayed (1) occipital-cervical fusion. Two patients (22.2%) underwent C1-2 fusion.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Clinical history did not provide a significant association, while the presence of a myelopathic examination did. Since both COL2 cohorts demonstrated AAI on imaging, the key value is identifying appropriate surgical thresholds. The most valuable measures include F:E PADI, change in MRI SAC F:E relative to cord diameter, and myelomalacia.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This study, the largest case series on COL2 conditions, shows the value of various clinical and radiology studies in the management of COL2 AAI, and it provides insight into the critical measurements that can aid surgical decision-making.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Spina bifida (SB) patients are more likely to suffer from hip dysplasia and developmental delays. At the Children&#x2019;s Hospital Zurich, a study to assess the prevalence of hip dysplasia in a group of SB patients with fetal closure of the spinal lesion was conducted and described this population&#x2019;s characteristics.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Hip ultrasound images of 144 children with SB following fetal SB repair surgery who underwent the examination during their first 6&#x2009;months of life were analyzed. The sonographic angle measurements were classified into hip maturity types according to the Graf method, divided into five types. Descriptive statistics were applied to summarize and present the data collected during the assessment of hip dysplasia prevalence in the group of SB patients following prenatal spinal closure.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> The prevalence hip dysplasia in this SB patient group was 3.8%, which was in the middle of the range reported in the general population (0.24%&#x2013;7.15%) and did not reach the expected percentages (30%&#x2013;50%) of previous SB studies. Eleven percent of immature hips were found, and in the subpopulation, 90% matured within 6&#x2009;months.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This study may prove that fetal SB repair also benefits hip development. However, future studies with larger patient groups and control sonographies are needed to provide more significant statements and determine the long-term outcomes of SB patients with hip dysplasia who have undergone fetal surgery.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> SB patients are more likely to suffer from hip dysplasia and developmental delays. Overall, these notable findings, that there may not be a significant difference in hip dysplasia rates between fetal-operated SB children and the general population, represent a significant contribution to the field, providing a solid foundation for further research on this topic. As this study is one of the first to examine the hip development of fetal-operated SB patients, the pleasing results further highlight the importance of studying hip development in children with SB and emphasize the need for continued investigation.</p>

        <p>LOE-Therapeutic-Level IV</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Congenital hip dislocation in arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC) occurs in 15%&#x2013;30% of patients. Although open reduction yields positive outcomes, concerns about potential iatrogenic hip stiffness persist. Our study compares pre- and postoperative hip ranges of motion (ROMs) and assesses ambulatory abilities in patients after open reduction. We hypothesize that the pre-existing motion limitations are minimally affected by relocation.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> From 2008 to 2018, 52 consecutive patients with AMC underwent 75 open reductions of congenitally dislocated hips (23 bilateral), most via a medial approach with femoral shortenings osteotomies as needed. All had &#x2265;2-year follow-up. Hip ROM was recorded preoperatively, post-operatively, and at last follow-up, as was ambulatory ability. Simultaneous and subsequent hip operations were recorded.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Average age at surgery was 23&#x2009;months (range, 10&#x2013;58&#x2009;months), with 68-month (24&#x2013;152&#x2009;months) follow-up. Thirty-four hips had flexion contractures &gt;20&#xB0; preoperatively (average 33&#xB0;), improving by 22&#xB0; at follow-up; 61 hips had &lt;45&#xB0; frog leg abduction (average 27&#xB0;), improving by 11&#xB0;; 41 hips had &lt;30&#xB0; abduction preoperatively (average 20&#xB0;) which improved by 11&#xB0;, all p-values&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001 (Table 1). Hips that had &lt;90&#xB0; of flexion pre-operatively showed no improvement or worsening at follow-up (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.867). Flexion-extension (Flx-Ext) total arc of motion (TAM) for all hips decreased by only 2&#xB0; from pre-operative to follow-up (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.507), and the internal-external rotational (IR-ER) TAM in extension decreased 13&#xB0; (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Pre-operatively, the 29 unilateral dislocated hips had an average TAM flx-ext of 7&#xB0; less than the contralateral hip (85&#xB0; versus 92&#xB0;); at final follow-up, that discrepancy only increased 3&#xB0; (78&#xB0; versus 88&#xB0;). All other TAMs were statistically unchanged at follow-up. Of the 52 patients, 30 were independently ambulatory at follow-up, most with braces, while 16 were walker-dependent but still progressing; six remained non-ambulatory.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Open reduction for arthrogrypotic hip dislocations maintains mobility without causing stiffness. While pre-existing hip motion limitations slightly worsened, lower limb positioning improved, enhancing ambulation&#x2014;especially in hip extension and abduction. Most achieved independent ambulation.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> The results of this study challenge the prevailing belief that performing an open reduction on arthrogrypotic hips leads to significant functional stiffness. Our findings suggest that open reduction can offer the patient a more functional hip, contrary to the perception of limited mobility. Children with AMC often have ambulatory potential if their limb positioning can be optimized.</p>

        <p>LOE-Therapeutic-Level III</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> X-linked hypophosphatemic (XLH) rickets is the commonest inherited form of rickets. Children often present with lower limb deformities. Corrective osteotomies in early childhood are associated with high recurrence rates and the risks of surgery. Burosumab is a monoclonal antibody approved in 2018 for the treatment of XLH. Administered fortnightly by subcutaneous injection, it is now the preferred medical treatment. We report the use of hemi-epiphysiodesis in a cohort of XLH patients pre and post the introduction of Burosumab.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> XLH patients referred to our orthopedic unit since 2005 were reviewed. Hemi-epiphysiodesis was undertaken if there was progressive mechanical axis deviation after 1&#x2009;year of maximized medical treatment. The rate of correction of deformity per month (RoC) was calculated from standardized long-leg radiographs using Traumacad software. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS. The Mann&#x2013;Whitney U test was used for analysis of continuous data. Statistical significance was set at p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Since 2005, 28 patients were seen for orthopedic assessment. Sixteen patients required 18 episodes of guided growth (32 limbs, 40 segments). Mean age was 10.2 (4.3&#x2013;14.7)&#x2009;years. Neutral mechanical axis was restored in 13/32 (41%) limbs: a further 7 (22%) improved. Mean follow-up was 42.7 (6&#x2013;116)&#x2009;months. Three patients (four limbs) underwent an osteotomy. The mean RoC with hemi-epiphysiodesis was 0.35&#xB0; for the distal femur and 0.20&#xB0; for the proximal tibia. Diaphyseal deformity RoC was 0.12&#xB0; per month in both the femur and the tibia. Younger patients (&#x2265;3&#x2009;years of growth remaining) corrected at the same rate as older patients. The RoC was higher for the distal femoral deformity and the femoral diaphyseal bow in females (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.043 and 0.047, respectively). Since 2018, 28 patients commenced Burosumab treatment, mean age 7.8 (0.5&#x2013;14.5)&#x2009;years. Mean follow-up was 31 (5&#x2013;53)&#x2009;months. The mean RoC per month with Burosumab was 0.21&#xB0; for the distal femur and 0.15&#xB0; for the proximal tibia, and 0.18&#xB0; for both femoral and tibial diaphyseal deformity. No statistical significance was found in RoC between hemi-epiphysiodesis and Burosomab treatment. No patient treated with Burosumab has required hemi-epiphysiodesis.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The data confirm that, in conjunction with medical therapy, hemi-epiphysiodesis is effective in correcting lower limb deformity. Burosumab alone demonstrates a similar improvement and no hemi-epiphysiodesis has yet been required.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This study suggests that Burosomab treatment of XLH improves lower limb deformity and reduces the need for hemi-epiphysiodesis.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> We aimed to assess the incidence and risk factors related to permanent brachial plexus birth injury (BPBI) in Southern Finland.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Helsinki University Hospital (HUS) New Children&#x2019;s Hospital is the primary and only care center for BPBI in Southern Finland, while HUS Women&#x2019;s Hospital oversees and trains all birth units in the region which hosts a population of 1.7 million. Birth information of all mothers and their children born 2006&#x2013;2022 were gathered from the national database and compared to prospectively gathered data from mothers and children with a permanent BPBI. Permanent injury was defined as limited active or passive ROM or decreased strength of the affected limb detected at 1&#x2009;year of age. Severity of the injury was assessed using the 3-month Toronto test score. In Finland, all women are subjected to the same prenatal care, and no private delivery hospitals exist.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 298,428 children were born within the study period. Six hundred acquired a BPBI, 100 of which were permanent. The incidence of permanent BPBI was 0.4 per 1000 vaginal live births (0.34 all births) with a declining trend. Children to immigrant mothers, and women of Black ethnicity had a higher incidence of a permanent injury (0.85 and 1.52). Non-White background and immigrant status correlated with a more severe injury (&#x3B2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;&#x2212;1.12 range, &#x2212;2.17 to &#x2212;0.07, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.004) with children of Black mothers having the least favorable outcome (&#x3B2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;&#x2212;1.64 range, &#x2212;2.79 to &#x2212;0.49, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.005). In the multivariate regression model, gestational diabetes in a Black mother further strengthened the negative effect (&#x3B2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;&#x2212;0.99, range, &#x2212;1.98 to &#x2212;0.00, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.049).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The overall incidence for a permanent BPBI is on a decline. However, care needs to be taken especially in non-White women to prevent and in a timely manner recognize and treat risk factors leading to severe birth complications.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Black ethnicity and immigrant status are risk factors for a permanent and more severe BPBI.</p>

        <p>LOE-Therapeutic-Level IV</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Sprengel deformity is a rare skeletal deformity due to a maldescent of the scapula. In addition to cosmetic issues, abduction limitation of the affected shoulder can be functionally impairing and thus the primary indication for surgical treatment. This study is designed to evaluate the function of the shoulder of patients who underwent surgery for deformity correction and those treated conservatively.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> The longitudinally maintained database of our orthopedic teaching hospital was retrospectively analyzed to identify all patients with Sprengel deformity who were treated from 2016 to 2022. Nineteen patients with a mean age of 6&#x2009;years (min./max. 0/16&#x2009;y), with 21 affected shoulders (right&#x2009;=&#x2009;10; left&#x2009;=&#x2009;7; bilateral&#x2009;=&#x2009;2) were included. Of these, 8/19 patients with a median Cavendish 4/Rigault 3 score and severe functional impairment were treated surgically according to a modified Green procedure and 11/19 patients (Cavendish 2/Rigault 2) were treated conservatively by means of physiotherapy. Shoulder function was assessed by clinical examination and the short version of Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand Questionnaire (quickDASH). Quality of life was evaluated using the EQ-5D-Y.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> In the surgical group, the Cavendish 4 could be reduced to Cavendish 1 (min./max. 1/3). Shoulder abduction improved by 45&#xB0; (interquartile range, 27.5) to a postoperative abduction of 135&#xB0; (median conservative cohort: 105&#xB0;). Five of those eight patients were satisfied with the outcome, one unsure and one unsatisfied. On average, patients needed 3&#x2009;months to be able to return to daily life activity. Nine of 19 questionnaires were complete. The median quickDASH score was 23 in the surgical cohort and 9 in the conservative cohort. Average follow-up was 66&#x2009;months (min./max. 4/145). The quality of life according to the EQ-5D-Y was 72/100 in the surgical cohort and 77/100 in the conservative group.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Although surgical intervention in Sprengel deformity implies intense surgery, it can improve the abduction of the affected shoulder and may reduce disability in daily life at a moderate level. Yet, mild forms can still have a sufficient function and should therefore not be considered for surgery. Quality of life seems to be almost equal in both groups. Thus, when advising about performing surgery on patients with Sprengel deformity, the quickDASH can help to evaluate the current limb function and lead together with the clinical evaluation to a better decision making.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Sprengel deformity is a rare congenital disorder and surgical correction means high impact surgery. It is therefore important for clinicians to know the gain by surgery for better patient counseling.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Sprengel shoulder is a rare congenital deformity caused by failure in the descent of the scapula during early fetal growth. This condition leads to hypoplastic, elevated, and malrotated scapula. The present study described clinical and functional outcomes in pediatric patients treated with surgery for Sprengel shoulder.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> From June 2010 to April 2021, 32 scapulae in 31 pediatric patients were surgically treated at our institution. Cavendish classification for aesthetics and Rigault classification for radiological appearance were used to assess deformity. Abduction and elevation movements were quantified. The following patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) were administered: QuickDASH, Simple Shoulder Test (SST), the Shoulder Pain Index and Shoulder Disability Index (SPADI), and UCLA Shoulder Scale. Complications were evaluated according to the modified Clavien&#x2013;Dindo&#x2013;Sink classification. Clavicle osteotomy and omovertebral bone resection were also performed in some cases.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> With a mean follow-up of 6.4&#x2009;years (range, 1&#x2013;11.2&#x2009;years), 2/32 major complications were found. In 18/32 patients, a Cavendish value of 1 was found, 18/32 achieved a degree of abduction greater than 120&#xB0;, and 21/32 achieved a degree of elevation greater than 135&#xB0;. The scores indicate that a good functional and aesthetic result was achieved in most cases. Few studies have used validated scores, often after treatment with Woodward technique. Moreover, this case series represents the largest collection of SD patients treated surgically.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In our experience, the modified Green&#x2019;s technique proved to be a safe procedure with a low rate of complications and recurrences. Despite the prolonged follow-up, we believe that the functional results should be evaluated even after the full maturation of the musculoskeletal system to confirm the long-term efficacy of this treatment.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This case series confirmed the good results of the modified Green&#x2019;s procedure in one of the largest cohort of patients ever reported.</p>

        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Demographics, modified Wassel-Flatt classification, and surgical and post-operative data were abstracted from the electronic medical records of patients with preaxial polydactyly at a single children&#x2019;s hospital between 2011 and 2022. Patients were contacted to complete an aesthetic survey adapted from the Australian Hand Difference Register, Wong-Baker pain, and PROMIS Upper Extremity Function and Peer Relations modules. Data were analyzed via descriptive statistics and non-parametric tests.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 232 children with 248 cases of preaxial polydactyly (6.5% bilateral, 43.5% female) underwent surgical treatment at a mean age of 1.5&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1.4&#x2009;years, with a mean 1.3&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;2.0&#x2009;years of follow-up. Patients mostly presented with Wassel-Flatt type IV duplications (87 thumbs, 35.1%), and notably, an additional 31 (12.5%) were the hypoplastic subtype. The majority of cases (181/248, 73.0%) underwent resection with reconstruction at a mean age of 1.6&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1.5&#x2009;years, with reconstruction including elements of ligament reconstruction, corrective osteotomy (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;97, 53.4%), and/or tendon realignment. Early post-operative complications occurred in 23/248 (9.3%) patients. Long-term complications occurred in 87/249 cases (34.9%), significantly more likely in triphalangeal thumbs and in cases needing reconstructive surgery (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001, Table 1). Only nine patients underwent revision surgery, all requiring corrective osteotomy for coronal plane deformity (mean pre-revision IPJ angular deformity 29.7&#xB0; and mean MPJ angular deformity 20.0&#xB0;). Thirty-nine patients completed prospective questionnaires at an average age of 7.3&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;3.5&#x2009;years, with normal PROMIS UE and Peer Relations scores (mean 46.4&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;9.2 and 52.4&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;9.2, respectively). Nearly all (31/37) respondents reported negligible pain (0&#x2013;1). Regarding aesthetics, 27 patients (69.2%) reported they &#x201C;strongly agreed&#x201D; or &#x201C;agreed&#x201D; with the statement &#x201C;I am happy with how my hands look.&#x201D; Similarly, 35 respondents (89.7%) &#x201C;strongly agreed&#x201D; or &#x201C;agreed&#x201D; that their operation(s) made their hands look better.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The revision surgery rate was 3.6%, reflecting technical emphasis on corrective osteotomy, ligament reconstruction, and/or tendon realignment at index surgery. In fact, more than half of the cases were treated with osteotomy at the time of the initial procedure. Normal post-operative function and excellent cosmesis can be expected.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Our series demonstrated a lower rate of revision surgery than previously reported in children with preaxial polydactyly, indicating the importance of corrective osteotomy at index surgery.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Pediatric ganglia are an understudied phenomenon, with an estimated 10% of all ganglia occurring in pediatric patients. Data on treatment modalities, recurrence rates, and cost effectiveness remains sparse. This study aims to characterize recurrence rates of surgical versus conservative management of pediatric ganglia, along with cost-effectiveness analysis of treatment modalities.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> This was a retrospective cohort study that included all patients from 1 December 2011 to 15 March 2023 that were treated at a single institution for primary or recurrent ganglia of the wrist. Patient data was gathered regarding ICD-10 code, CPT code, date of procedure, primary payer, and total cost of procedure associated. These data were then stratified into two cohorts: surgery and percutaneous ultrasound-guided fenestration of ganglia (PUGG). Patient data was analyzed for rates of recurrence, treatment methods for recurrence, and total costs of treatment.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Five hundred and ninety-five patients comprised our cohort, with a total of 710 procedures performed&#x2014;296 underwent PUGG and 414 underwent surgery. We noted a recurrence rate of 14.7% after PUGG and 21.2% after surgery. Mean time to recurrence was 302.66&#x2009;days after the PUGG cohort and 1619.13&#x2009;days after surgery (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001). PUGG recurrence was treated with surgery in 76.3% of cases and surgery recurrence was treated with re-operation in 59.2% of cases. Average payer charge was $2224.01 for PUGG and $11,645.71 for surgery (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001). Significant differences were seen in charges among private insurers (BCBS, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001) and Medicaid/CHIP (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0004). No significant differences were seen in cost of re-operation and repeat procedure for both surgery and PUGG groups, respectively, even after controlling for insurer status.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Ganglia are a challenging entity to definitively treat. PUGG can present as an alternative option for pediatric ganglia given its cost-effectiveness and comparable recurrence rates. One factor for practitioners to note is the faster time to recurrence for PUGG-treated ganglia. Both cohorts saw a preference for recurrence treatment with surgical management. Overall, PUGG can serve as an effective management strategy for pediatric ganglia.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This study is one of a few to examine pediatric ganglia recurrence rates after surgery and PUGG along with associated costs. This study shows that PUGG can effectively manage pediatric ganglia, with lower associated charges and recurrence rates.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Cerebral palsy (CP) in upper limb produces functional, aesthetic, and hygienic issues and is not always amenable to surgical procedures. We are reporting a single-center, long follow-up experience with tendon transfer in wrist and forearm CP.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> The CP cases who had undergone tendon transfer in hand, wrist, and forearm in a 14-year period were evaluated for change in motion, function, and cosmetic appearance and also assessed by MACS (Manual Ability Classification System) and DASH (Disability of Arm, Shoulder, Hand) scores.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Forty-two spastic CP patients with a mean age of 19.81 (10&#x2013;34&#x2009;years, SD: 5.36)&#x2009;years, with a mean follow-up of 5.5 (2&#x2013;14)&#x2009;years, entered the study. Twenty-four cases were Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) I or II and 18 were III or IV. Supination beyond neutral was seen in 48.5%, and improvement in MACS scores in all the cases. Improved &#x201C;grasp&#x201D; and &#x201C;release&#x201D; and keyboard use was seen in 50%, 71%, and 87% respectively. The satisfaction from appearance and improved function of 83%&#x2013;96% correlated positively with GMFCS, MACS, and DASH scores. Noticeable improvement in personal hygienic care was seen in only 52% of cases.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Tendon transfer in well-selected spastic upper extremity CP cases results in long-time improved function and limb appearance&#x2014;correlating with initial GMFCS and MACS scores.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> A long-term results of function improvement in pure spastic CP upper limb.</p>

</p>
        <p>LOE-Therapeutic-Level IV</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Various operative and post-operative protocols exist for the management of displaced supracondylar humeral fractures with most providing excellent functional outcomes by 1&#x2009;year. However, factors influencing the early return of elbow motion have not been evaluated. This study aims to identify factors influencing the time to return of elbow motion following operative fixation of displaced supracondylar humeral fractures.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> An institutional review board (IRB)-approved retrospective study was conducted of patients &lt;18&#x2009;years old treated at a tertiary children&#x2019;s hospital from January 2013 to January 2020 for a displaced supracondylar humerus fracture (Gartland type III/IV). Time to functional elbow motion was recorded for each patient and defined as elbow extension &lt;30&#x2009;degrees and flexion &gt;130&#x2009;degrees. Patients with screw fixation, inadequate documentation, insufficient follow-up, and incomplete recovery &lt;1&#x2009;year were excluded. Demographic data, injury characteristics, operative technique, and post-operative factors were recorded. Analysis was performed using Kruskal&#x2013;Wallis/Mann&#x2013;Whitney U tests after ensuring normality using the Shapiro&#x2013;Wilk test.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 433 displaced supracondylar humeral fractures were identified with an average age of 6.2&#x2009;years. Patient characteristics are outlined in Table 1. Median time to recovery of elbow motion was 40&#x2009;days. Flexion injuries (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;17/433, 3.9%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.012), fractures associated with nerve injuries (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;86/433, 19.9%, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), fractures undergoing open reduction (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;26/433, 6%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.012), and those fixed using &gt;3 pins (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;63/433, 14.5%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.018) took twice as long to regain motion. Referral to physical therapy was not beneficial for return of motion (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Immobilization &gt;21&#x2009;days following pin removal (&lt;0.001) delayed the return of motion by ~4&#x2009;weeks. Age, gender, additional ipsilateral fracture, days to pin removal, pin construct, and management of additional ipsilateral fracture (Op versus non-Op) did not delay the return of elbow motion (p&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.05).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> To our knowledge, this is the first study to describe factors influencing the return of elbow motion. Delay in return of motion is seen with flexion-type injuries, concomitant nerve injuries, fractures requiring open reduction, and &gt;3 pins. Splinting more than 3&#x2009;weeks following pin removal also delays recovery.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> At-risk populations for delay in return to elbow function include flexion-type injuries or nerve injuries and those requiring open reduction or more than 3 pins for fixation. Once pins are removed, immobilization in a splint for more than three additional weeks, even if motion is permitted when the splint is removed, can delay recovery as well.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Classification schemes of forearm deformity in multiple hereditary exostosis (MHE) were developed to guide surgical care in retrospective case series and have been shown to have low reliability in a prospective population. The purpose of this study is to develop a widely applicable classification system using the Delphi consensus technique.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Fifteen experienced pediatric orthopedic hand surgeons from the Congenital Upper Limb Registry (CoULD) Study Group undertook seven rounds of online surveys to establish consensus. Investigators (CV, MC) analyzed results and provided structured feedback between rounds, without direct contact with experts. A research associate administered expert surveys and anonymized results to investigators. Round 1 began with an open-ended questionnaire to identify the clinical features of forearm MHE experts believe may predict outcomes. Round 2 and beyond aimed to achieve consensus. Consensus agreement was defined as &#x2265;70% responses of either &#x201C;strongly agree&#x201D; or &#x201C;agree&#x201D; for a 7-point Likert-type or &#x201C;agree&#x201D; in a dichotomous question.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> In Round 1, a total of 10 patients and radiological characteristics were identified as themes for inclusion: (1) age at diagnosis; (2) family history; (3) genetic diagnosis; (4) symptoms (pain, stiffness, activity limitations); (5) clinical exam findings (visible deformity, wrist deviation, ROM limitation); (6) location of the osteochondroma; (7) number of osteochondroma; (8) bone alignment and shortening; (9) joint alignment; and (10) progression of the deformity. Round 2 consisted of a 7-point Likert-type scale. At this round, radial head dislocation, bone segment, ulnar shortening, radial alignment, distal radial inclination, distal radio ulnar joint (DRUJ), radial shortening, and ulnar variance were the items that reached the agreement threshold. In Round 3, experts were asked to choose between 3 or 4 categorical levels for the classification. Rounds 4 and 5 proposed a mild/moderate/severe classification and asked about the placement of each characteristic. In Round 6, experts asked to classify nine radiographs with the proposed classification and indicate whether this version fully classified the deformity. Closing criteria were met in the seventh and final round with 93% agreement. The proposed classification is presented in Table 1. Response rate was 100% in all rounds, with a range between 1 and 35&#x2009;days to responses.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The new CoULD MHE forearm classification developed by experts in the field of pediatric hand surgery incorporates three categories of forearm involvement: Type 3-Severe forearm involvement, Type 2-Moderate forearm involvement, and Type 1-Mild forearm involvement.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This work represents the first step in the validation process of a clinically applicable and inclusive classification for patients with forearm MHE.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Gymnast wrist is a niche injury experienced primarily by young gymnasts secondary to repetitive load bearing on the distal radius. Patients report insidious-onset wrist pain with physeal tenderness on examination and characteristic physeal widening on radiographs. Treatment typically involves prolonged immobilization, posing challenges for an otherwise highly active population. Current literature is limited when describing the overall treatment outcomes of gymnast wrist. This study aimed to understand the demographics, treatment outcomes, and return-to-sport timelines in a large patient sample.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Pediatric patients from 2016 to 2023 were identified using ICD-10 codes for &#x201C;gymnast wrist&#x201D; and wrist pain. Adults, acute fractures, non-gymnasts, and congenital etiologies were excluded. We collected patient data, Child Opportunity Index (COI), activity, treatment, radiographs, and outcomes. Statistical tests included chi-square, t-test, and Wilcoxon rank-sum analysis.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 78 wrists in 62 patients (60, 97% female) with an average age of 11.8&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1.7 (range, 6.9&#x2013;15.4) were included. Average time to presentation was 12.2&#x2009;weeks after symptom onset. All patients presented with wrist pain and tenderness over the physis, including 35.5% with symptoms on the dominant side, 38.7% on the nondominant side, and 25.8% with bilateral symptoms. The affected individuals averaged 15.9&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;9.1&#x2009;h of gymnastics participation per week. On initial wrist radiographs, 43 (69%) had distal radial physeal widening, 45 (73%) had juxtaphyseal sclerosis, and 12 (19%) had positive ulnar variance. For initial treatment, 55 (89%) were treated with splinting/rest/avoidance of weight-bearing with or without PT, 5 (8%) with short arm cast, and 2 (3%) underwent surgery. Thirty-two (53%) patients had resolved tenderness and return to sport after initial non-operative treatment. Among these 32 patients, average time to resolved tenderness was 7.4&#x2009;weeks and average time to return to sport was 8.6&#x2009;weeks. Approximately 23% of patients who initially improved with non-operative treatment later developed recurrent symptoms requiring a new period of rest. No significant differences were found in age, height, weight, body mass index (BMI), activity frequency, or prescribed treatment duration between patients whose symptoms resolved versus those whose symptoms persistent/recurred. Seven (11%) patients progressed to growth arrest, all of whom were eventually treated with ulnar shortening osteotomy.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Only about half of the patients with gymnast wrist respond well to conservative treatment. Recurrence rates are high, necessitating extended breaks from competitive athletics. More than 10% of patients progress to growth arrest requiring surgery.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Further prospective research is needed to identify risk factors for persistent or recurrent wrist pain in gymnasts.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Musculoskeletal deformity in ambulant children with cerebral palsy (CP) is often addressed with single-event multi-level surgery (SEMLS). Despite its wide use, there is weak evidence on the effectiveness of SEMLS in improving gait and function, and variation in surgical practices and clinical indications. The aim of this study was to undertake national surveillance of current SEMLS practice in children with CP in the United Kingdom.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A national prospective cohort study of diplegic children (5&#x2013;16&#x2009;years) with Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) level I&#x2013;III was conducted. Between April 2019 and March 2022, children who attended any hospital providing SEMLS in the United Kingdom, and who were deemed eligible to undergo SEMLS were recruited. Routine clinical data including GMFCS level, gait analysis data as summarized by the Gait Profile Score (GPS), motor function (FMS), and details of the surgical interventions were collected. Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) were assessed at baseline and 1&#x2009;year post recruitment or surgery in a subgroup of consented participants.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 202 children were recruited over a 36-month period. In total, 152 children (75%) underwent surgery within the study period. The mean GMFCS, GPS, and FMS (5&#x2009;m, 50&#x2009;m, 500&#x2009;m) scores at baseline for these children were 2.47 (0.68), 15.7 (4.8), and 4.01 (1.64), 3.09 (1.75), and 2.38 (1.76), respectively. In surgical patients, there was an overall improvement of GPS and FMS scores at 1&#x2009;year (12.6 (3.9) and 4.14 (1.39), 3.50 (1.57) and 2.68 (1.84)), and the GMFCS level remained stable. Similarly, in non-surgical patients, there was no change in GMFCS level (2.56 (0.55) versus 2.71 (0.49)), but contrary to the surgical group, there was no overall improvement to GPS and FMS scores at 1&#x2009;year. Of the 72 patients who completed the baseline PROM (in the consented cohort), 53% completed this at the 1-year follow-up. In surgical patients, there was overall improvement of GOAL at 1&#x2009;year, but no change in the non-surgical patients.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The results from this national study in the United Kingdom indicate that SEMLS is effective in improving gait pattern, as measured by the GPS and patient-reported functional mobility as measured by the GOAL at 1&#x2009;year from SEMLS.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This study has assessed current SEMLS practice in the United Kingdom and laid the foundation for the development of large-scale randomized trials on the management of this complex patient population.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is defined as &#x201C;perceived wellbeing in physical, mental, and social domains of health.&#x201D; This study aimed to evaluate HRQOL in children with the most common physical disabilities and examine its relationship with gross motor ability.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> In this institutional review board (IRB)-approved retrospective study, the parent-reported Pediatric Outcomes Data Collection Instrument (PODCI) and Section D of the Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM-D) were administered to ambulatory children aged 2&#x2013;18 with a diagnosis of cerebral palsy (CP; GMFCS II), arthrogryposis, achondroplasia, or Morquio syndrome during clinical visits to the Gait Laboratory. The PODCI assesses perceptions across six domains associated with mobility, pain, and happiness. It is validated for children (age 2&#x2013;10&#x2009;years) and adolescents (age 11&#x2013;18&#x2009;years). PODCI results were compared to published norms (TDY) using T-tests. The relationship between PODCI and GMFM-D scores was analyzed with Pearson correlations. To examine differences in HRQOL between diagnoses, pairwise comparisons of PODCI scores using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test with Bonferroni corrections was conducted.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Children and adolescent groups within all four diagnoses demonstrated limited mobility and higher pain compared to TDY (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.015). Happiness was lower in children and adolescents with CP, arthrogryposis multiplex congenital (AMC), and children with Morquio syndrome compared to TDY (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.002). Among diagnostic groups, global function was higher (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001) in people with achondroplasia (83(2)), compared to people with AMC (73(3)), CP (72(2)), and Morquio syndrome (66(4)). Global functioning was higher in people with AMC (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05) and CP (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01) compared to Morquio. Despite functional differences, there were no significant differences between the four diagnoses in pain (p&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.10). Happiness was lower in people with CP (80(3)) compared to achondroplasia (90(3); p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01). GMFM-D was associated with the PODCI mobility domains for all diagnoses (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.31 to 0.79, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.03), but was not correlated with the happiness domain for any group (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;&#x2212;0.16 to 0.092; p&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.14). GMFM-D and PODCI pain scores were correlated only in children with achondroplasia (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.355; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Significant limitations in HRQOL are seen in children with the most common physical disabilities of childhood. Pain is present at higher levels than non-disabled peers and tends not to be related to low motor function. Happiness was also not associated with gross motor function, suggesting the need to examine other contributors when mental health concerns exist in children with physical disabilities.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> It is essential to utilize patient-reported outcomes to best understand and assist in the management of HRQOL in children and adolescents with lifelong physical disabilities.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Depressive symptoms are reported to be higher for individuals with cerebral palsy (CP); however, as patients with CP often lack effective means of communication, the prevalence of depression may be underestimated. The objective of this study was to better understand the prevalence of depression in the CP population as determined by self-reported depressed mood and/or prescribed antidepressants (as a surrogate measure in patients unable to provide self-report).</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> This retrospective cohort study examined adults (&#x2265;18&#x2009;years) with CP seen in an academic medical center from 2006 to 2016. The associations between depression and patient characteristics (demographics, comorbidities, gross motor function, medication) were analyzed to determine any association with depression. We also identified commonly used antidepressants.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> In total, 101 of 501(20.2%) CP patients (31+ 13&#x2009;years, 53% F) met the criteria for depression. Of the patients without CP, 31/240 (13.1%) met the criteria for depression. The depressed and non-depressed groups did not differ in age, weight, height, body mass index (BMI), or gender. There was no significant difference in depression between ambulatory and non-ambulatory patients (21% versus 19%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.7). GI comorbidity, stimulants, antipsychotics, analgesics, benzodiazepines, and antispasmodics use were associated with higher rates of depression (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) were the most prescribed antidepressants.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> One of five adult CP patients in our sample met the criteria for depression, a substantially greater rate than that identified through self-report alone. Although ambulatory status was not found to be associated with depression, non-ambulatory patients are more likely to have difficulty communicating their symptoms, which could confound estimates of depression prevalence in this population.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> The significance of this study lies in uncovering a potentially underestimated prevalence of depression among individuals with CP. Our study reveals that 20.2% of adult CP patients met the criteria for depression&#x2014;significantly higher than estimates based solely on self-report. The findings emphasize the limitations of relying on self-disclosure in a population where effective communication may be challenging. In addition, the study identifies associations between depression and various patient characteristics, shedding light on factors that may contribute to depressive symptoms in this population. The results underscore the critical importance of employing comprehensive screening measures beyond self-report to accurately assess and address depression in individuals with CP.</p>

        <p>LOE-Diagnostic-Level I</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Three-dimensional gait analysis (3DGA) is the gold standard for quantifying gait deviation in children with cerebral palsy (CP). Where 3DGA is unavailable, observational gait analysis using the Edinburgh Visual Gait Score (EVGS) has shown moderate reliability and accuracy. The addition of mobile app slow-motion video analysis may improve the accuracy and reliability of this technique. This study prospectively evaluates the accuracy and reliability of mobile app&#x2013;enhanced observational gait analysis (mOGA) when compared to the gold standard of 3DGA in children with CP.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Slow-motion gait video was captured using two Apple iPhone 8S units while simultaneous 3DGA was acquired using a 12-camera infrared system. Using a low-cost commercially available slow-motion video analysis mobile app (Dartfish Express) on an iPad Pro, two observers (orthopedic surgery resident and attending pediatric orthopedic surgeon) made 11 quantitative mOGA measurements per limb. Inter-class correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to compare reliability between observers and between methods. Pearson&#x2019;s correlation coefficient and Spearman&#x2019;s rank correlation coefficient were used to determine correlation of error magnitude with Gait Profile Score and Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS), respectively.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Thirty-five subjects with CP were recruited for the study (26 M, 9 F; GMFCS I&#x2009;=&#x2009;7; GMFCS II&#x2009;=&#x2009;21, GMFCS III&#x2009;=&#x2009;7; mean&#x2009;=&#x2009;12&#x2009;years, range&#x2009;=&#x2009;6&#x2013;18&#x2009;years). Subjects had significant gait deviation as measured by the Gait Profile Score (GPS), with a mean GPS of 12.55 (SD&#x2009;=&#x2009;3.97). There was excellent overall reliability between raters for the mOGA technique (ICC&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.964). Of the 11 mOGA measurements, inter-rater reliability was good to excellent (ICC&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.75) for nine measurements and moderate (ICC&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.5&#x2013;0.75) for two measurements. When compared with the gold standard of 3DGA, mOGA had excellent reliability for both the less experienced (ICC&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.927) and more experienced (ICC&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.947) rater. Reliability between mOGA and 3DGA was good to excellent for six measurements, with no measurement having poor reliability (ICC&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.5) and all measurements having acceptable error magnitude. The error magnitude was not correlated to GPS or GMFCS (p&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.05), indicating that the technique could be used in patients with increased gait deviation and functional impairment.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> mOGA has good reliability between raters and acceptable accuracy compared with 3DGA.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> mOGA in children with CP can allow for enhanced communication between providers using low-cost technology. Further studies should clarify the role of mOGA in assisting with treatment decision-making and outcome assessment in environments where 3DGA is not possible or available.</p>

</p>
        <p>LOE-Not Applicable-Level III</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Anterior pelvic tilt (APT) is common in children with cerebral palsy (CP) and may be associated with excessive lumbar lordosis, back pain, and functional limitations. Factors related to increased APT are unclear but may be associated with hamstring length, proximal muscle strength, sagittal plane gait deviations, or orthopedic surgery. This study aims to determine risk factors for pathologic change in APT in ambulatory children with CP.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> In this institutional review board (IRB)-approved retrospective study, ambulatory children with bilateral spastic CP were identified from our institutional gait lab database from 2002 to 2022. Pairs of gait analyses were used to measure change in APT with and without surgical interventions. A mixed-effects linear regression analysis was conducted to predict which patient and surgical factors influenced change in APT between gait analyses. A logistic mixed-effects generalized linear regression was also performed to identify factors associated with an APT increase of 5&#xB0; or 10&#xB0;.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> In total, 528 children with CP were analyzed, 422 in the surgical group (GMFCS level I (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;35), II (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;281), III (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;106)) and 106 in the non-surgical group (GMFCS level I (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;17), II (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;64), III (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;25)), with mean ages of 11.1&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;3.8 and 10.0&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;3.6&#x2009;years at first gait analysis and of 13.2&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;6.2 and 12.3&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;3.8&#x2009;years at the follow-up gait analysis, respectively. Both the surgical and non-surgical groups exhibited APT at last follow-up, at 20&#xB0;&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;9&#xB0; and 20&#xB0;&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;9&#xB0;, respectively (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.63). Prior rhizotomy and hamstring lengthening (medial, medial&#x2009;+&#x2009;lateral) were significant factors for increasing APT, while Achilles lengthening, jump gait pattern, increased stance hip flexion, and high initial APT, were related to decreasing APT (Table 1). The mean change in APT after medial and medial&#x2009;+&#x2009;lateral hamstring lengthening was 1&#xB0;&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;9&#xB0; (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.046) and 4&#xB0;&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;9&#xB0; (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001), respectively. The mean change in APT in children with history of rhizotomy was 2&#xB0;&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;11&#xB0; (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.44).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Rather than being solely related to hamstring lengthening, factors associated with changes in APT were multifactorial, with prior rhizotomy having the most profound effect. Contrary to conventional thinking, the presence of high initial APT was not a risk factor for further progression. Factors associated with ankle equinus&#x2014;jump gait and Achilles lengthening&#x2014;also had a protective effect.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Identified risk factors for change in APT should be considered when developing treatment programs for children with bilateral CP, particularly for those with a normal or retroverted pelvis given their inherent susceptibility to worsening pelvic tilt.</p>

        <p>LOE-Prognostic-Level III</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> The purpose of this study was to analyze the association between patient satisfaction and increase in knee range of motion (KRM) after rectus femoris transfer (RFT) in cerebral palsy (CP).</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Ninety-eight patients with spastic diplegic CP, Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) I&#x2013;III, and who underwent RFT, with pre- and postoperative gait analyses, were included in the study. They were divided into three groups according to the change in KRM after RFT: (1) Group reduction (GR): reduction&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;1 standard deviation (SD); (2) Group unchanged (GU): reduction or increase&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;1 SD; and (3) Group improvement (GI): increase&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;1 SD. Demographic data, kinematics, Gait Deviation Index (GDI), and self-reported questionnaire were analyzed, and the results compared among groups.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> The mean age at surgery and the follow-up time were 14.2 and 3.04&#x2009;years, respectively. After surgical intervention, the KRM was reduced in 6 (6.1%), unchanged in 69 (70.4%), and increased in 23 (23.5%) patients. No comparisons were made with GR due to the small number of patients in this group (6). Age at surgery (GU 14.3&#x2009;years/GI 14.3&#x2009;years), follow-up time (GU 3.2&#x2009;years/GI 2.7&#x2009;years), GMFCS distribution, GDI increase (GU 8.1/GI 11), increase in peak knee flexion in the swing phase (GU 6.40/GI 7.30), and change in Gillette Functional Assessment Questionnaire walking ability score (GU&#x2009;+&#x2009;0.8/GI &#x2212;0.1) showed no difference when comparing GU and GI. The minimal knee flexion in stance phase was reduced (&#x2212;14.30) in GI and increased (+4.80) in GU (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). The prevalence of other surgical procedures performed concomitant to RFT was also similar between GU and GI, except for hip adductor surgical lengthening, which was observed in 13% of the patients in GU and 34.8% in GI (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02). Finally, 24.6% of the patients from GU and 13% from GI were extremely satisfied with the treatment results (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.243), whereas 34.8% of the patients in both groups were satisfied. According to the parents&#x2019; perspective, 23.2% from GU and 13% from GI were extremely satisfied (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.298), whereas 36.2% from GU and 39.1% from GI were satisfied with the outcome (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.803).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In the present study, the increase in KRM after RFT was related to reduction of knee flexion in stance phase. The improvement in KRM did not generate higher levels of satisfaction with treatment.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> The outcomes after RFT in CP have been frequently analyzed using tridimensional gait analysis. The evidence regarding patient satisfaction regarding this procedure remains scarce.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Non-ambulant (Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) IV and V) children with cerebral palsy (CP) undergo surgical interventions designed to manage pain, facilitate seating, and improve their health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The CPCHILD questionnaire was specifically designed to measure HRQoL in children with severe non-ambulatory CP and has been shown valid and reliable. However, the responsiveness and sensitivity to change of all CPCHILD domains has yet to be demonstrated in this population. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to report the responsiveness of the CPCHILD in non-ambulant children with CP undergoing hip and spine surgery.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Parents or caregivers of non-ambulant children with CP undergoing spine or hip surgery at our hospital between 2011 and 2019 completed the CPCHILD questionnaire at baseline and 6, 12, and 24&#x2009;months post-operative. This prospectively collected cohort was used to assess the responsiveness of the CPCHILD domains, as measured by the standard response mean (SRM) and the effect size (ES). Sensitivity to change was assessed by the standard error of measurement (SEM) and the minimal detectable change at the 90% confidence level (MDC90) from preoperative measurement to each follow-up measurement.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> One-hundred and eight patients with CP (38% GMFCS level IV; 62% level V) underwent spine or hip surgery at a mean age of 11.5&#x2009;years (SD&#x2009;=&#x2009;4.2). There were no statistically significant differences in cohort characteristics at each follow-up measurement. At 24&#x2009;months of follow-up, significant score improvements were seen in the personal (6.5, SD&#x2009;=&#x2009;21.2; 95% confidence interval (CI)&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.6&#x2013;11.5; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01), positioning (7.8, SD&#x2009;=&#x2009;15.7; 95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;4.1&#x2013;11.5); p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), and health (4.9, SD&#x2009;=&#x2009;20.0; 95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.3&#x2013;9.5; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.04) domains. A small ES and SRM were detected in the personal domain (ES, 0.39; SRM, 0.44), a moderate ES and SRM were detected in the positioning domain (ES, 0.54; SRM, 0.70), and a small ES and SRM were detected in the health domain (ES, 0.28; SRM, 0.32). The SEM and MDC90 for the personal domain were, respectively, 4.7 and 9.2 points, for the positioning domain 4.1 points and 8.1 points, and for the health domain 4.9 points and 9.6 points.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The CPCHILD questionnaire is currently our best tool to assess HRQoL in children with severe CP; however, we found only the Personal, Positioning, and Health domains to be responsive to change after spine and lower extremity orthopedic surgery.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Surgeons should interpret CPCHILD scores with caution as not all domains are responsive to change after orthopedic surgery.</p>

        <p>LOE-Therapeutic-Level IV</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) type 1 has a devastating natural course. Scoliosis and hip subluxation are common in non-ambulatory patients with SMA. Nusinersen, the first Food and Drug Administration-approved therapy for SMA, has not only prolonged survival, but has also improved motor function in SMA type 1. However, the impact of Nusinersen treatment on the development of spine and hip deformities remains unclear.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> We conducted a retrospective electronic health record database review. We included patients with SMA type 1 born between 2017 and 2021, the diagnosis confirmed by genetic testing and received intrathecal Nusinersen (Spinraza&#xAE;) therapy. Patients having &lt;2&#x2009;years radiological follow-up, inadequate clinical or radiographic data, first Nusinersen dose &gt;6&#x2009;months old, and SMA treatment other than Nusinersen were excluded. We obtained demographic parameters, age at first Nusinersen dose, total number of intrathecal Nusinersen administrations, and Children&#x2019;s Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test of Neuromuscular Disorders (CHOP-INTEND) assessment scores of motor function. Radiological evaluation was also performed to assess parasol rib deformity, scoliosis, pelvic obliquity, and hip subluxation.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> We included 29 patients, mean age 3.7&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1.1&#x2009;years (range, 2&#x2013;6&#x2009;years), male to female ratio 1.07. Mean number of intrathecal Nusinersen administrations was 8.9&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;2.9 (range, 4&#x2013;19). There was a significant correlation between CHOP-INTEND score and number of Nusinersen administrations (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.539, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.05). Correlations between CHOP-INTEND score and patient age (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.361) or age at first Nusinersen dose (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.39) were not significant (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.076 and p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.054, respectively). 93.1% of the patients had scoliosis, 69% had pelvic obliquity, and 60.7% had hip subluxation, after a mean 3.3&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1.1&#x2009;years of follow-up (range, 2&#x2013;6). Distribution of age, total number of Nusinersen administrations, age at first Nusinersen dose, and CHOP-INTEND scores were the same across patients with or without scoliosis, pelvic obliquity, and hip subluxation. There was also no significant correlation between these parameters and progression rate of scoliosis, hip subluxation, or pelvic obliquity.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Prior to the introduction of disease-modifying therapies, management of musculoskeletal deformities was rarely discussed in SMA type 1 due to limited survival. Although Nusinersen treatment changed the natural course of SMA type 1 in terms of overall survival and motor function, progressive scoliosis and hip subluxation remain significant problems in most cases.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Significant improvements in SMA type 1 regarding overall survival and motor function in the disease-modifying therapy era should encourage us to reconsider our management algorithms for treating spine deformity and hip subluxation, from only observation toward surgical reconstruction.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Arthrogryposis describes several conditions characterized by multiple congenital joint contractures. Surgical interventions for knee flexion contractures have achieved extension to redirect the arc of motion and improve ambulation but have not demonstrated maintained increases in total range of motion (ROM) over time. The purpose of this study is to review our patients&#x2019; latest ROM and ambulation status that underwent posterior knee release, proximal femoral shortening, and peroneal nerve decompression.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective chart and radiographic review was performed on patients presenting with arthrogryposis from 2016 through September of 2021 who underwent the above procedure. Patients were included if they had a minimum 2-year follow-up. Charts were reviewed for preoperative and latest follow-up ROM, ambulation status, and any complications. An immediate postoperative ROM was also reviewed to determine if there were any decreases over time. Group comparisons were performed with Friedman&#x2019;s test and pairwise comparisons were performed using Dunn&#x2019;s test. Fisher&#x2019;s exact test was used to compare preoperative and most recent follow-up ambulation.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Twenty-nine patients with 51 limbs were included in the final analysis. The mean age at surgery was 6.0&#x2009;years (&#xB1;&#x2009;3.4&#x2009;years). The mean follow-up was 40.5&#x2009;months (&#xB1;&#x2009;15.1&#x2009;months). The median preoperative flexion deformity was 45&#xB0; (interquartile range (IQR)&#x2009;=&#x2009;20&#xB0;) and this improved to 3&#xB0; (IQR&#x2009;=&#x2009;12&#xB0;) (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001). The mean preoperative arc of motion was 50&#xB0; (IQR 30&#xB0;) and this improved to 85&#xB0; (IQR 30&#xB0;) (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001). No changes in ROM occurred between immediate postoperative ROM and most recent follow-up (Figure 1). Thirty-eight percent of patients were able to ambulate preoperatively and this improved to 93% at most recent follow-up (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001). Sixteen of 29 patients had at least limited ability to ambulate in the community, and 11/29 were home ambulators. Ten patients experienced a complication during the follow-up period. Five patients had postoperative neuritis which was treated conservatively with gabapentin and eventually weaned off. Five patients sustained fractures: three intraoperatively, requiring pinning of the distal femoral physis, one in the acute postoperative period, which was treated conservatively, and one patient sustained a femur fracture at 29&#x2009;months and required fixation in the operative theater.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Posterior knee release with proximal femoral shortening and peroneal nerve decompression achieved increased and maintained ROM in patients with knee flexion deformities at a minimum 2-year follow-up. In addition, over 90% were at least home ambulators.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This study demonstrates maintained knee ROM and ambulation improvements at a minimum 2-year follow-up using a novel technique.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> The epiphyseal tubercle provides stability to the capital femoral epiphysis and acts as a rotational pivot point in slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE). A posterior tilt of the epiphysis (retroversion) is recognized as a crucial factor in SCFE development. This study investigates the impact of childhood obesity on the morphology of the capital femoral epiphysis in children without pre-existing hip disorders.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> After institutional review board (IRB) approval, we included patients aged 7&#x2013;19&#x2009;years who had undergone pelvic computed tomography (CT) from 2012 to 2022. Inclusion criteria were no documented bone/joint disorders and quality for three-dimensional (3D) segmentation. We applied validated custom software (VirtualHip) for automated femoral head and neck segmentation. We measured epiphyseal tubercle height, peripheral cupping (12 o&#x2019;clock position), and epiphyseal tilt. Bilateral measurements were averaged. We modeled the association between body mass index (BMI) and each measurement using linear models. We compared the mean differences in the measurements for each BMI group at each age using t-tests and corrected the p-values for multiple testing using the Bonferroni method.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Our study encompassed 8717 patients, equally distributed across the sexes. The average BMI percentile was 61%&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;33%, with 24% classified as obese (BMI&#x2009;&gt;=&#x2009;95th percentile). After adjusting for age and sex, obese subjects had reduced epiphyseal tubercle height (estimated differences: &#x2212;0.6% (95% confidence interval (CI): &#x2212;0.8 to &#x2212;0.4; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001)), a more posteriorly tilted epiphysis (estimated difference: &#x2212;1.6% (95% CI: &#x2212;2.2 to &#x2212;1.0)), and decreased peripheral cupping (estimated difference: &#x2212;0.3% (95% CI: &#x2212;0.6 to &#x2212;0.1)) compared to non-obese counterparts. Figure 1 shows trends concerning the measurements across all age groups. A smaller epiphyseal tubercle and a more posteriorly tilted epiphysis in obese children were consistent findings across all age groups until approximately age 14 (Table 1). Peripheral cupping was statistically lower in obese compared to non-obese individuals after age 13.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In this comprehensive automated 3D analysis of pelvic CT scans encompassing 8717 subjects, our observations underline that obese children exhibit a smaller epiphyseal tubercle, greater posterior tilt of the epiphysis, and reduced peripheral cupping compared to their non-obese counterparts.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Our study describes the impact of obesity on capital femoral epiphysis development in children. The reduced epiphyseal tubercle and diminished peripheral cupping observed in obese children are morphological features known to compromise epiphyseal stability, while posteriorly tilted epiphysis increases shear forces on the growth plate, thereby increasing the risk of slip. These findings contribute to our understanding of the pathomechanics underlying the association between obesity and SCFE.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Avascular necrosis (AVN) remains the most dreaded complication of unstable slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) treatment. Newer closed reduction techniques (with perfusion monitoring) have emerged as a technically straightforward means to address residual SCFE deformity while still minimizing the risk of osteonecrosis. However, limited data exist regarding the reliability of perfusion monitoring to predict the development of AVN. The purpose of this study was to evaluate this reliability.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> We retrospectively reviewed all patients with unstable SCFE who underwent closed or open reduction with epiphyseal perfusion monitoring using an intracranial pressure (ICP) probe from 2015 to 2023 at a single institution with minimum 6-month radiographic follow-up. Demographic, clinical, and radiographic data were recorded, including duration of symptoms, type of reduction, capsulotomy performed, presence of a waveform on ICP monitoring after epiphyseal fixation, and development of AVN on follow-up radiographs.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Our cohort included 33 hips (32 patients). The average age was 12.5&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1.8&#x2009;years, with a median follow-up of 13.9&#x2009;months. Eleven hips were treated with open reduction using the modified Dunn technique (10 hips) or anterior approach (1 hip), and 22 hips were treated with inadvertent (5 hips) or purposeful closed reduction using the Leadbetter technique (17 hips). Overall, 7 of 33 hips (21.2%) developed AVN, 5 of which (16.7%) had a pulsatile waveform intraoperatively on perfusion monitoring. The incidence of AVN after closed reduction with a detectable waveform was 25% (5 of 20 hips). There was no significant association between time to surgery (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.273) or type of reduction (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.378) and incidence of AVN.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In this series, the presence of a pulsatile waveform on intraoperative epiphyseal perfusion monitoring during reduction of unstable slips did not preclude the development of AVN.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> To our knowledge, this is the first study to report development of AVN after demonstrable intraoperative epiphyseal perfusion following closed reduction of unstable slips.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Femoral head avascular necrosis (AVN) is a devastating complication that can occur in the setting of trauma to the hip. Bone scintigraphy (BoS) can be used to evaluate femoral head perfusion, but current evidence in support of its use in the pediatric population is lacking. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that BoS would have high sensitivity and specificity to accurately diagnose femoral head AVN.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> We performed a retrospective review of patients who underwent BoS to assess femoral head perfusion following treatment of traumatic femoral neck fracture, hip dislocation, or slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) at a single pediatric tertiary referral center. All patients had minimal clinical follow-up of 1&#x2009;year. Assessment of intra-operative femoral head perfusion was also recorded if performed. Results of BoS and intra-op assessments were compared to radiographic findings of AVN at final follow-up.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Thirty patients (47 hips) (23 M, 7&#x2009;F; age: 12.8&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1.6&#x2009;years; follow-up: 24.5&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;15.3&#x2009;months) were included. Radiographic AVN (RAVN) developed in 13% of hips. Seven hips had an abnormal BoS: 6 hips had absent perfusion and 1 hip had diminished perfusion. All six hips with absent perfusion went on to develop RAVN with collapse. The hip with diminished perfusion did not go on to femoral head collapse. No hip with normal BoS developed radiographic evidence of AVN at final follow up. Twenty-one hips underwent intra-op perfusion assessment, 15/21 were evaluated with femoral head drilling with 3/15 indicating absent perfusion. Fourteen of 21 were evaluated with intraosseous pressure (IOP) monitoring with 2/14 indicating absent perfusion. Eight of 21 hips were evaluated with both techniques with concordant absent perfusion in 1/8 hips, and this finding of absent perfusion was not noted on BoS and this hip did not develop RAVN. BoS demonstrating absent perfusion had a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 98% in predicting RAVN. Evidence of femoral head perfusion at the time of surgery (drilling or IOP) had a sensitivity of 17% and a specificity of 79% in predicting RAVN.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> BoS demonstrates high sensitivity and specificity for predicting RAVN and femoral head collapse postoperatively in the setting of trauma and SCFE compared to intra-operative assessments.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Clinicians should have increased suspicion for impending femoral head collapse if there is absent perfusion on BoS at 6&#x2013;12&#x2009;weeks post-op, even with evidence of preserved femoral head perfusion at the time of surgery. Early diagnosis of AVN can allow for earlier interventions to improve femoral head perfusion prior to femoral head collapse.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Avascular necrosis (AVN) of the femoral head is the leading cause of morbidity following slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE). To identify patients at risk for AVN, Loder developed a classification system based on weight-bearing status (WBS). While sensitive in predicting which patients are at risk for AVN, determining the Loder classification can be subjective and lacks specificity for AVN. We hypothesized that only Loder-unstable patients with epiphyseal instability are at risk of AVN.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Retrospective chart review of SCFE patients who underwent closed operative treatment at a single institution from 2007 to 2022. Patient data, surgical details, and all imaging were analyzed. Loder status was determined by whether the patient could independently weight-bear (WB) at presentation. Epiphyseal instability was defined as a change from preoperative to postoperative Southwick angle (SWA) over 15&#x2009;degrees with an operative note documenting a successful reduction, indicating there was relative motion between the epiphysis and metaphysis. The primary outcome was postoperative AVN rate. Statistical analysis was performed using R (version 4.3.1).</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> There were 458 hips in 397 patients identified. Three hundred sixty-six (80%) hips were Loder-stable with a 0% AVN rate at median follow-up of 15&#x2009;months (range, 7&#x2013;35&#x2009;months). Ninety-two (20%) hips were Loder-unstable, with an 11% (10/92) AVN rate at median follow-up of 16&#x2009;months (range, 4&#x2013;43&#x2009;months). Of the Loder-unstable patients, 34% (31/92) were epiphyseal-stable and 66% (61/92) were epiphyseal-unstable. The AVN rate of the Loder-unstable/epiphyseal-stable patients was 0% (0/31) at a median follow-up of 12&#x2009;months (range, 12&#x2013;32&#x2009;months). The AVN rate of the Loder-unstable/epiphyseal-unstable was 16% (10/61) at a median follow-up of 19&#x2009;months (range, 4&#x2013;48&#x2009;months) (Table A). The addition of epiphyseal stability as a classifier significantly increased the specificity of predicting AVN (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.005) (Table B).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The Loder classification is a sensitive preoperative screening tool for predicting risk of AVN following SCFE resulting in no false negatives. Epiphyseal stability, diagnosed intraoperatively, is an additional classifier that increases the specificity of predicting AVN risk without sacrificing sensitivity. Patients with confirmed epiphyseal instability are at the greatest risk of AVN and may benefit from perioperative and postoperative imaging or interventions.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> The addition of epiphyseal stability to the Loder classification increases physicians&#x2019; ability to identify patients at risk for developing AVN. Intraoperative assessment of epiphyseal stability is essential for treatment algorithms and counseling families. The results help explain the wide range of AVN rates for Loder-unstable patients in the literature as epiphyseal stability has not been previously accounted for.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> After a unilateral slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE), the contralateral hip is at risk for a subsequent SCFE. However, further information regarding risk factors involved in the development of contralateral hip SCFE must be investigated. The purpose of the study was to report the rate and risk factors for subsequent contralateral SCFE in adolescents treated for unilateral SCFE.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A case-control study utilizing aggregated multi-institutional electronic medical record (EMR) data between January 2003 and March 2023 was conducted. Skeletally immature children diagnosed with SCFE who underwent surgical management were included. Variables associated with contralateral SCFE were identified using multivariate logistic regression models that adjusted for patient characteristics and time of surgery, providing adjusted odds ratios. False discovery rate was accounted for via the Benjamini&#x2013;Hochberg method.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> 15.3% of patients developed contralateral SCFE with a mean of 296.53 (&#xB1;&#x2009;17.23 SE) days and a median of 190&#x2009;days following their initial SCFE. Increased thyrotropin (odds ratio (OR)&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.43, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.036), diabetes mellitus (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.67, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.005), severe obesity (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.81, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), history of human growth hormone (HGH) use (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.85, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), low vitamin D (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;5.75, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), younger age (boys under 12&#x2009;years of age (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.85, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), and girls under 11&#x2009;years of age (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.47, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.026)), and tobacco exposure (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.43, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) were significantly associated with an increased odds of developing contralateral disease.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In the largest study on this topic, we identified the rate, odds, and risk factors associated with development of contralateral SCFE. We found younger age, hypothyroidism, severe obesity, low Vitamin D, diabetes mellitus, and history of HGH use as independent risk factors.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Our findings can aid clinical decision making in at-risk patients.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Surgical hip dislocation with modified Dunn (MD) is a viable treatment option for moderate to severe unstable slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) at an experienced tertiary care center. In the acute setting, an experienced surgeon may not be immediately available for MD. However, in situ pinning (ISP) is a well-accepted treatment in the acute setting and is more familiar to the on-call orthopedic surgeon. To date, no literature exists on the impact of temporary ISP prior to MD to compare its impact on outcome. Our primary aim was to compare complication rate and radiographic outcome at 2&#x2009;years in patients with moderate/severe unstable SCFE undergoing primary MD versus ISP with subsequent MD.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Thirty-one patients underwent treatment for moderate/severe SCFE at a single institution. Demographics, surgical characteristics, and radiographic measurements were compared. Investigation of treatment outcomes was performed using linear regression models, adjusted for age and sex, to analyze continuous variables across ISP&#x2009;+&#x2009;MD and MD only treatment groups. Mean and standard deviation were calculated to summarize continuous variables, and the mean difference between treatment groups with a 95% confidence interval was calculated from the linear regression model for slip angle. Binary outcomes were explored through logistic regression models again adjusted for age and sex. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test assessed the significance of Merle d&#x2019;Aubign&#xE9; scores between the two groups.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Fifteen patients underwent ISP with subsequent MD; 16 patients underwent primary MD. Average time between ISP and MD was 47.86&#x2009;days. There was no difference in demographic characteristics, preoperative Southwick angle, alpha angle, or body mass index (BMI). Implant failure rate was 6.67% (ISP&#x2009;+&#x2009;MD) and 6.25% (MD), p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.094; both occurred at 3&#x2009;months postoperatively and required upsizing of femoral neck implants without loss of initial correction. The incidence of AVN was not significantly different between groups; 6.67% ISP&#x2009;+&#x2009;MD versus 12.5% MD, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.443. Merle d&#x2019;Aubign&#xE9; scores at final follow-up were 18 (ISP&#x2009;+&#x2009;MD) and 17 (MD), p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.581. There was no significant difference between groups in Tonnis grade, Southwick, or alpha angles at final follow-up.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> We demonstrate no difference in complication rate in patients with moderate/severe SCFE treated with primary MD compared to temporary ISP with subsequent conversion to MD.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Temporary ISP for moderate/severe unstable SCFE may be a safe alternative to primary MD if an experienced hip surgeon is not immediately available. This also allows additional time for patients and their family to understand the risk/benefit ratio for the MD surgery prior to conversion.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) is one of the most common hip disorders in adolescents. Multiple metabolic disorders have been associated with secondary SCFE, and the association of obesity with primary SCFE has been well studied. While the incidence of vitamin D deficiency in childhood has been increasing, few studies have examined a potential link with SCFE. This study investigates the impact of vitamin D on SCFE development and related complications.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A large comprehensive national database was queried for patients under age 9&#x2009;years who have records of calcidiol lab drawn between 9 and 18&#x2009;years of age. These patients are followed up until SCFE occurrences or until the patient turns 18&#x2009;years. Patients were divided into vitamin D adequate (calcidiol&#x2009;&gt;=&#x2009;30&#x2009;ng/mL) and vitamin D-deficient (calcidiol&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;30&#x2009;ng/mL) groups. Propensity score matching was performed adjusting for demographics and risk factors, including body mass index (BMI), medications, medical comorbidities, and laboratory values. Temporal analysis was performed comparing risks of SCFE development between the two cohorts. Statistical significance is held at 0.05.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> On preliminary analysis, 98,045 patients met the inclusion criteria. After matching, 34,552 in the vitamin D-deficient and 34,552 in the vitamin D-adequate groups were included. The average patient ages were 11.4&#x2009;years and 50% were female. In total, 136 (0.39%) and 48 (0.14%) patients developed SCFE in vitamin D-deficient and vitamin D-adequate groups, respectively (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001). In this study, 64.7% of SCFE development was attributed to vitamin D deficiency (risk ratio (RR)&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.833, 95% confidence interval (CI)&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.040&#x2013;3.936; hazard ratio (HR)&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.558, 95% CI (1.119&#x2013;2.168), p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This is one of the largest studies to date demonstrating the association between vitamin D deficiency and SCFE development. Vitamin D-deficient children are more susceptible to developing SCFE than those with adequate supplementation.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> These findings highlight the importance of managing adequate vitamin D supplementation in at-risk adolescents, especially among the obese, nutrient-deficient, and populations living further from the equator to lower the risk of future SCFE development.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Treatment of moderate to severe stable slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) remains a challenging problem. Open reduction by modified Dunn procedure carries a considerable risk of osteonecrosis (ON). Imhauser osteotomy can realign the deformity without the risk of ON, but the remaining metaphyseal bump is implicated with significant chondro-labral lesions and accelerated osteoarthritis. We conducted this study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Imhauser osteotomy combined with osteochondroplasty (OCP) through the surgical hip dislocation (SHD) approach.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A prospective series of 23 patients with moderate-severe stable SCFE underwent Imhauser osteotomy and OCP through SHD. The mean age was 14.4&#x2009;years (13&#x2013;20&#x2009;years) and the mean follow-up period was 45&#x2009;months (24&#x2013;66&#x2009;months). The outcome measures included clinical and radiological parameters, and Harris hip score (HHS) was used as a functional score.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> The mean HHS improved significantly from 65.39 to 93.3. The limb length discrepancy improved by a mean of 1.72&#x2009;cm. The mean flexion and abduction arcs showed a significant improvement (mean increase of 37.5&#xB0; and 18.5&#xB0;, respectively). The mean internal rotation demonstrated the most significant improvement (mean increase of 38.5&#xB0;). All the radiographic parameters improved significantly, including anterior and lateral slip angles (mean improvement 37.52&#xB0; and 44.37&#xB0;, respectively). The mean alpha angle decreased by 39.19&#xB0;. The articulo-trochanteric distance significantly increased to a mean of 23.26&#x2009;mm. No cases of ON or chondrolysis were identified.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Combined Imhauser osteotomy and OCP through the surgical dislocation approach provides a comprehensive and safe management of moderate to severe stable SCFE.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Additional OCP should be considered with corrective osteotomies in moderate and severe stable slips.</p>

</p>
        <p>LOE-Therapeutic-Level II</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> A growing number of pediatric and young adult patients are undergoing total joint arthroplasty (TJA) due to rheumatic, congenital, degenerative, and traumatic joint diseases as well as treatment for malignant blood disorders that lead to avascular necrosis (AVN). Surgical considerations differ from adult populations, contributing to patient and provider hesitancy. Data are now available to examine short- and medium-term clinical outcomes, but little is known about long-term functional or quality of life (QoL) outcomes.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective cohort study was performed on patients who have undergone total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) at our institution between 2000 and 2022. Clinical data were collected from patient records. Functional outcomes were assessed using the modified Harris Hip score (HHS) and Oxford Knee score (OKS), and QoL outcomes were assessed using the 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36v2). Scores were averaged for each patient preoperatively, and between 0 and 6&#x2009;months, 6&#x2013;12&#x2009;months, 1&#x2013;2&#x2009;years, 2&#x2013;5&#x2009;years, 5&#x2013;10&#x2009;years, and 10+&#x2009;years postoperatively. Exclusion criteria included less than 5&#x2009;years of follow-up, patients over age 25 at the time of surgery, TJA for oncologic treatment, and patients with mucopolysaccharidoses and other progressive degenerative diseases.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> In total, 112 TJAs in 95 patients were identified and consented to analysis (43% female, 55% male, 2% non-binary, average 17.3&#x2009;years of age at surgery). Eighty-eight THA patients (102 TJA) provided 189 HHS responses. Scores increased by a mean of 30.3 and 38.4 points, at 6&#x2009;months (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;28) and 10+&#x2009;years (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;16), respectively, from preoperative surveys (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;30). Seven TKA patients (10 TJA) had insufficient preoperative OKS data (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;1) and were not included in the final analysis. Ninety-three patients (110 TJA) provided 154 SF-36vs responses. Scores increased by a mean of 16.9 and 16.7 points at 6&#x2009;months (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;27) and 10+&#x2009;years (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;13), respectively, from preoperative surveys (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;21). Five revisions were necessary due to manufacturer implant recall (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;3), deep infection (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;1), and femur fracture (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;1).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Study data suggests that patients under the age of 25 experience significant improvement in both QoL and functional outcomes by 6&#x2009;months following TJA procedures and that these improvements are sustained for up to 10&#x2009;years. Non-recall-related revision rates are also like adult population TJA revision rates within the first 10&#x2009;years postoperatively.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This is one of the largest single institution samples to systemically track long-term functional and implant survivorship outcomes and one of the first to track QoL for pediatric and young adult TJA procedures.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Developmental hip dysplasia (DDH) is a common pediatric orthopedic condition with long-term implications for quality of life and is now considered the primary cause of hip arthritis requiring joint replacement. Complications of missed or delayed DDH may be minimized when diagnosed early when non-operative interventions (e.g. Pavlik harness) are highly successful. Current standard of care in the United States is selective ultrasound screening, performed only with abnormal physical examination, family history, or presence of risk factors. An updated cost-utility analysis, considering health utilities and costs, is warranted.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A Markov simulation model was designed representing six DDH screening strategies: (1) Universal ultrasound screening within first 2&#x2009;weeks (USB), (2) Selective screening within first 2&#x2009;weeks (SSB, high-risk patients screened with ultrasound, low-risk patients not screened), (3) Universal ultrasound screening at 6&#x2009;weeks (US6), (4) Universal hybrid screening (UHS, clinical instability receives ultrasound within first 2&#x2009;weeks while all others undergo ultrasound at 6&#x2009;weeks), (5) German model (ultrasound for high-risk patients within first 2&#x2009;weeks and all others at 6&#x2009;weeks), and (6) a no screening model (i.e. natural history of untreated DDH). A standardized DDH treatment algorithm was used, and a comprehensive literature review provided relevant probabilities and incidences, Medicare costs, and utilities. A hypothetical patient cohort was modeled from birth to death capped at age 100, with sensitivity analyses performed.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> From a societal perspective, the US6 strategy was more effective (77.06 versus 77.00 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)) and more costly ($5677.36 versus $5606.07) than SSB. Utilizing a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of &lt;$100,000/QALY, US6 was more cost-effective than SSB (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER)&#x2009;=&#x2009;$1111.78/QALY). From the payer perspective, a US6 approach was more costly ($4355.83 versus $4262.12) than SSB, but more cost-effective (ICER&#x2009;=&#x2009;$1461.27/QALY). The US6 strategy was overall cost-effective (&lt;$100,000/QALY) in 59.2% of 10,000 probabilistic sensitivity analysis (Figure 1) iterations assessing societal costs (versus 27.7% UHS, 7.2% USB, and 5.9% SSB) and 58.8% of payer iterations (versus 27.5% UHS, 7.6% USB, and 6.1% SSB). The second most cost-effective model was UHS (77.04 QALYs, societal&#x2009;=&#x2009;$5721.20, payer&#x2009;=&#x2009;$4391.79).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Universal screening at 6&#x2009;weeks of age or a universal hybrid screening model was cost-effective in screening for DDH compared to traditional selective screening models in the United States.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> These results may justify updated guidelines in the United States regarding appropriate screening for DDH, bringing our standards in line with many other countries where all children are screened for DDH with ultrasound.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> All hip surveillance programs for children with cerebral palsy (CP) rely on accurate quantification of the hip migration percentage (MP) to determine referral and treatment. Accurate reporting and measurement of the MP has been shown as a substantial barrier to hip surveillance implementation. This study validates a deep-learning algorithm to automatically measure MP on hip surveillance radiographs, with the goal of allowing broader access to &#x201C;specialist-level&#x201D; radiographic measurement.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Pelvic and femoral landmarks relevant for the calculation for MP were labeled by pediatric orthopedic surgeons on a de-identified data set of anteroposterior (AP) pelvis radiographs of children with CP. A deep-learning algorithm to automatically detect hip landmarks and calculate the MP was then created using a ResNet 18 and Cascaded Pyramid Network architecture. The algorithm was tested for accuracy on a prospectively collected set of AP pelvis radiographs, with &#x201C;ground truth&#x201D; MP measurements performed by pediatric orthopedic surgeons in their actual clinical practice. The mean absolute difference (MAD) between algorithm and surgeon was calculated with linear mixed modeling, and multi-variate analysis was used to determine sources of error. The sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) were calculated with an MP&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;30% representing a &#x201C;positive&#x201D; case.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 3354 pelvis radiographs from 1509 subjects with CP were included in the study (56% M, 44% F; mean age at X-ray, 8&#x2009;years; 14% Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) I, 15% GMFCS II, 6% GMFCS III, 24% GMFCS IV, and 36% GMFCS V). A total of 2500 X-rays from two centers were used to develop and optimize the algorithm. In total, 854 prospectively collected X-rays from 24 different international centers were utilized as a diverse external test set. When compared to the MP measurements calculated by each center&#x2019;s orthopedic surgeon, the algorithm had an MAD of 9.3% (95% confidence interval (CI): 8.7%&#x2013;9.9%), sensitivity of 84% , specificity of 85%, and AUC of 0.915. Increased error was correlated most strongly with increasing MP (b&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.117, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), and weakly with GMFCS 5 (b&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.04, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.047), presence of femoral implant (b&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.03, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.005), and increasing age (b&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.005, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> A deep-learning algorithm can automatically measure MP on hip surveillance radiographs with excellent discriminatory characteristics in a large and diverse set of &#x201C;real world&#x201D; radiographs. The measurement error of the algorithm falls within the published range of specialist error (MAD&#x2009;=&#x2009;4%&#x2013;13%).</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Incorporation of this deep-learning algorithm into the clinical workflow of community and non-specialist providers may remove a substantial barrier to the implementation of hip surveillance.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Adequate pain control and early mobilization are critical in the postoperative period following periacetabular osteotomy (PAO). Regional anesthesia can reduce postoperative pain, but certain techniques can increase the risk of postoperative motor block and delayed functional recovery. Continuous lumbar epidurals can not only provide excellent analgesia but also create challenges with early ambulation. Recently, suprainguinal fascia iliaca (SIFI) single-shot blocks have been shown to provide effective analgesia in PAO patients. The goal of this study was to compare opioid use, time to achieve inpatient physical therapy (PT) goals, and length of stay (LOS) between a cohort of patients receiving SIFI blocks and a cohort of patients receiving epidural analgesia (EA).</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> This retrospective single-surgeon comparative cohort study included all patients who underwent a PAO between 2012 and 2022. Regional anesthetic technique (SIFI versus EA), length of hospital stay, intra- and post-operative opioid use, pain scores, and time to achievement of PT milestones prior to discharge were recorded. Patients were excluded if they had any preexisting neuromuscular syndrome or neurosensory deficit. All opioid use was converted to morphine milligram equivalents (MME) using standard conversions.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 204 patients met the inclusion criteria; 164 patients received EA and 32 received a SIFI block. The average age of our cohort was 19.5&#x2009;years (range, 10&#x2013;35&#x2009;years). There were no significant differences in age, gender, race, or body mass index (BMI) between the two groups. Compared to EA patients, the SIFI block cohort had shorter mean LOS (2.9&#x2009;days versus 4.1&#x2009;days) (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) and lower total opioid use on post-operative days 0&#x2013;2 (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). Time to sit on edge of bed, time to ambulate&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;10 feet, and time to negotiate&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;3 stairs were achieved sooner in those who received a SIFI block compared to EA (Figure 1) (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). There were no differences in pain scores reported at inpatient PT visits.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> After PAO surgery, the SIFI block is associated with shorter hospital LOS, reduced postoperative opioid use, and earlier mobilization when compared with those who were managed with an epidural.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This is the largest direct comparison of patients receiving SIFI blocks with those receiving lumbar epidurals for PAO surgery. Our results support the use of SIFI blocks given the equivalent pain scores, lower opiate use, faster time to ambulation, and shorter LOS.</p>

        <p>LOE-Economic-Level II</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Virtual fracture clinics, in which patient&#x2019;s notes and radiographs are reviewed after referral from the Emergency Department (ED), to plan and implement further management, have become increasingly popular in clinical practice. They reduce burden of travel for unnecessary appointments to the hospital, saving patients time and money, as well as having environmental benefits. The main concern about this method of delivery of clinical care is safety, with the potential for missed injuries as the patient is not seen or examined in person. The purpose of this study was to determine the safety of Virtual Children&#x2019;s Fracture Clinics (VCFC) specifically with reference to time to review, missed/incorrect diagnoses, and return rate after discharge.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> This was a prospective consecutive case series study performed at a University Teaching Hospital. The VCFC database was used to identify all patients seen between August 2017 and May 2021. Records were reviewed and data recorded about the ED diagnosis, the orthopedic diagnosis and final outcome, unplanned return to clinic for a face-to-face (F2F) review, and later referral back for the same injury.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 5536 consecutive patients were seen in the VCFC over the study period (cost saving &#xA3;465,496). Mean time from ED visit to VCFC appointment was 2.25&#x2009;days. Median follow-up at the time of this study was 31&#x2009;months (range: 19&#x2013;63&#x2009;months). Thirty-eight patients (0.5%) required admission for urgent surgical intervention following their virtual clinic review. A total of 2325 patients (42%) were discharged from VCFC without further F2F follow-up. Sixty-three of these patients (3%) returned for unplanned F2F clinic. None were found to have missed injuries or required further interventions. The remaining 2262 patients never attended the hospital again during the entire study period, suggesting that there were no significant missed injuries. The diagnosis made in VCFC differed from ED diagnosis in 1921 cases (34%) (downgraded to a lesser injury in 1460, upgraded to more severe fracture type in 220).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This is the largest reported series of patients from a VCFC, with the longest follow-up, providing a solid basis for making conclusions about safety and missed/incorrect diagnoses. The VCFC model saved 110 F2F appointments per month. Our data demonstrate that the system allows prompt identification of the small number of patients requiring urgent attention and allows safe modification of the ED diagnosis without further F2F review.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> A 3% return rate after discharge from a VCFC, with no missed injuries at a minimum follow-up of 19&#x2009;months, confirms the safety of VCFCs. We advise those units that do not employ a VCFC model to strongly consider doing so.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Multiple hereditary exostoses (MHE), an autosomal dominant musculoskeletal disorder, is characterized by the development of multiple cartilage-capped exostoses originating from the physis, known as osteochondromas. The potential for these osteochondromas to impinge on the spinal cord is a clinical concern. Our study aims to determine the prevalence of osteochondromas in the spine in individuals with MHE. In addition, we aim to identify any risk factors for osteochondromas impinging on the spinal cord.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> We prospectively enrolled a cohort of MHE patients/families at a single institution from 2010 to 2022. Demographics, osteochondroma location, and clinical outcomes were documented. Magnetic resonance imagings (MRIs) were obtained and interpreted by musculoskeletal pediatric radiologists. Patients were categorized based on osteochondroma location: no spinal involvement, on the spinal column, in the spinal canal, or neural impinging. We also noted when osteochondromas were present on the scapula, ribs, or pelvis (aka &#x201C;harbinger lesions&#x201D;).</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Ninety-four MHE patients received an MRI. Almost 44 (46.8%) had osteochondromas on their spine. Around 22 (23.4%) had osteochondromas located only on their spinal column, 18 (19.1%) had an osteochondroma encroaching in their spinal canal, and 4 (4.3%) were found to have one causing neural impingement (Table 1). Of the four with neural impingement, and two displayed paraparesis requiring immediate surgical intervention (Figure 1). The remaining two patients were observed clinically and monitored with serial MRIs. One patient began to exhibit worsening paretic symptoms and had excision. The remaining patient remained stable throughout follow-up. Age, gender, and presence of harbinger lesions were not associated with neural impingement although logistic regression showed Hispanic individuals were ~32.8 times more likely to have neural impingement compared to white individuals (p = 0.0419).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Although nearly half of patients have osteochondromas on the spine, neural impingement is rare (4.3%) and resulted in operative intervention in 75% of cases. Age, gender, and harbinger lesions were note associated with neural impingement. Significance: Although the prevalence of osteochondromas of the spine approaches 50%, neural impingement is rare. This information can be used to inform clinical decision-making regarding screening MRIs.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Hardware removal (HWR) is a common procedure in the pediatric population. Yet, current literature is mixed on the risks and benefits especially in the elective setting. Identification of appropriate indications for HWR is essential to guiding treatment. The objective of this study was to assess the incidence of complications as well as identifying significant predictors of complications based on patient risk factors.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective cohort study was conducted using institutional CPT code 20680 database query. Patient demographics, comorbidities, peri-procedural data, and complications were recorded. Complications were subcategorized as infection, pain, and re-fracture. Data were analyzed for patient-specific and complication-specific factors.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 1452 patients met the inclusion criteria. The average age was 11.51&#x2009;years (range, 0&#x2009;+&#x2009;3 to 21&#x2009;+&#x2009;0&#x2009;years). There were 107 (7.4%) complications within the cohort, of which 44.9% were infections (75% superficial and 25% deep), 19.6% were refractures, 17.7% had pain (68.4% had pain symptoms unresolved with HWR and 31.6% had new-onset pain after HWR), and 17.8% had various other complications. The overall rate of superficial infection was 2.5%, deep infection was 0.83%, refracture was 1.44%, pain symptoms unresolved with HWR was 0.9%, and new-onset pain was 0.4%. A total of 464 (32%) patients had a comorbidity. 9.5% were diagnosed with a neuromuscular syndrome such as cerebral palsy, 2.5% had osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), 1.3% had rickets, 0.55% had Neurofibromatosis Type-1, 1.3% had a skeletal dysplasia, 2.6% had a growth plate disorder such as Blount&#x2019;s disease, 4.6% had another syndrome or growth disorder such as Morquio syndrome, 0.83% had a bone disease such as fibrous dysplasia, 3.9% were obese, and 4.5% had a systemic illness/disease such as sickle cell disease. Of the 107 complications, 42% were associated with comorbidities (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.019), OI having the highest at 16.2% and growth plate disorders at 15.8%. There was no difference in complications with elective versus trauma cases. For refractures after HWR, there was no difference among type of hardware used and which bone the HWR occurred. For infections, the proximal femur and the use of plates and screws had the highest infections for both superficial and deep infections.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The incidence of HWR-related complications is low (7.6%). Given HWR is often left to surgeon discretion without evidence-based decision making, these results can help surgeons and families to make evidence-based decisions on whether or not to remove hardware.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Help surgeons determine whether HWR is appropriate, especially in the elective setting, given the risks and benefits found in this cohort.</p>

        <p>LOE-Prognostic-Level II</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Surgical treatment of congenital muscular torticollis (CMT) has demonstrated clinical efficacy in cases unresponsive to conservative therapies. Nevertheless, there is a paucity of reports on self-reported outcomes and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). This study aims to assess HRQoL in children, adolescents, and young adults undergoing surgical treatment for CMT, comparing HRQoL with clinical outcomes.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> We conducted a Level 2 prospective observational study on a cohort of CMT patients treated surgically at a single tertiary center. Surgical intervention was guided by clinical indicators, including sternocleidomastoid (SCM) tightness, pain, restricted neck motion, craniofacial asymmetry, and insufficient response to physical therapy. The surgical procedures focused on complete release of tightness, with routine elongation of the medial head to preserve cosmetic function. Patients underwent rigorous pre-operative and post-operative assessments, followed by long-term follow-up. A strict postoperative protocol, including stretching, physiotherapy, and positional exercises, was followed for a minimum of 6&#x2009;months. Clinical outcomes were assessed using the Cheng and Tang torticollis scoring system, while HRQoL was evaluated using the PedsQL&#x2122; 4.0 generic core scales.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> The study comprised 31 patients with an average age of 11.4&#x2009;years. Significant improvements in range of motion, deformities, and overall subjective satisfaction were observed at the 2-year follow-up. The Cheng and Tang score improved significantly from fair (9.6 points) to excellent (17.9 points) after 2&#x2009;years (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Older patients exhibited less improvement than their younger counterparts, particularly in terms of craniofacial asymmetry (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.004). Patient PedsQL scores also significantly improved at the 2-year mark (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.040), with no discernible age-related differences.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This study demonstrates that surgical treatment significantly enhances PedsQL scores in children, adolescents, and young adults with CMT. Notably, clinical parameters such as shoulder, neck, and plagiofacial deformities showed significant improvement, particularly in younger patients. Utilizing the Cheng and Tang system, all patients achieved good or excellent outcomes, suggesting a correlation between improved clinical results and higher HRQoL post-CMT surgery. Importantly, PedsQL scores detected surgical changes, underscoring their sensitivity. Our findings underscore substantial HRQoL and clinical improvements following CMT surgery, with age-related differences, particularly in craniofacial asymmetry improvement. We recommend further research, including the development of a specific CMT HRQoL questionnaire.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This study contributes to our understanding of the effectiveness of surgical treatment for CMT and its impact on the quality of life of affected individuals. It provides valuable insights for healthcare professionals and researchers in this field.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) develops in 1%&#x2013;3% of adolescents, with recent trends demonstrating increased rates of posterior spinal fusion (PSF). Advances in intraoperative computed tomography (iCT), navigation, and robotics suggest improved outcomes and safer instrumentation. However, imaging techniques expose children to varying yet often significant amounts of ionizing radiation. Furthermore, scoliosis patients accumulate exposure due to recurrent surveillance imaging. Despite the well-established dose-dependent relationship of radiation and oncogenesis, minimal data exist on the true oncological risks of advanced operative spine imaging in children. Our goal was to compare the lifetime cancer risk of iCT-navigation compared to traditional imaging techniques (non-iCT) in AIS PSF.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Retrospective analysis of AIS patients (0&#x2013;18&#x2009;years) treated with PSF at a quaternary pediatric center was performed (2014&#x2013;2019). Demographic, surgical, deformity, and radiation characteristics were compared between groups based on intraoperative imaging technique (iCT versus non-iCT). Cumulative radiation exposure and carcinogenesis risk were calculated as total effective dose (ED) in millisieverts (mSv) based on established conversion factors utilizing age, gender, and body region. Pediatric low-dose iCT protocols were used.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 245 patients (mean&#x2009;=&#x2009;14.4&#x2009;years; 83% female) were included: 119 iCT (49%) were compared to 126 non-iCT (51%) (Table 1). After accounting for clinical/radiographic variations, radiation exposure was statistically different between imaging groups, with iCT patients receiving the highest degree of ionization (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Total ED (median; interquartile range (IQR)) per group included fluoroscopy (0.05&#x2009;mSv; 0.03&#x2013;0.07), fluoroscopy/radiography (4.14&#x2009;mSv; 0.23&#x2013;4.4), and iCT group (8.19&#x2009;mSv; 5.36&#x2013;11.7). Overall, iCT-navigated PSF theoretically resulted in 0.9 iatrogenic malignancies per 1000 patients (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001; IQR, 0.59&#x2013;1.29), while 2.37/1000 patients (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001; IQR, 1.47&#x2013;3.27) are projected to develop in patients with 3 iCT spins/acquisitions.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Compared to traditional non-iCT PSF, an additional 1/1000 AIS patients are expected to develop cancer directly related to iCT usage. In addition, the true incidence of carcinogenesis after a complete treatment course is likely underestimated due to cumulative radiation exposure from surveillance imaging. Further research is necessary to evaluate long-term population risks of iatrogenic imaging-induced malignancies.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Advanced operative imaging modalities are being increasingly applied in spine surgery. Despite rising trends in iCT, a paucity of data exists on the potential risks of neoplastic transformation secondary to iatrogenic, imaging-induced radiation exposure. We found an alarming incidence of anticipated cancers due to iCT which exposes patients to significantly higher ED compared to alternative techniques. The dose-dependent risk of cancer necessitates limited radiation exposure in developing children and a discussion of iCT indications/regulations is required to promote development of radiation-free imaging modalities in the biomedical sector.</p>

        <p>LOE-Diagnostic-Level II</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Pediatric patients are sensitive to the effects of radiation. There are no established standard protocols or society guidelines supporting the use of radiation shielding during bedside orthopedic procedures requiring fluoroscopic guidance despite frequent use. Consequently, there is a wide variation among institutions. Some position papers have suggested that radiation shields may actually increase radiation exposure to the patient due to scatter of the X-ray beams. In this study, we sought to quantify the amount of radiation at three critical anatomic locations using a mannequin model undergoing a simulated bedside upper extremity fracture reduction with and without lead shielding.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A mannequin (Laerdal Medical) approximating the size of an average 5-year-old was placed supine on a standard hospital stretcher. The upper extremity was extended over the image intensifier of a standard fluoroscopy machine (GE Healthcare). Exposures were performed at 110&#x2009;kVp and 4.5&#x2009;mA for 10&#x2009;s. A dosimeter (Mirion Technologies) was used to assess scattered radiation in three locations: neck/thyroid, chest/breast, and groin. Readings were assessed with and without a standard rectangular radiation shield that spanned from the chin to the upper thighs. Each configuration was replicated five times.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> With no shielding, the neck/thyroid received 61.5&#x2009;mSv, breast/chest received 58.2&#x2009;mSv, and the groin received 39.7&#x2009;mSv. These values were significantly higher (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001) compared to the values measured at the thyroid, chest, and groin when in the presence of an anterior shield (4.1, 5.3, and 1.2&#x2009;mSv, respectively) or in the presence of an anterior and posterior shield (1.4, 4.7, and 1.8&#x2009;mSv, respectively.) There was no statistical difference between anterior shielding and anterior and posterior shielding in all three locations.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Radiation shields placed anteriorly over a pediatric patient significantly reduce the radiation exposure of pediatric patients in the neck/thyroid, chest/breast, and groin regions by an average of 20-fold. The use of a posterior shield confers no additional protection.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Although fluoroscopy is commonly used in pediatric orthopedic procedures, there remains no standard guideline for the use of radiation shielding, leading to wide variation in clinical practice. This study not only offers the first of its kind data supporting the use of anterior radiation shielding during reduction procedures where the radiation source is above the patient but also suggests that additional shielding techniques may need to be considered to reduce the exposure even further. Providers should strongly consider placing an anterior shield on the patient when performing a bedside procedure requiring fluoroscopy.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Suicide is the second leading cause of death among American children aged 10&#x2013;18&#x2009;years, and those with physical health conditions have a 20% increase in suicidal ideation (SI) relative to their healthy peers. Despite this, suicidality in children with musculoskeletal problems is largely unstudied. This study therefore aims to determine the prevalence of SI in pediatric orthopedic patients and identify risk factors for endorsement of suicidality.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective review of all patients aged 10&#x2009;years and older presenting for outpatient orthopedic evaluation to a single tertiary pediatric orthopedic institution over a 1-year period was conducted. Demographic information, chief complaint, pain symptomatology, treatment history, primary orthopedic diagnosis, and responses on the Ask Suicide Screening Questionnaire were compared between patients who endorsed suicidality and those that did not.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Of 11,590 individual patient encounters, 201 children (2.0%) endorsed SI with 9 (4.3%) experiencing active and imminent suicidal thoughts. Patients endorsing suicidality were predominantly female (67%), Caucasian (75%), and had a mean age of 14.3&#x2009;years. Patients who endorsed SI were significantly more likely to present with a chief complaint of pain (46.4% versus 33.3%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.00008) and ultimately more likely to receive non-structural, non-mechanical pain diagnosis (23.7% versus 16.9%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.010). Those presenting for pain who screened positive for SI were more likely to characterize their pain as persistent or chronic (81.6%), which trended toward but did not reach statistical significance (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.05). Adjusting for age and sex, multivariate analysis showed that patients taking a psychotropic medication (odds ratio (OR)&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.45, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.51&#x2013;3.84) and carrying a documented preexisting mental health diagnosis (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;3.95, 95% CI: 2.85&#x2013;5.43) were more likely to report SI. Moreover, patients with an underlying mental health disorder presenting with a chief complaint of pain without an identifiable structural or mechanical etiology were 12 times more likely to screen positive for SI (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;12.1, 95% CI: 6.36&#x2013;22.83).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> SI is not uncommon among adolescent pediatric orthopedic patients presenting for outpatient care. White females with chronic pain complaints and an existing diagnosis of a mental health disorder appear to be at particularly high risk.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This is the first comprehensive study to assess SI in a large, outpatient, pediatric orthopedic population over this period. These data suggest that mental health screening and the provision of integrated clinical care with psychologists and other behavioral health specialists may be important to provide comprehensive care to adolescent orthopedic patients.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) applications such as ChatGPT are increasingly being utilized to interpret, summarize, and deliver information across many disciplines. It is imperative that we understand the ability and limitations of GenAI within healthcare. The aim of this study was to assess the level and accuracy of ChatGPT in communicating information about pediatric orthopedic procedures to patients and families.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> We prompted ChatGPT to explain the indications, risks, benefits, and alternatives to five common surgeries: closed reduction percutaneous pinning for supracondylar humerus fractures, flexible intramedullary nailing for femoral shaft fractures, posterior spinal fusion for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, open hip reduction for developmental hip dysplasia, and physeal-sparing anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. The unedited responses were distributed to practicing pediatric orthopedists across four academic institutions. Surgeons were asked to rate the author&#x2019;s level of experience, assess the accuracy and completeness of the information, and determine whether it was sufficient to provide education to families without modification. Respondents were blinded to the fact that the information was written by GenAI.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> There were 18 respondents from 4 institutions, with the majority (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;15; 83%) having &#x2265;11&#x2009;years of experience. Respondents most attributed the level at which the information was written to that of a fellow (32%) (Figure 1A). However, 35% of respondents felt the information was written by an author at either the junior or senior attending level. There were no differences in perceived level of experience by subsections (indications, risks, benefits, alternatives) (Figure 1B). Overall, respondents felt that the medical information provided was accurate and complete (Figure 1C), with 63% of total explanations receiving a score&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;4/5. Across all subsections, 50% of respondents felt the explanations were sufficient to provide education to families without modification (Figure 1D). When answering questions concordant with their own self-selected subspecialty, respondents were equally likely to grade the explanations as accurate and complete (60% with a score&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;4/5), but less likely to feel they were sufficient for family consumption without modification (43%).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> ChatGPT can provide high-level information about common pediatric orthopedic procedures. However, while most respondents felt the information was accurate and complete, only half felt the information was sufficient to provide education to families without modification.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> As GenAI applications such as ChatGPT become increasingly available, families will utilize them more often to obtain medical information. This study is the first to evaluate the ability of GenAI to communicate accurate information about pediatric orthopedic surgery to patients.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Medical training occurs during optimal childbearing years. While unique family planning challenges for surgeons are becoming more widely reported, a gap in knowledge remains regarding fertility and pregnancy risks for each subspecialty. Establishing contemporary trends of infertility risks and pregnancy barriers specific to orthopedic surgeons is imperative to defining steps to improve maternal support at all levels of training and practice. The goal of this study was to determine the prevalence of pregnancy complications, infertility, and maternal support for female orthopedic surgeons in comparison to the general population and other female physicians.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> An anonymous, voluntary survey was distributed to female physicians via private physician social media groups from June to August 2021. The survey queried pregnancy demographics and complications, infertility diagnosis and treatment, workplace environment, and prior education on these topics. Results were compared between orthopedic surgeons and the general population using data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as well as between orthopedic surgeons and other female physicians. Statistical analysis was performed using Fisher&#x2019;s exact test, chi-square with Yates&#x2019; correction, or Student&#x2019;s t-tests as indicated.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 4638 female physicians completed the survey, including 141 (3%) orthopedic surgeons. Compared with the general population, orthopedic surgeons had children later in life (34.1 versus 23.6&#x2009;years; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001), were more likely to have had a miscarriage (40% versus 19.1%; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001), to have undergone infertility evaluation (40.1% versus 8.8%; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001) or infertility treatment (31.9% versus 12.7%; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001), and to have had a pre-term birth (19.9% versus 10.2%; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001). Forty-six percent of orthopedic surgeons reported a pregnancy complication and only 6% received education on risks of delaying pregnancy. Compared to other physicians, orthopedic surgeons were older at first pregnancy (34.1 versus 31.7, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001), had fewer children (1.8 versus 2.0, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0094), were more often discouraged from starting a family during training and practice (56% versus 42%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0007), and worked significantly more hours per week while pregnant (59.1 versus 54.1, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0002; Table 1).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Female orthopedic surgeons have increased risk of miscarriage, infertility, and preterm birth compared to the general population. In addition, orthopedic surgeons experience more negative workplace attitudes and longer working hours while pregnant compared to physician peers.

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> This study assesses scar healing over a 24-month period following syndactyly release surgery using full-thickness autograft (FTSG) versus hyaluronic acid (HA) matrix skin graft substitute. We hypothesized that scar healing would be non-inferior for HA compared with FTSG.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A randomized, single-blinded, within-subject controlled study was used to compare the effectiveness of HA versus FTSG for 40 webs in 18 patients (aged 1.2&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;0.8&#x2009;years) undergoing syndactyly release. HA was used on one side of the web and FTSG was used on the other side of the web in each case. At 12- and 24- month post-surgery scar healing was assessed using Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS), Vancouver Scar Score (VSS), Web Creep, and the family and surgeon&#x2019;s preferred scar (FTSG, HA, or equivalent). FTSG source was groin (12 webs) and antecubital fossa (28 webs).</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Families rated the syndactyly scar with lower/better scores for FTSG compared to HA at the 12- and 24-month visits. Surgeons&#x2019; VSS scores showed preference for FTSG in thickness and vascularity without clear superiority. At the final 24-month visit, FTSG and HA were preferred equally by 42% of families with 16% of families rating HA and FTSG as equivalent; HA was the preferred scar in 46%, FTSG preferred in 31%, and equivalent in 23% according to surgeons. Major complications (CD Level III) occurred in three patients (17%) and included infection, graft failure, and scar revision with return to the OR during the study period.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Neither HA nor FTSG demonstrated superiority as defect coverage for syndactyly release surgery at final follow-up. When compared with FTSG, HA provides diminished surgical time and no donor-site morbidity; however, HA has an open wound for a longer period postoperatively, with greater wound care requirements by families to ensure appropriate wound healing.</p>

</p>
        <p>LOE-Therapeutic-Level II</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Recent evidence has demonstrated equivalent or superior outcomes following conservative treatment of completely displaced midshaft clavicle fractures in adolescents. However, specific sub-populations, such as throwers, who may have unique relative benefits from surgical intervention, remain under-investigated. The current study therefore assessed complications and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in baseball players and other overhead athletes, with specific comparisons of dominant versus non-dominant shoulders and operative versus non-operative treatment.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Ten 18-year-old patients with completely displaced midshaft clavicle fractures treated at eight participating institutions from 2013 to 2022 were filtered for those who self-reported participation in baseball, softball, racquet sports, water polo, lacrosse, and football quarterbacks. Athletes were divided into operative (open reduction internal fixation (ORIF)) or nonoperative (NonOp) treatment cohorts and sub-divided into dominant versus non-dominant injured laterality. Demographics, fracture characteristics, outcomes, complications, and PROs (ASES, QuickDASH, Marx Shoulder Activity, EQ5D, EQVAS) were analyzed for patients with a minimum of 1-year follow-up.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Out of a total of 788 adolescents with completely displaced clavicle fractures, 238 overhead athletes (30.2%) included 123 baseball players (51.7%, 15.6% overall), fewer of which were the dominant (46, 37.4%) versus non-dominant shoulder (77, 62.6%). Of the 46 dominant baseball player sub-population, 18 (39.1%) were in the ORIF cohort, compared to 28 (60.9%) in the NonOp cohort. When complications, secondary surgeries, or PROs were compared, the only difference was a superior mean QuickDASH score in the NonOp cohort (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01), a finding that was replicated when treatment groups in the dominant shoulder of all overhead athletes were compared as well (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.04). When dominant versus non-dominant shoulders were analyzed among baseball players, both within ORIF and NonOp cohorts, there were no differences in complications, secondary surgeries, or PROs between sides. Complications in the dominant side of all overhead athletes were rare, including delayed union (2%), symptomatic malunion (1%), and refracture (4%), and were not statistically different between ORIF and Nonop cohorts. Only one case of nonunion (on the non-dominant side of a baseball player) was identified, despite most patients (77%) undergoing non-operative treatment.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Overhead throwers, including baseball players, who sustained completely displaced midshaft clavicle fractures appear to have equivalent, or perhaps superior results from non-operative treatment, when compared to surgical fixation. Outcomes appear similar between the dominant and non-dominant side, regardless of treatment approach.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Unlike completely displaced midshaft clavicle fractures in adult patients, similar fractures in adolescent overhead athletes are associated with low rates of complications, such as non-union and symptomatic malunion, regardless of treatment approach.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> The purpose of this study was to compare patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and graft rupture in a multicenter prospective cohort study of skeletally immature patients who underwent anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) using growth preservation techniques. The hypothesis was that PROs across sub-cohorts would be similar, but anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) graft rupture rates would be higher in the early adolescent/pubescent group than in the pediatric/pre-pubescent group.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Skeletally immature patients who underwent ACLR by one of 23 PLUTO surgeon-investigators at one of 10 participating academic medical centers across the United States over a 5-year period (2016&#x2013;2020) were included. Surgical techniques were categorized as one of three different pediatric/prepubescent physeal-sparing techniques (all-epiphyseal, AE; partial transphyseal, PTP; combined intra-articular/extra-articular, extraphyseal using ilitiobial band, ITB) or an early adolescent/pubescent transphyseal (TP) physeal-respecting technique, and by autograft type (hamstring, HS; soft tissue quadriceps, Q; iliotibial band, ITB). Demographics, surgical characteristics, pedi-IKDC scores, and ACL graft rupture (re-tear) rates were analyzed with comparative statistics.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 742 patients (mean age: 12.9&#x2009;years (SD, 1.9), 62% male) were included. Two-year follow-up pedi-IKDC was available in 553 (74%) patients at a median 24 (interquartile range (IQR), 24.0&#x2013;26.7) months post-ACLR. The median pedi-IKDC score for the full cohort at 2-year follow-up was 94.6 (range, 21.7&#x2013;98.9). Median pedi-IKDC was not found to be different across surgical technique groups (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.22, Figure 1) or graft types (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.51) at 2-year follow-up. Of 665 (665/742, 90%) patients with adequate 2-year re-tear data, 48 (7%) experienced a re-tear at a median 16&#x2009;months post-operatively (IQR, 10&#x2013;22&#x2009;months). Significant differences were detected in re-tear across surgical techniques (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.008), with pairwise comparisons revealing higher re-tear in TP (10%) than ITB (3%; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02). No differences were otherwise detected in re-tear across graft types (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.12). The rates of re-tear were significantly higher in the pubescent group (10%) than in the prepubescent group (3%; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Among skeletally immature patients undergoing ACLR, pre-pubescent children undergoing physeal-sparing techniques have superior 2-year re-tear rates than pubescent adolescents undergoing transphyseal techniques. The physeal-sparing ITB technique has superior re-tear rates compared to the transphyseal technique, but similar outcomes to other pediatric physeal-sparing (PTP, AE) techniques.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> The frequency of ACLR is increasing at a faster rate in pediatric patients than in any other sub-population. There remains a dearth of prospective comparative studies designed to elucidate the optimal techniques for this active, high-risk sub-population.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Repair of large osteochondral (OC) defects represents a significant challenge in pediatric orthopedics and often leads to progressive and early osteoarthritis. Current treatments for large OC defects are limited in their clinical success by the defect size and geometry of the recipient, donor tissue availability, and inferior mechanical properties. Differences in structure, architecture, metabolic activity, timing of bone and cartilage regeneration, and the differing moduli of cartilage and subchondral bone require a comprehensive strategy to regenerate OC tissue. Thus, this study aimed to assess the integration of a novel, biomimetic scaffold, and its concomitant regeneration of OC tissue 6&#x2009;months after treatment of an OC defect. Our hypothesis was that the regenerated OC tissue would be comparable to OATS autograft.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> The study was approved by the IACUC (IACUC2020-0081). Regeneration of OC tissue within a distal femoral OC defect was studied in an adolescent porcine model (Yucatan minipig) after implantation of a novel, biomimetic scaffold. Polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffolds containing thermally stable polylactic acid (PLA) microspheres encapsulating bioinductive, decellularized cartilage or bone matrix were three-dimensional (3D) printed in a biphasic fashion (DCM+ scaffold). The PLA microspheres containing bone DCM were printed in the &#x201C;subchondral layer&#x201D; and PLA microspheres containing cartilage DCM within the &#x201C;cartilage layer&#x201D; of the scaffolds, mimicking the hierarchical micro-architecture of OC tissue. To assess and compare OC regeneration and integration, PCL scaffolds containing PLA microspheres without DCM (DCM&#x2212;) and OATS autografts were included as negative and positive controls, respectively. Six months after implantation, OC regeneration was assessed by micro-computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and biochemical assays.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Six-month implants showed higher percentage of new bone formation in the outer annulus bone of DCM+ scaffolds as compared to DCM&#x2212; and OATS (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05) indicating excellent integration of the DCM+ scaffolds within host tissue (Figure 1). Two-dimensional (2D) Magnetic Resonance Observation of Cartilage Repair Tissue (MOCART) score by MRI study showed new OC regeneration in DCM+ scaffolds comparable to OATS autografts (Figure 2). Histologic staining showed excellent OC regeneration within the DCM+ scaffolds at least comparable to OATS (Figures 3 and 4).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The biomimetic 3D-printed scaffolds exhibited excellent OC regeneration and scaffold integration at 6&#x2009;months. The tidemark layer was also maintained. Scoring by histology and MRI was comparable to OATS.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Biomimetic 3D-printed scaffolds recapitulate normal OC tissue architecture at 6&#x2009;months post-implantation providing evidence for their further development as an alternative to current treatment strategies for large OC defects in pediatric, adolescent, and young adult patients.</p>

</p>
        <p>LOE-Prognostic-Level III</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> In Perthes disease, there is an increased risk of osteoarthritis later in life and thus long-term studies are necessary to analyze the outcome. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of total hip arthroplasty (THA) after Perthes disease and to define risk factors for poor outcome.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Patients were recruited from a search of the radiographic archive at our hospital. Inclusion criteria were patients with nonoperative treatment for Perthes disease and a minimum of 25-year follow-up. The femoral head at the healing stage was classified with the modified Stulberg method (a 3-group classification based on the shape of the femoral head: spherical, ovoid, or flat). Information regarding THA was provided by the Norwegian Arthroplasty Register. Kaplan&#x2013;Meier survival analysis with conversion to THA as the endpoint was used to find the percentage of hips that had not undergone THA.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 229 patients (244 hips) were included in the study, 184 boys and 45 girls. The mean age at diagnosis was 6.2&#x2009;years (2.1&#x2013;13.7&#x2009;years). Treatment was nonoperative with relief of weight-bearing and/or abduction orthosis. At the healing stage, 105 hips (43%) were classified as spherical, 93 (38%) as ovoid, and 46 (19%) as flat. The mean time from diagnosis to follow-up was 48&#x2009;years (27&#x2013;72&#x2009;years). At follow-up, 47 hips (19%) had undergone THA at a mean patient age of 46&#x2009;years (22&#x2013;72&#x2009;years). Age&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;6&#x2009;years at diagnosis was associated with significantly worse outcome compared with that of age&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;6&#x2009;years; the rate of THA in the two groups were 28% and 10%, respectively (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). The frequency of THA was 3% in hips with spherical femoral heads, 25% in hips with ovoid heads, and 46% in hips with flat heads (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Survival analysis showed a mean survival rate of 100% in spherical hips, 99% in ovoid hips, and 98% in flat hips at 20-year follow-up and 99%, 76%, and 48%, respectively, at 50-year follow-up.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> After a mean follow-up of 48&#x2009;years, 19% of non-operatively treated hips with Perthes disease had undergone THA. The negative prognostic factors were age&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;6&#x2009;years at diagnosis and deformed (especially flat) femoral head at skeletal maturity.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> The study demonstrates the long-term outcome of non-operatively treated Perthes disease, which should represent a valuable basis for comparison with other treatment methods.</p>

        <p>LOE-Therapeutic-Level IV</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> The elevated long-term risk for arthrosis after treatment of slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) has been described. Previous studies have observed the need for later total hip replacement (THR) to range from 12% to 24% during a mean follow-up varying between 16 and 38&#x2009;years. It is possible that the incidence increases with the patients age due to progression of degenerative changes. To our knowledge, no study has described the risk for THR in a more than 40-year follow-up.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> In this study, 138 patients with 172 affected hips treated with in situ fixation were evaluated retrospectively. Ninety-seven patients (70%) were male (mean age 14.0&#x2009;years for males and 12.7&#x2009;years for females at surgery) and 35 patients (25%) had a bilateral disease. The median follow-up time was 49&#x2009;years (range, 37&#x2013;64&#x2009;years). Basic demographics, stability, and surgical details were obtained from patient records, preoperative radiographs (slip angle) were measured, and data on THR was gathered from the National Arthroplasty Register.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> The preoperative slip angle averaged 39&#xB0; (SD, 19&#xB0;). After a median follow-up of 49&#x2009;years, 56 (41%) patients had undergone THR of a hip previously fixed in situ for SCFE and 64 (37%) of all affected hips had been replaced. Kaplan&#x2013;Meier analysis gave a median prosthesis-free postoperative survival of 55&#x2009;years (95% confidence interval, (CI)&#x2009;=&#x2009;45&#x2013;64&#x2009;years) for the affected hips. In a multivariate analysis, females had a twofold (hazard ratio (HR)&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.42, 95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.16&#x2013;5.07) risk for THR and a greater preoperative slip angle (HR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.03 for every increment of 1&#xB0;, 95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.01&#x2013;1.05) increased the risk for replacement surgery while patient age at surgery, slip laterality, stability of slip, or diagnostic delay did not have a statistically significant effect on risk of THR.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> SCFE treated primarily with in situ fixation may lead to THR in more than 40% of the affected hips, when follow-up reaches 50&#x2009;years. This risk is approximately 15 times the reported life-time risk in our general population. Female sex and increasing preoperative slip angle significantly predicted higher risk of total hip replacement.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> With a median follow-up time of 49&#x2009;years, our study group of 138 patients represents one of the largest patient series with very long-term follow-up data.</p>

</p>
        <p>LOE-Therapeutic-Level III</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Vertebral body tethering (VBT) is a new, non-fusion alternative for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. To date, there are only several published outcome studies with no more than 2&#x2009;years of postoperative follow-up and almost no outcome data beyond 2&#x2009;years. We aimed to fill this gap in the VBT literature by evaluating mid-term outcomes in our first 31 consecutive patients. We hypothesized that (1) the postoperative success would decrease, (2) the surgical revision and suspected broken tether rate would increase, and (3) additional patients would convert to a posterior spinal fusion (PSF).</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> We retrospectively assessed additional clinical and radiographic data (mean follow-up: 5.7&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;0.7) from the original 31 consecutive VBT patients previously included in Hoernschemeyer et al. (2020). This cohort included patients with various curve patterns (e.g. thoracolumbar only, bilateral). Radiographic measurements included standard deformity measures and skeletal maturity status at latest follow-up. Using the same definition of success (i.e. cobb&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;30&#xB0;; no PSF), we revisited the success rate, revision rate, broken tether rate, and conversion to PSF. To assess differences between the values presented in Hoernschemeyer et al. and those derived from additional follow-up, we performed a two-sided t-test with an alpha of &#x2264;0.05 indicating statistical significance.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Of our first 31 patients treated with VBT, 29 patients returned for additional follow-up after publication. At 5&#x2009;years, the success rate dropped to 64% as deformity measures increased and the revision rate increased to 28% following two additional surgical revisions. Four additional suspected broken tethers were identified for a rate of 55%, with only one occurring beyond 4&#x2009;years. Ninety-three percent of this cohort continues to avoid PSF. We observed an average cobb increase of 4&#xB0; and 8&#xB0; in the thoracic and lumbar spine, respectively. Statistically significant progression of both thoracic (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) and lumbar curves (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.047) were seen only in Lenke 1B/1C patients where we tethered only the main thoracic curve.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> With more than 5&#x2009;years of follow-up on our VBT cohort, we observed: (1) a decrease in the postoperative success rate due to deformity progression in most subgroups and (2) an increase in the revision and suspected broken tether rate. No additional patients received a PSF.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> With more than 5&#x2009;years of follow-up, 93% of VBT patients continue to avoid a PSF and 89% exhibited deformities that are &#x2264;40&#xB0;, which may indicate long-term survivorship.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), a heterogeneous type 1 collagenopathy, results in fragile bones. Bisphosphonates reduce fractures and are used to manage moderate-to-severe OI in children. C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) is produced in the growth plate and positively regulates linear bone growth. This study aims to evaluate whether the addition of CNP analog to standard bisphosphonate (alendronate (ALN)) therapy will reduce fracture incidence, improve growth, increase bone mineral density (BMD), and/or improve bone strength in the growing oim/oim mouse.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> At 2&#x2009;weeks, growing oim/oim mice (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;17) were divided into four groups: control mice (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;8) receiving saline treatment and treated oim/oim (oim) mice receiving weekly ALN along with one of three CNP dosages: 20&#x2009;&#xB5;g/kg 5&#x2009;days/week (20x5) (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;3), 20&#x2009;&#xB5;g/kg 3&#x2009;days/week (20x3) (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;3), or 10&#x2009;&#xB5;g/kg 3&#x2009;days/week (10x3) (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;3). Faxitron images were taken at 2 and 14&#x2009;weeks (sacrifice) to assess fracture incidence, femoral length, and vertebral height. Microcomputed tomography (micro-CT) was used to assess bone microstructural parameters.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> This IACUC-approved study found that the 20x5 group had no new fractures at sacrifice, while the 20x3 and 10x3 groups each had one fracture, and untreated oim mice had an average of 1.57&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1.33 fractures. All treatment groups showed increased femoral lengths compared to untreated oim mice (Figure 1), with the 20x5 group showing the greatest increase and the 20x3 and 10x3 groups having similar increases. In addition, all treated groups exhibited increased vertebral height; the 20x5 and 10x3 groups had higher vertebral heights than the 20x3 group but were not different from each other. All three dosage groups showed increased cortical bone tissue mineral density (TMD), cortical BMD, cortical bone thickness, trabecular bone volume fraction (BVF), trabecular TMD, trabecular BMD, and trabecular bone number. All three dosage groups had reduced trabecular bone separation (Figure 2). Due to small sample sizes and variability, these differences are reported qualitatively.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Adjuvant CNP analog treatment increased femoral length and vertebral height without compromising fracture reduction and showed added benefits for both trabecular and cortical bone, which was not observed with bisphosphonates alone. Continued enrollment of oim mice will enhance the significance and help determine the optimal dosage for maximizing these positive bone effects.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This research project aims to discern the optimal dose of the CNP analog as a promising adjuvant treatment with ALN therapy to reduce fracture incidence and improve bone growth, quality, and strength in pediatric patients suffering from OI.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> This study aimed to compare the effect of ultrasound-guided bi-lateral and bi-level erector spinae plane block (ESPB) on pain scores, opioid requirements, neuromonitoring parameters, and surgery-induced stress response, compared with standard analgesia following posterior spinal correction and fusion surgery for idiopathic scoliosis in children.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> This was a prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled trial. Sixty patients aged 10&#x2013;18&#x2009;years and with physical status ASA 1 or 2 were randomized into two groups, each receiving either ESPB (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;30) or a sham block (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;30). The primary outcomes were pain scores (Numeric Rating Scale, NRS) within 48&#x2009;h of posterior spinal surgery. The secondary outcomes were total opioid consumption, intraoperative motor-evoked potentials&#x2019; (MEPs) amplitude in &#xB5;V recorded from the tibialis anterior muscle following transcranial magnetic stimulation at the threshold measured in mA, as well as the surgery-induced stress response as expressed by the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) at 12- and 24-h post-operation.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> The ESPB group had lower NRS scores at all time points (30, 60, 90, 120&#x2009;min, and 6, 12, 24, and 48&#x2009;h after surgery), all at p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001, compared with the control group. Total opioid consumption, incidence of nausea and vomiting, and the need for remifentanil or propofol during surgery were significantly lower in the ESPB group. The MEPs showed higher amplitudes and lower stimulus strengths for evoking the threshold responses in the ESPB group. The surgery-induced stress response indicators (NLR and PLR) were significantly lower in the ESPB group.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> ESPB performed in adolescents during idiopathic scoliosis surgery provided more effective analgesia and reduced post-operative opioid requirements. Intra-operatively, ESPB reduced the demand for remifentanil or propofol, thus also reducing the anesthesia influence on MEPs. Post-operatively, ESPB inhibited the stress response as expressed by NLR and PLR ratios.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> The study presents better pain control after spinal correction and fusion surgery for idiopathic scoliosis in children with ultrasound-guided ESPB. Ultrasound-guided ESPB does not affect intraoperative MEP&#x2019;s amplitude.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Local wound infiltration is a non-narcotic method of acute pain management following surgical intervention. This double-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) aimed to determine the impact of wound infiltration with 0.25% bupivacaine with epinephrine, compared to a placebo of equal volume injectable saline, on pain and opioid consumption during the first 24&#x2009;h postoperatively in patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) undergoing posterior spinal fusion (PSF).</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> AIS patients, ages 10&#x2013;17&#x2009;years old, undergoing PSF were randomized to receive intraoperative wound infiltration with 0.25% bupivacaine&#x2009;+&#x2009;epinephrine (treatment) or saline (placebo). Providers, study staff, and patients were blinded to randomization. Postoperatively, patients rated their pain using an 11-point numeric rating scale, 0 to 10. Inpatient pain scores and opioid administration were extracted from medical records. Opioids were converted to morphine milligram equivalents per kilogram (MME/kg). Four 6-h intervals were created to assess average pain scores and total opioids administered during the first 24&#x2009;h. Linear mixed models were used to analyze differences between treatment groups in pain scores and opioid consumption over time.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Fifty-six patients were included (mean age&#x2009;=&#x2009;14.7&#x2009;years, mean body mass index (BMI)&#x2009;=&#x2009;21.5): 26 randomized to the treatment group and 30 to placebo. Patients were predominantly female (75%), White (82%), and non-Hispanic (83%). On average, patients in the treatment group had slightly higher preoperative major Cobb angles compared to the placebo group (63&#xB0; versus 55&#xB0;). Patients in the treatment group consumed significantly less opioids during the first 24&#x2009;h, with the placebo group receiving an average estimated 6 MME/kg more compared to the treatment group (Figure B, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.049). Difference at interval 1 was most notable with a 27.7% reduction, average 36.1 MME/kg (placebo) compared to 26.1 MME/kg (treatment). Opioid consumption decreased significantly over time with interval 4 (18&#x2013;24&#x2009;h) having estimated mean decrease of 13 MME/kg (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) compared to interval 1 (0&#x2013;6&#x2009;h). Despite reduced opioid usage, there was no statistically significant difference in pain scores between treatment groups during the 24-h postoperative period. However, pain scores decreased across time for the entire cohort by approximately 1 point per interval (Figure A, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Local anesthetic injection of 0.25% bupivacaine with epinephrine can effectively decrease postoperative opioid consumption in AIS patients in the first 24&#x2009;h without compromising pain control.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This is the first RCT to assess the impact of wound infiltration on postoperative pain following PSF for AIS. The results suggest the potential of incorporating local wound infiltration as standard practice.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> One in four children with cerebral palsy (CP) will undergo orthopedic surgery during their childhood. Despite its ubiquity, postoperative pain control has been poorly studied in this patient population. Moreover, poor pain management has been associated with adverse surgical outcomes. Multimodal analgesic injections have been well studied in the adult population, demonstrating safety and efficacy at reducing postoperative pain and narcotic consumption, but this modality has not been studied in pediatric patients undergoing similarly complex procedures. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a multimodal surgical site injection for postoperative pain control following operative management of hip dysplasia in patients with CP.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> After obtaining institutional review board (IRB) approval, a multi-center, randomized double-blind placebo control trial was completed. Patients&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;18&#x2009;years old with a diagnosis of CP who were scheduled for varus derotation osteotomy (VDRO) of the proximal femur were randomized to receive a surgical-site injection with either a combination of ropivacaine (3&#x2009;mg/kg), epinephrine (0.5&#x2009;mg), and ketorolac (0.5&#x2009;mg/kg) (experimental group) or normal saline (control). All included patients had identical post-operative care, including immobilization, physical therapy, and standardized, multi-modal postoperative pain control. Pain scores and narcotic consumption were recorded at regular intervals and compared between groups utilizing two-tailed t-test or a non-parametric Mann&#x2013;Whitney test for quantitative variables and a Fisher&#x2019;s exact test for categorical variables.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Thirty-four patients were included, evenly divided between study arms. There were no significant differences in demographic variables, Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS), comorbidities, preoperative radiographic parameters, or concomitant surgeries between groups. Patients in the experimental group required significantly lower narcotic medications at all postoperative time points from post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) until hospital discharge compared to controls (0.41&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;0.42 versus 1.87&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;2.05 total morphine mEQ/kg, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01). Similarly, patients in the experimental group were found to have significantly lower pain scores throughout their hospital stays compared to controls (1.0&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;0.6 versus 2.4&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1.1 mean pain score, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). There were no significant differences in operative time, OR time, blood transfusion requirements, or hospital length of stay between groups. There were no adverse medication reactions or injection site complications in either group.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In patients with CP undergoing hip reconstruction, surgical-site injection with a multimodal analgesic combination improves pain control and reduces narcotic consumption in the early postoperative period with no observed adverse effects.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Local multimodal analgesic injections should be adopted as part of standard multi-modal pain control in this patient population for all osseous surgeries.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Internal lengthening nails have become the preferred method of long bone lengthening. As the experience with these nails increases, it is clear they behave differently than traditional external fixators. For example, radiographically, internal lengthening nail regenerate bone formation is visually quite different than traditional external fixator bone. While the biology and mechanics of regenerate bone formation with external fixators has been extensively studied, very little is known about the same basic science of regenerate bone formation with internal lengthening nails. This study is the first to attempt an evaluation of internal lengthening nail regenerate bone formation while simultaneously attempting to develop the first feasible large animal model.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> After obtaining IACUC approval, nine male goats had successful implantation of a tibial internal lengthening nail. The surgical technique and implants were identical to normal human surgery. After a 6-day latency, the goats were lengthened three times at 0.25&#x2009;mm for a total of 0.75&#x2009;mm per day. Once 2&#x2009;cm of lengthening was completed, the animals entered the consolidation phase with necropsy at 4 or 8&#x2009;weeks. Weekly radiographs during distraction and every 2&#x2009;weeks during consolidation were obtained. Micro-computed tomography (CT) analysis and histology were also performed on each of the specimens.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Although feasible to insert human internal lengthening nails into the goat tibia, the goat anatomy consistently had a deformity apex in the diaphysis. This required the osteotomy site to be more distal than the typical human scenario. The radiographic timeline of regenerate bone formation visually mimicked the human pattern of progressive outside to inside healing. The micro-CT imaging identified a unique characteristic not previously noted in external fixator lengthenings. A fibrous interzone in the center of the regenerate like external fixation was noted, but there was an additional layer of the same tissue on the nail surface within the regenerate bone. This new finding is called the &#x201C;fibrous innerzone&#x201D; (see Figure 1). Histology confirmed healing of the regenerate from the outside to inside with a distinct demarcation between the outer more mature bone and the inner fibro-cartilaginous layer.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This pilot study is the first to demonstrate a feasible large animal model for studying internal lengthening nails. We discovered a unique &#x201C;fibrous innerzone&#x201D; not previously identified in external fixator regenerate bone.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This pilot study confirms that regenerate bone formation and healing appears to occur in a different pattern than external fixator lengthenings and warrants further investigation.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Ca&#xF1;adell&#x2019;s technique consists of a Type I epiphysiolysis performed using continuous distraction (1&#x2009;mm/day) in the last 10&#x2013;12&#x2009;days of neoadjuvant chemotherapy by an external fixator. It is performed, prior to resection, in metaphyseal pediatric bone sarcomas. It was designed to achieve a safe margin due to the ability of the physeal cartilage to be a barrier to tumor spread to the epiphysis, avoiding the need for articular reconstruction, and preserving the growth capacity most of the times.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> We retrospectively reviewed patients who had a metaphyseal pediatric osteosarcoma or Ewing&#x2019;s sarcoma treated at our institution with Ca&#xF1;adell&#x2019;s technique between 1984 and 2021 with a minimum 2-year follow-up. Demographic data, metastases at diagnosis, type of reconstruction, functional results according to the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society scale, infection rate, local recurrence, and overall survival were obtained. All outcome data were collected prospectively and compared to patients in whom the epiphysis could not be preserved.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 169 patients with pediatric metaphyseal sarcomas (100 osteosarcomas and 69 Ewing&#x2019;s sarcomas) were treated in our institution with Ca&#xF1;adell&#x2019;s technique between 1984 and 2021. We found 74% of disease-free survival in osteosarcoma and 68% in Ewing&#x2019;s sarcoma at a mean follow-up of 15&#x2009;years versus 59% in those cases in which the epiphysis could not be preserved (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.03). Also, patients whose epiphyses could not be preserved had more metastases at diagnosis. The global infection rate was 9%, the same as in other tumor operations in which chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy were used. In three cases (1.7%), the distraction occurred unexpectedly through the tumor.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Epiphysiolysis prior to resection of metaphyseal pediatric bone sarcomas provides better clinical outcomes in terms of survival and function than patients in whom the epiphysis could not be preserved.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This study shows the largest series of patients treated with epiphysiolysis prior to resection (Ca&#xF1;adell&#x2019;s technique) of metaphyseal pediatric bone sarcomas during the last 40&#x2009;years.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Differentiating transient synovitis (TS), osteomyelitis (OM), and septic arthritis (SA) in the pediatric population remains a clinical challenge, often resulting in the use of painful, invasive procedures and advanced imaging, which can delay diagnosis and management. The purpose of this study is to develop a serum-based panel of biomarkers and cytokines to accurately diagnose/differentiate TS, OM, and SA at initial presentation.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A prospective study was completed over an 8-year period, collecting serum samples at the initial evaluation at a tertiary care children&#x2019;s hospital in patients with the working diagnosis of a possible musculoskeletal infection. Each sample was analyzed for 103 distinct biomarkers and cytokines using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) testing. Final diagnoses were classified based on clinical scenario, arthrocentesis results, and post-operative synovial fluid cultures. Linear discriminant analysis was performed to identify limited sets of predictive biomarkers and cytokines to accurately diagnose SA, OM, and TS.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 164 pediatric patients whose working diagnosis included a musculoskeletal infection were identified at a single institution over an 8-year period. Average age of SA patients was 5.2&#x2009;years (0&#x2013;11&#x2009;years) with 68% male. Average age of OM patients was 8.1&#x2009;years (0&#x2013;18&#x2009;years) with 59% male. Average age of TS patients was 5.4&#x2009;years (0&#x2013;17&#x2009;years) with 56% male. Twenty-six biomarkers were identified that demonstrated significant differences between SA, OM, and TS. To differentiate SA and TS, a panel of three biomarkers and cytokines was compiled (COMP, TIMP-1, CTACK), which was able to classify 61/69 cases properly (88% accuracy). To differentiate SA and OM, a separate three-panel combination was compiled (COMP, Fractalikine, EGF), which was able to classify 49/64 cases properly (77% accuracy).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The creation of serum-based biomarker/cytokines panels aimed to improve diagnostic accuracy and decrease delays in management in the diagnostic process, in the pediatric population. This study identified two panels of three serum-based biomarkers/cytokines that can accurately differentiate between SA, OM, and TS at initial presentation. Differentiation between TS and SA was 88% accurate, and OM-SA was 77%.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Serum-based biomarker/cytokine panels can differentiate TS-SA with 88% accuracy and SA-OM with 77% accuracy.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Following closed reduction of developmental hip dislocations, residual dysplasia is common with rates of secondary reconstructive surgery approaching 50%&#x2013;60%. The determination and timing of when to proceed with surgery is difficult as acetabular remodeling occurs gradually over the first years following closed reduction. The purpose of this study was to evaluate how age at secondary reconstructive surgery influences the clinical and radiographic outcomes following pelvic osteotomy for residual dysplasia.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Following institutional review board (IRB) approval, we retrospectively reviewed all Salter or Pemberton pelvic osteotomies performed for residual dysplasia following index closed reduction at a single institution between 1983 and 2020. Patients with concurrent femoral osteotomy, femoral head deformity on follow-up radiographs, or patients with &lt;2&#x2009;years radiographic follow-up were excluded. Acetabular index (AI) and migration index (MI) were measured on pre-operative, immediate post-operative, and 2-year follow-up radiographs. Following triradiate cartilage closure, final follow-up (FFU) anterior-posterior pelvis radiographs were measured for lateral center-edge angle (LCEA), T&#xF6;nnis angle, MI, and lateralization ratio (LR). Univariate and multivariate analyses and spearman&#x2019;s correlation coefficients were used to evaluate outcomes based on age at the time of surgery. Significance was set at p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Eighty-four hips from 77 patients were included, including 52 Salter osteotomies (62%) and 32 Pemberton osteotomies (38%), with mean age of surgery 5.19&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1.57&#x2009;years. There was no significant difference in markers of acetabular dysplasia at 2&#x2009;years postop or after triradiate closure between hips treated before or after age 5 (all p&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.05). A higher-than-expected number of patients (41/84, 49%) across both treatment groups demonstrated residual dysplasia at FFU with LCEA&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;25&#x2009;degrees (Figure). However, there was no difference in the rate of residual dysplasia at triradiate closure between hips treated before or after age 5 (48% versus 51%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.19). There was a weak negative linear correlation between age at pelvic osteotomy and FFU LCEA (&#x2212;0.23, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.04) across both treatment groups. However, there was no correlation between age at surgery and T&#xF6;nnis angle, MI, or LR (all p&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.05). In addition, age at the time of surgery was not a significant predictor of LCEA on multivariate analysis (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.16).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> We demonstrated high rates of residual dysplasia at triradiate closure following closed reduction and subsequent pelvic osteotomy. However, the age at secondary reconstructive surgery for residual dysplasia does not significantly influence the radiographic markers of dysplasia at triradiate closure.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> These findings may guide counseling for families and suggest there is no opportunity cost to short-term continued observation while monitoring for acetabular remodeling.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> There is an ongoing debate regarding whether universal ultrasound screening should be used to detect developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) in newborn. The aim of our study was to assess the effectiveness of universal clinical screening complemented with selective ultrasound used in our country.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> In Finland, pediatricians examine all newborns&#x2019; hips in the maternity hospital, and refer infants with suspected DDH to pediatric orthopedic outpatient clinic for a re-examination at 2&#x2009;weeks of age. General practitioners conduct hip examinations on all infants at 4&#x2013;6&#x2009;weeks, at 4&#x2009;months and at 1.5&#x2009;years of age in child welfare clinics and refer the children with suspected DDH expectantly to a pediatric orthopedic service. Hip ultrasound is performed at 8&#x2009;weeks of age to children with suspected or diagnosed DDH. For this retrospective cohort study, we collected the number of children under the age of 15&#x2009;years that were given DDH (ICD-10 codes Q65.0-6) as the major diagnosis in three or more visits. The data were obtained from The Finnish Care Register for Health Care (HILMO), which collects ICD-10 codes of every medical appointment. We calculated the annual incidence per 1000 newborns of a given DDH diagnosis between 2002 and 2021. Late detected DDH was defined as children aged between 6&#x2009;months and 15&#x2009;years at the initial diagnosis who received invasive treatment.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> During the 20-year-long study period, altogether 1,103,269 babies were born (median per year&#x2009;=&#x2009;57,214, range per year&#x2009;=&#x2009;45,346&#x2013;60,694). A total of 6421 children were given DDH as a diagnosis (mean per year&#x2009;=&#x2009;321, range per year&#x2009;=&#x2009;193&#x2013;405), giving a mean calculated incidence of 5.8 per 1000 (95% confidence interval (CI)&#x2009;=&#x2009;5.7&#x2013;6.0) newborns. The female-to-male incidence rate of DDH was 4.4 (95% CI, 4.3&#x2013;4.5). Altogether 120 (0.1 per 1000 newborns (95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.09&#x2013;0.1)) children aged between 6&#x2009;months and 15&#x2009;years were treated for DDH, with little yearly variation (0.04&#x2013;0.2 per 1000 newborns). The incidences of late-detected cases varied between 0.07 and 0.2 per 1000 newborns in the five University Hospital Specific Catchment Areas.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The risk of late diagnosis of DDH leading to invasive treatment was 0.01% in Finland without a universal ultrasound screening program.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Finland&#x2019;s universal clinical DDH screening of neonates complemented with selective ultrasonography is effective, resulting in one of the lowest reported nationwide incidences of late diagnosed DDH globally suggesting that universal ultrasound screening is unnecessary in our country.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Vertebral body tethering (VBT) is used to treat scoliosis in skeletally immature patients. Especially with MIS techniques, screw placement can be challenging, and ramifications of screw malposition are significant. The techniques of intraoperative three-dimensional (3D)-imaging/navigation and fluoroscopic screw placement with confirmatory 3D fluoro spine can possibly reduce the rate of pedicle screw malposition. We compare 3D screw accuracy for anterior VBT screws placed with fluoroscopy/check spin versus computed tomography (CT)-guided navigation.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Retrospective review of the two experienced VBT centers that routinely used either intraoperative CT-guided navigation or fluoroscopic screw insertion followed by check 3D fluoro scan (similar to CT), prior to cord placement, to confirm the screw positions after MIS surgery for VBT. Twenty-two of 133 patients who underwent CT-guided navigation had a postoperative CT scan. Fifty-five patients underwent fluoroscopic-guided screw insertions followed by intraoperative 3D fluoroscopic scan. Images of screws were assessed for appropriate length (no more than 2.5&#x2009;mm short or beyond the far cortex) and appropriate placement within the vertebral body. Screw accuracy and rate of intraoperative screw revision rate were evaluated.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 530 screws had axial imaging available, including 385 fluoroscopically guided screws and 145 CT-navigated screws. The rate of ideal length screws (no more than 2.5&#x2009;mm short or beyond the far cortex) was 125/144 (87%) in navigated group and 356/385 (92%) in the check spin group (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.07), respectively. The mean screw length protruding from the cortex were 0.91&#x2009;mm in navigated group and 0.62&#x2009;mm in fluoroscopic group (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02). Ten out of 380 screws were revised intraoperatively after 3D spinsin, prior to cord placement in the fluoroscopic-guided group while no screw was revised in the navigated group. There were no vascular injuries, neurologic monitoring events, or cerebral spinal fluid leaks in either group.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Both CT navigation and use of a check spin are effective strategies to ensure accurate screw position and length. Fluoroscopic guidance might increase the radiation exposure to the surgeons but gives results while still in the OR, prior to cord placement, so revision of screws is simple and during the initial surgery. It also eliminates the need for an incision for the reference Array.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This is the first study that analyzes the accuracy of navigated and fluoroscopic VBT screws with confirmatory axial imaging. Both fluoroscopy- and CT-guided navigation have high accuracy in VBT surgery that may help lessen the learning curve and improve safety in VBT surgery.</p>

        <p>LOE-Therapeutic-Level III</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> There is variability in clinical outcomes with vertebral body tethering (VBT) partly due to a limited understanding of the growth modulation (GM) response. We used the largest sample of patients with three-dimensional (3D) spine reconstructions to characterize the changes in disk and vertebra morphology that accompany GM during the first 2&#x2009;years following VBT.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A multicenter registry was used to identify adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) patients who underwent VBT with &#x2265;2&#x2009;years of follow-up. Calibrated biplanar X-rays obtained at longitudinal time points (pre-op, post-op, and 2&#x2009;years) underwent 3D reconstruction and subsequent analysis with custom MATLAB software to obtain precision measurements of apical 3 vertebra and 2 disks. GM was defined as change in instrumented Cobb from post-op to 2&#x2009;years. Groupings based on GM magnitude were compared to determine which morphological changes are responsible for the GM response.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Fifty patients (mean age: 12.5&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1.3&#x2009;years) were analyzed over mean 27.7&#x2009;months. GM ranged from 46.9&#xB0; correction to 28.2&#xB0; loss of correction. Improvement in instrumented Cobb from post-op to 2&#x2009;years was positively correlated with concave vertebra height growth (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.57, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), 3D spine length growth (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.36, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.008), and decreased convex disk height (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;&#x2212;0.42, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002). Fifty-four percent of patients were Neutral Modulators (&#x201C;NM&#x201D;; 10&#xB0;&gt;&#x2009;GM&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;&#x2212;10&#xB0;), 36% were High Modulators (&#x201C;+M&#x201D;; GM&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;10&#xB0;), and 10% were Poor Modulators (&#x201C;&#x2212;M&#x201D;; &#x2212;10&#xB0;&gt;&#x2009;GM[LC1]&#xB0;). +M patients experienced an additional 1.6&#x2009;mm (229% increase) of mean concave vertebra growth during study period compared to the &#x2212;M group, (2.3 versus 0.7&#x2009;mm, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.039), while convex vertebra height growth was similar (1.3 versus 1.4&#x2009;mm, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.91, Figure 1).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The mechanism for initial correction and subsequent GM has been further elucidated. If GM occurs, vertebra body heights increase asymmetrically during the GM phase. A strong GM response is correlated with concave vertebral body growth and overall instrumented spine growth. A poor GM response is associated with increase in convex disk height (suspected tether rupture). Future aims will investigate the patient and technique-specific factors which influence increased growth remodeling.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This is the largest such study on the growth modulation phenomenon of VBT using 3D reconstructions. VBT induces vertebra remodeling by fostering concave vertebra growth, not by inhibiting convex vertebra growth as often hypothesized.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Vertebral body tethering (VBT) is a non-fusion option for skeletally immature patients with idiopathic scoliosis. As with posterior spinal fusion (PSF), compensatory curves are not commonly included in the construct. Prior studies demonstrated spontaneous correction of the compensatory thoracic curve after selective lumbar fusion, which can guide decision making of instrumented levels. However, no prior studies have examined thoracic curve correction after lumbar VBT. We hypothesize a smaller spontaneous correction of the unoperated thoracic curve from lumbar VBT compared to lumbar fusion because of decreased three-dimensional (3D) correction with VBT.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Retrospectively compared prospectively collected multicenter cohort study.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Twenty-four VBT and 24 fusion patients were matched 1:1 for upper instrumented vertebra (UIV; T8-11), lowest instrumented vertebra (LIV; L2-3), and thoracic Cobb with no differences between pre-operative thoracic or lumbar curves. Fusion patients were 1.4&#x2009;years older (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.008). There were no significant differences between VBT and PSF for average pre-op or 2&#x2009;years post-op major T or L curves, T1 tilt, or coronal balance. VBT had 4&#xB0; less PJK and 10&#xB0; less L lordosis at 2&#x2009;years; PSF had 12&#x2009;mm better coronal balance (Table 1). Thoracic curves worsened an insignificant amount from first erect to 2&#x2009;years (2&#xB0; in VBT, &lt;1&#xB0; in PSF). Compared to pre-operative flexibility radiographs, 2-year post-op thoracic curves were 6.2&#xB0; (VBT) and 7.0&#xB0; (PSF) larger (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.83). There were 7 (24%) reoperations in the VBT group: 2 overcorrections relaxed, 2T adding-on (extended to T by PSF-1, VBT-1), 1 broken tether converted to PSF, and 1 (4%) reoperation in the fusion group (pseudarthrosis/broken screw). No other major complications.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Spontaneous thoracic correction is achieved to a similar degree for lumbar VBT and PSF patients operatively treated for their lumbar curves. There is little change in thoracic curve magnitude over time, and, on average, the correction does not reach the pre-operative flexibility curve measurement. There is a higher rate of revision in VBT patients to achieve these outcomes.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> The uninstrumented thoracic curve spontaneously corrects to a similar degree in either tethered or fused lumbar spines, but to less than on the pre-operative flexibility imaging. This should be considered when deciding on whether to include the thoracic curve in a main lumbar VBT or PSF.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) first approved vertebral body tethering (VBT) for AIS in August 2019. Published data thus far are from cohorts treated prior to approval 9/2019 with off-label products (first-generation data (1G)). We sought to evaluate second-generation outcomes (2G) from three experienced centers using a consecutive series of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) patients, within FDA indications, treated with VBT for AIS. We hypothesized that 2G results would be superior to 1G due to the use of an on-label device and instrumentation and experience at these centers.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Multicenter retrospective review of perioperative and postoperative outcomes following VBT. Patient series were consecutive and from three experienced centers. Inclusion criteria were curves between 35 and 65&#x2009;degrees, skeletally immature patients, and minimum follow-up (fu) of 2&#x2009;years.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 92 subjects with 104 treated curves were included. Mean initial Cobb 52 (38&#x2013;65) with mean fu 28&#x2009;months (21&#x2013;43). Mean coronal Cobb angles for the first post op visit (FV), 1- and 2-year time points were 26 (9&#x2013;46), 21 (0&#x2013;41), and 24 (3&#x2013;49). Thirty-three patients&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;3-year fu with a mean Cobb of 26 (1&#x2013;40). At most recent fu 88%&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;35&#x2009;degrees. There was 1 fusion (1%) and 9 additional interventions 10%, including 4 reoperations for overcorrection, 4 surgeries for instrumentation complications, and 1 aspiration for pulmonary effusion. The overall additional intervention rate was 11%. Tether rupture 27%. There were 0 neurologic injuries or infections.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> For this series of 92 AIS patients treated with an FDA-approved VBT, 2- to 4-year post op outcomes were improved with only 1% fusion rate and 88% of curves&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;35. Complications occurred in 11% of patients, which included four reoperations for overcorrection. Good correction on first erect radiograph appears to be a predictor for success. Compared to historical series, second-generation data show promising improvements in outcomes and decreasing rate of complications/reoperations to the original first-generation cohorts.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This cohort of 92 patients treated with an FDA-approved VBT for AIS from three experienced centers shows improved outcomes, higher success rates, one fusion, and lower reoperation rates than earlier studies using off-label devices. First erect Cobb is likely a predictor for success. Cord rupture continues to be a concern. Larger cohorts and longer follow-up is critical to fully evaluate VBT for AIS.</p>

        <p>LOE-Therapeutic-Level III</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Although multiple studies have reported tether rupture (TR) rates after anterior vertebral tethering (AVT) as high as 50%, none have adequately analyzed the clinical significance of TR and factors that potentially increase the likelihood of revision surgery. We reviewed 264 consecutive adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) patients after AVT and found 5% with early TR at&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;2&#x2009;years and 18% with late TR at&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;2&#x2009;years. The impact of TR on patients was inconsequential in 62%, consequential in 11%, problematic in 19%, and beneficial in 8%.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Charts, X-rays, and computed tomography (CT) scans were reviewed for TR in 264 consecutive AIS patients treated with AVT for T and TL/L curves 33&#xB0;&#x2013;71&#xB0;. Early TR occurred&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;2&#x2009;years and late TR&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;2&#x2009;years. TR was further categorized as inconsequential (final curve&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;40&#xB0; and no pain), consequential (curve&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;40&#xB0; or pain), problematic (revision required), or beneficial (improvement of overcorrection).</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Of 264 consecutive AIS patients s/p AVT, TR was found in 26 patients with 39 curves (20T/19TL) treated at age 14.6&#x2009;years and R&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.5. Curves with TR corrected from 49.8&#xB0; pre-op to 19.9&#xB0; post-op but lost 8.3&#xB0; of correction with TR at 2.3&#x2009;years settling to 28.2&#xB0; final at 3.3&#x2009;years F/U. Early TR was seen in 9/171 (5%) and late TR in 17/93 (18%) patients with 2&#x2013;10&#x2009;years F/U. TR was inconsequential in 62% (16/26), consequential in 11% (3/26), problematic in 19% (5/26), and beneficial in 8% (2/26). TR occurrence was more common in TL/L curves (73%) and at L2,3 (92%). All TL/L revisions involved tether replacement only whereas thoracic revision required fusion. Revision surgery was unrelated to curve correction or loss of correction but was related to convex back pain (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This study demonstrated an early TR rate of 5% and late TR rate of 18% in a large series of patients treated with AVT for AIS over 13&#x2009;years. While most patients had inconsequential TR (62%), with 8.3&#xB0; loss of correction, a final curve&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;40&#xB0;, and no pain, several patients had consequential (11%) or problematic TR (19%). These adversely affected patients had a final curve&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;40&#xB0;, or pain, or required revision surgery. Fortunately, a small number of patients (8%) benefited from TR by improvement in an area of impending overcorrection.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Although TR is common after AVT for AIS, in this large study, we found 62% were inconsequential (curves&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;40&#xB0; with only 8.3&#xB0; loss of correction and no associated pain). Although 30% of patients had a consequential or problematic TR, 8% were beneficial.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Vertebral body tethering (VBT) is designed to modulate spinal growth without the disadvantages of posterior spinal fusion (PSF). VBT has continued to gain popularity for treatment of idiopathic scoliosis (IS); however, complication and reoperation rates have been reported as high as 25%. The purpose of this study is to determine how complications from VBT effect patient quality of life (QOL) up to 3&#x2009;years after surgery.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> In this retrospective cohort study, all AIS patients who underwent VBT were identified via an analysis of multi-center electronic medical record data from the Pediatric Spine Study Group (PSSG). Patient demographics, surgery dates, complications, Early Onset Scoliosis Questionnaire (EOSQ) scores, and Scoliosis Research Society (SRS) scores were collected. Complications were classified using the modified Clavien-Dindo-Sink (mCDS) system. Analysis of QOL after surgery was determined comparing survey scores of patients with and without any complication over time. Additional analysis was performed comparing patients with no/mild complications (mCDS grade I and II), to those with severe complications (mCDS grade IIIA or above).</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> The study consisted of 339 surveys from 81 patients with EOSQ data and 293 surveys from 101 patients with SRS data. When comparing patients with a complication to those without a complication, patients with complications had significantly lower total EOSQ scores at 2, 2.5, and 3&#x2009;years after surgery (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.009, 0.001, and &lt;0.001); however, there was no difference in total SRS scores at any time point. In comparing patients with severe complications to patients with mild complications/no complication, patients with severe complications had significantly worse total EOSQ at 2, 2.5, and 3&#x2009;years after surgery (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.018, 0.002, and &lt;0.001) and SRS scores at 2, 2.5, and 3&#x2009;years after surgery (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.040, 0.018, 0.010).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Patients with any complication from VBT had worse EOSQ scores at 2&#x2009;years after surgery. Severe complications (mCDS&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;3) following VBT manifest with decreasing EOSQ-24 and SRS-22 scores over time and became statistically significant at 2&#x2009;years and beyond. Long-term follow-up will ascertain whether these poorer QOL outcomes persist at time points greater than 3&#x2009;years. Long-term follow-up will be important following VBT to compare to PSF for improved patient education.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This is the largest cohort of patient-reported outcomes following VBT and the first to study the impact of complications after VBT on HRQOL. The 2-year postoperative time point is an important turning point in quality of life for patients experiencing complications.</p>

        <p>LOE-Therapeutic-Level III</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> The use of an Enhanced Recovery After Surgery Protocol (ERAS-P) has been shown to improve perioperative and postoperative outcomes in many surgical specialties, including pediatric spine deformities. To our knowledge, no such standardized protocol has been developed for vertebral body tethering (VBT) despite unique challenges given its anterior approach. To fill this gap, we developed a Team Integrated Enhanced Recovery (TIGER) Protocol and assessed its effect on perioperative and postoperative outcomes following VBT.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> We retrospectively compared outcomes from 69 consecutive patients treated with a Main Thoracic Tether who received no protocol (P0; n&#x2009;=&#x2009;23) to either Version 1 (P1; n&#x2009;=&#x2009;23) or Version 2 (P2; n&#x2009;=&#x2009;23) of the TIGER Protocol. P0 included a minimum one-night stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) with no other specific postoperative management strategies. P1 incorporated multimodal analgesia without a planned stay in the ICU. P2 discontinued patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) on postoperative day 1 with early chest tube removal. We assessed (1) Patient-Reported Pain (PRP), Oxycodone a Doses (OD), (4) Chest Tube Duration (CTD), Length of Stay (LOS), and any complications (e.g. readmissions) that occurred within the first 90&#x2009;days. Differences between P&#x2019;s were determined using a one-way analysis of variance with an alpha of&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;0.05 indicating significance.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> We observed a significant decrease in most variables across P0, P1, and P2 (Table 1), with the largest differences being between P0 and P2. We significantly reduced LOS and CTD by 2.1 and 1.9&#x2009;days, respectively, between P0 and P2. The number of OD increased on postoperative day 1 between P0 and P2 (1.6 versus 3.3 doses) but was followed by a pronounced decrease on postoperative day 3 (4.3 versus 2.3 doses). Likewise, PRP was more than one point lower on postoperative days 2 (3.2 versus 2.1) and 3 (2.8 versus 1.7) between P0 and P2. We observed one complication in P0, two in P1, and two in P2; three complications required additional surgical intervention and two resulted in readmissions.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The TIGER Protocol significantly improved outcomes without a subsequent increase in complications, including readmissions. These data highlight the importance of developing perioperative and postoperative protocols specific to VBT and act as the foundation for the development of similar protocols at other institutions.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> An ERAS-P can be a safe and effective way to improve perioperative and postoperative outcomes related to LOS, CTD, OD, and PRP in patients treated with VBT.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> In the medical treatment of stress fracture (spondylolysis) in the lumbar spine, computed tomography (CT) scan has been commonly used to classify the stage of the fracture for the treatment plan. However, compared to adults, children have higher radiosensitivity in each organ and have a longer life expectancy, so their radiation exposure should be reduced. With these situations as a background, we have started using bone-like image (BLI) of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in place of plain CT scan recently. The aim of this study was to validate the BLI of each stage of the lumbar spondylolysis compared with CT scans.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> We retrospectively investigated BLIs and CT scans of 92 patients (83 males and 9 females, mean 13.9&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;2.0&#x2009;years) with lumbar spondylolysis taken from July 2021 to March 2023. A total of 838 pars interarticularis was examined, and all the date interval between CT and MRI were within 1&#x2009;month, and each finding was compared. The BLI used in this study was based on a Siemens 3 Tesla volumetric interpolated breath-hold imaging (VIBE). The CT-based staging (early, progressive, terminal) was matched with the BLI-based staging (incomplete fracture line, complete fracture line, and gap of 2&#x2009;mm or more) due to its characteristics, respectively.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Of the 99 &#x201C;early-stage fracture,&#x201D; 88 were interpreted as &#x201C;incomplete fracture&#x201D; on BLI (concordance rate: 88.9%). Of the 48 &#x201C;progressive-stage fracture,&#x201D; 36 were interpreted as &#x201C;complete fracture&#x201D; (concordance rate: 75.0%). And, of the 16 &#x201C;terminal-stage fracture,&#x201D; 12 were interpreted as gap (concordance rate: 75.0%). Out of 675 pars interpreted as &#x201C;no fracture&#x201D; on BLI, 7 fractures were detected on CT scans. Sensitivity/specificity/accuracy of the BLI in diagnosing fractures compared with CT scans was 88.9/99.3/98.1% in early stage, 75.0/99.0/97.6% in progressive stage, 75.0/99.1/98.7% in terminal stage, and 83.4/97.0/94.4% for all fractures.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Although ability of BLI for staging of lumbar spondylolysis was not completely consistent, it is considered sufficient for use in clinical practice. In the future, this imaging technology may become indispensable for reducing radiation exposure in the medical treatment for children with spinal diseases.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This study presents MR BLI as a big potential to reduce medical radiation exposure in the medical treatment for many spinal diseases.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Spondylolysis is the most common cause of low back pain in young athletes. The study compares outcomes of acute adolescent spondylolysis treated with a rigid brace or a placebo.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A prospective, comparative study on clinical, radiographic, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) outcomes in acute spondylolysis patients treated with a rigid thoracolumbar orthosis (Boston brace) or with a placebo (an elastic lumbar support) was performed. A total of 60 patients were prospectively enrolled. First 14 patients were randomized and the remaining 46 chose treatment method themselves. Treatment time was 4&#x2009;months and follow-up time was 2&#x2009;years. HRQoL was measured using a Scoliosis Research Society-24 (SRS-24) outcome questionnaire filled before treatment and at 4-month, 12-month, and 24-month follow-up visits. The primary outcome was the HRQoL at 24&#x2009;months after treatment and whether treatment type or bony union of the spondylolysis affected it. Secondary outcomes were the bony union rates of spondylolysis with a Boston brace and a placebo, development of spondylolisthesis during follow-up time, and factors predicting development of spondylolisthesis.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Out of 60 patients, 57 were included to analysis. Thirty (30/57) patients were treated with a Boston brace and 27 (27/57) patients with a placebo. The bony union rate of spondylolysis did not differ between study groups (20/30, versus 17/27, respectively, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.789). Five patients (5/47, 95% confidence interval (CI)&#x2009;=&#x2009;4.6, 22.6%) developed spondylolisthesis during 2-year follow-up time. All spondylolisthesis remained low grade through follow-up time (mean slip&#x2009;=&#x2009;4.2&#x2009;mm, range&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.8&#x2013;7.4&#x2009;mm) and none of the patients needed operative intervention for spondylolisthesis. Predictive factors for development of spondylolisthesis besides non-union of the spondylolysis could not be estimated as there were so few patients with spondylolisthesis. The HRQoL was similar in both treatment groups in all domains of the SRS-24 through follow-up time (p&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.05 for all). Two years after treatment, patients who had bony union of the spondylolysis had higher total SRS-24 score (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.029) and higher satisfaction domain score (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0003) compared to patients with non-union of the spondylolysis, while other domains remained similar (p&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.05 for all).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Acute spondylolysis can be treated with only restriction of sports. Bony union of the spondylolysis predicts better HRQoL during 2-year follow-up time.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Achieving bony union of adolescent spondylolysis is desirable as their HRQoL is higher 2&#x2009;years after treatment. A brace is not needed for treatment. There is a risk of developing spondylolisthesis if bony union of spondylolysis is not achieved.</p>

        <p>LOE-Prognostic-Level III</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a genetic disorder that results in bone fragility and fractures. Spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis are common in patients with OI and have been shown to be of higher prevalence than in the otherwise healthy population. Our previous study from 2011 showed a prevalence of spondylolysis of 8.2% and spondylolisthesis of 10.9%. The average age of patient was 6.1&#x2009;years at the time of study. The purpose of this study was to evaluate these patients 10&#x2009;years later to better understand this condition over time.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> An institutional review board (IRB)-approved retrospective chart review was performed on the original 110 patients with OI enrolled in the prior study. Radiographic measurements in coronal and sagittal planes were performed with chart review to assess ambulatory status, OI type, and other relevant factors.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 72 patients met the inclusion and exclusion criteria for this study. The average age of patients was 15.8&#x2009;years, and 44% were Risser 4 or 5. In total, 33% (24/72) of the patients had radiographic evidence of either spondylolysis or spondylolisthesis. Spondylolysis was present in 15.3% of cases (11/72). Spondylolisthesis was present in 18.1% of the cases (13/72): 75% were isthmic and 25% were dysplastic. All spondylolistheses were grade 1. No surgeries were reported for spondylolysis or spondylolisthesis correction. All spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis were noted at L5-S1, other than one case of a concurrent L4-L5 and L5-S1 spondylolysis. Scoliosis was noted in 68% of patients (49/72). Comparing the current study to the original study from 2011, there was no significant difference in ambulatory status (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.17). There was a higher incidence of spondylolysis (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01), spondylolisthesis (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.03), and either condition combined (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01) in the current study. Within the current study, comparisons were made between those who had spondylolysis or spondylolisthesis and those who did not. The presence of spondylolisthesis was correlated with higher angles of lumbar lordosis (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.04), but spondylolysis was not associated with lordosis (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.43). There was no correlation between spondylolysis and/or spondylolisthesis with the degree of thoracic kyphosis (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.22, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.35) or the presence of scoliosis (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.58, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.60). Ambulatory status correlated with the presence of isthmic spondylolisthesis only (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02) and not with dysplastic spondylolisthesis or spondylolysis (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.26).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In our study, the incidence of spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis is notably higher than the 6%&#x2013;8% incidence rate which has been described in an otherwise healthy population.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Patients with OI have an increased risk for spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis development.</p>

        <p>LOE-Prognostic-Level III</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Posterior spinal fusion has been widely applied for treatment of L5/S1 spondylolisthesis in children. However, the optimal fusion levels for the surgical treatment of spondylolisthesis have been a subject of controversy. The necessity of fusing L4 remains unclear.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> We retrospectively reviewed 68 children with dysplastic L5/S1 spondylolisthesis who underwent posterior lumbar interbody fusion surgery in two hospitals. Patients were divided into two groups according to the upper instrumented vertebra (Group L4 and Group L5). Data were collected from medical records and radiological images preoperatively and at last follow-up. Radiographic parameters including pelvic incidence, pelvic tilt, sacral slope, lumbar lordosis, sagittal vertical axis, slip percentage, SDSG dysplastic lumbosacral angle, Dubousset&#x2019;s lumbosacral angle, and severity index were measured. Surgery-related data and complication data were also collected. The incidence of complications was compared, including neurologic deficit, adjacent segment instability (ASI), and other complications. ASI was defined as progress of slippage&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;3&#x2009;mm, or posterior opening&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;5&#xB0; in the adjacent segment. The number rating scale (NRS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores were used to evaluate the clinical outcome. All patients were followed for at least 2&#x2009;years.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Among 68 patients, there were 15 patients in Group L4 and 53 in Group L5. Patients involved in the two groups had similar baseline demographic characteristics and radiographic parameters. Post-operative slip percentage and SDSG dysplastic lumbosacral angle were significantly lower in the Group L5 (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). No other post-operative radiographic differences were observed between groups. Transient neurologic deficits occurred in one patient in the Group L4 and three in the Group L5 (p&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.05). There were 13 cases of adjacent segment instability in Group L5, compared with none in Group L4 (24.5% versus 0%, p&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.05). Out of the 13 patients with ASI, 4 underwent revision surgery due to L4-L5 level instability and clinical symptoms. The other patients remained asymptomatic. NRS and ODI scores at last follow-up were also not significantly different between the two groups. Figure 1 shows a 10-year-old girl with high-grade dysplastic spondylolisthesis who underwent posterior L5-S1 fixation and fusion.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Fusion to L5 could achieve comparable satisfactory results to fixing to L4, albeit with an increased likelihood of ASI. Extending fusion to L4 may not be necessary for most of pediatric L5/S1 spondylolisthesis.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This article assesses the need for extending fusion to the L4 in pediatric L5/S1 spondylolisthesis correction to provide valuable insights for guiding the selection of fusion level.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Previous studies have reported variable risks associated with surgical treatment of idiopathic kyphosis (IK) when compared with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). Some studies report comparable complication profiles while others suggest IK is higher risk. This study aims to compare 90-day and 1-year complication and reoperation rates from a large administrative database.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> We used ICD-10 and CPT codes to identify patients aged 10&#x2013;18 who underwent spinal fusion for AIS or IK between 2015 and 2021 in the Truven Marketscan database, which is an administrative claims database representing inpatient and outpatient encounters across the United States. Demographics, surgical variables, and complications for patients with 90-day and 1-year post-operative follow up were analyzed. Multivariable logistic regression modeling was performed to identify factors associated with complications and reoperations.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> We identified 3625 operative IK and AIS cases (3406 AIS, 219 IK) with 90-day follow-up. The IK cohort was older (age 15.2 versus 14.3, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), had more males (54% versus 25%, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), more comorbidities (0.3 versus 0.1, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), more Ponte osteotomies (58% versus 40%, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), and longer length of stay (4.9&#x2009;days versus 3.8&#x2009;days; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). The 90-day complication rate was 13.7% in the IK cohort versus 4.8% in the AIS cohort(p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Reoperation rate was 12.8% in the IK cohort versus 4.0% in the AIS cohort(p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). 2401 operative cases (2260 AIS, 141 IK) had 1-year follow-up. The 1-year complication rate was 15.6% in the IK cohort versus 5.4% in the AIS cohort(p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). The reoperation rate was 13.5% in the IK cohort versus 4.7% in the AIS cohort (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Regression analysis controlling for patient characteristics demonstrated that IK was associated with increased odds of overall complications at 90&#x2009;days (odds ratio (OR)&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.59; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) and 1&#x2009;year (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.61; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) an increased odds of reoperation at 90&#x2009;days (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.78; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) and 1&#x2009;year (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.38; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) versus AIS. There was no association between 1-year complication or reoperation rates and age, sex, length of stay, geographic region, or Ponte osteotomies.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> We used a large administrative database to compare the 90-day and 1-year complication and reoperation rates following spinal fusion for IK and AIS. Patients who undergo surgical treatment of IK have significantly increased risk of complications and reoperations than patients with AIS at 90&#x2009;days and 1&#x2009;year.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> These data should be useful to providers to counsel patients about risks, benefits, and expected outcomes of surgical treatment for IK scoliosis.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Following arthroscopic Bankart repair (ABR) for anterior glenohumeral instability (GHI), adolescent athletes have higher rates of subsequent recurrent instability (R-GHI) than any other sub-population. Elucidating which adolescents are at highest risk of post-operative R-GHI may optimize surgical decision-making. The purpose of this study was to identify prognostic factors associated with recurrent instability requiring re-operation following ABRs, with particular attention to the number of dislocations sustained prior to the index arthroscopic Bankart procedure.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Patients 12&#x2013;21&#x2009;years old who had undergone ABR for anterior GHI at a pediatric tertiary care hospital between 2000 and 2020 were included. A multivariate Cox proportional hazards model, with percentage of patients with R-GHI undergoing re-operation, was utilized with a time-to-event outcome analysis. The Cox model effects were expressed as the hazard ratio (HR). All tests were two-sided, with alpha of 0.05.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Four hundred and eighty-eight adolescent ABR patients (78% male; mean age: 16.9&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1.98&#x2009;years) were analyzed, with 86 patients (17.6%) undergoing revision stabilization for R-GHI, yielding a cumulative risk of 8.8% at 2&#x2009;years, 16.5% at 5&#x2009;years, and 20% at 15&#x2009;years. Revision stabilization procedures occurred at a mean of 2.6&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;2.1&#x2009;years from ABR. Risk factors for revision stabilization included&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;1 pre-operative dislocation (2 dislocations: HR&#x2009;=&#x2009;7.4, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0003; 3+ dislocations: HR&#x2009;=&#x2009;10.9, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001), presence of a Hill-Sachs lesion (small: HR&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.5, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0114; medium-large: HR&#x2009;=&#x2009;4.2, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0004), younger age (1-year decrease: HR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.2, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0015), and participation in contact sports (HR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.8, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01). Adolescents with only one pre-operative dislocation had a cumulative incidence of revision stabilization (3.2%), which was significantly lower than those with 2 (24.2%) or 3+ pre-operative dislocations (33.5%).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The number of dislocations prior to index ABR was the strongest risk factor for R-GHI requiring revision stabilization in adolescents with anterior GHI, with two dislocations conferring &gt;sevenfold increased risk compared to a single pre-operative dislocation. Other significant risk factors included the presence of a Hill-Sachs lesion, younger age, and participation in contact sports.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This large cohort allowed for methodologically rigorous statistical techniques to clarify the precise risk factors, and degree of risk, for developing recurrent GHI following ABR in adolescent athletes, the population who is both at greatest risk for developing GHI and for ultimately experiencing post-operative recurrent GHI.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Medial humeral epicondyle fractures account for 12%&#x2013;20% of pediatric and adolescent elbow fractures. As the return of full range of motion (ROM) is a key recovery outcome in pediatric and adolescent patients, it is critical to identify factors which may decrease the risk of elbow stiffness. The purpose of this study is to investigate the interplay of the following variables and their association(s) with regaining full ROM: association between surgical versus nonoperative treatment, length of immobilization, engagement in formal physical therapy, and length of time between injury and treatment.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> This study was conducted prospectively utilizing data from the Medial Epicondyle Multicenter Outcomes (MEMO) cohort study group. Patients diagnosed with a medial epicondyle fracture between 8 and 18&#x2009;years old, treated surgically or non-surgically (at the discretion of the treating surgeon), were included if they had at least 1&#x2009;year of follow-up data. Regaining full ROM as defined by 0&#xB0;&#x2013;140&#xB0; extension, or within 5&#xB0; of extension or 10&#xB0; of flexion compared to the contralateral side, total time of immobilization following initiation of treatment, participation in formal physical or operational therapy, and the time from injury to treatment initiation (e.g. surgery or casting) were recorded.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A greater proportion of surgically treated patients (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;150) regained full ROM compared to nonoperatively treated patients (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;52) (71% versus 56%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.05). Immobilization time was statistically significantly shorter in patients who were treated operatively than those treated non-operatively (2.0&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1.1&#x2009;weeks versus 3.0&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1.2&#x2009;weeks, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). The time of immobilization for those who regained full ROM was statistically significantly shorter than those who did not regain full ROM (2.1&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1.2&#x2009;weeks versus 2.6&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1.1&#x2009;weeks, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.004). Multivariable regression analysis revealed that immobilization time was an independent predictor of regaining full ROM (b&#x2009;=&#x2009;&#x2212;0.353, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02) and each week of prolonged immobilization decreased the chances of regaining full ROM by 35%.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The results illustrated that surgically managed patients, despite typically presenting with greater fracture displacement, had better ROM outcomes with a lower incidence of residual elbow stiffness. This association was mediated by shorter immobilization times resulting in more reliably regaining full ROM.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Because elbow stiffness is a common and feared negative outcome after medial epicondyle fracture treatment, techniques to minimize immobilization times should be considered. With surgical treatment requiring shorter posttreatment immobilization times, surgery may provide an avenue for consistently superior postoperative ROM outcomes in the treatment of medial epicondyle humerus fractures.</p>

        <p>LOE-Therapeutic-Level IV</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Chondral fractures of the knee are common in adolescents and pre-adolescents because of the weaker interface between the articular cartilage and the subchondral bone. Controversy remains regarding the viability of the fragment, if it is going to heal if we fix it, and if it is going to be mechanically functional in the mid- and long-term. The aim of this work is to report the mid-term radiological (magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) and clinical (patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs)) results of traumatic chondral lesions of the knee in adolescents that were fixed.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Thirty-three adolescents and pre-adolescents with a traumatic chondral lesion of the knee were included. Demographic, clinical, and surgical data were collected, including symptoms (pain, blockage, joint effusion), presence of patellar instability, lesion location and size, number of implants, and associated surgical procedures. The detached fragment was fixed through an arthrotomy using bioabsorbable pins (Smartnail, Conmed) (Figure 1). Preoperative and postoperative MRI were analyzed. Patients were asked to fill the Kujala, KOOS, Lysholm, Tegner, and UCLA Activity level questionnaires.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Mean age at the time of trauma 13.5&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;2.2&#x2009;years. Average time until MRI was performed 66&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;79.5&#x2009;days (median&#x2009;=&#x2009;24&#x2009;days). Average time until surgery 103&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;105&#x2009;days (median&#x2009;=&#x2009;64&#x2009;days). Location was patella (54.5%), lateral femoral condyle (33%), femoral trochlea (9%), and medial femoral condyle (3%). Symptoms at the ER were pain (97%), effusion (51.5%), snapping (33%), and locking (6%). 54.5% reported an episode of patellar dislocation. Physis were open at the time of diagnosis in 85% of the patients. The average follow-up was 5.7&#x2009;years (SD&#x2009;=&#x2009;3; 1.5&#x2013;14), with an average age of 19.4&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;3.9&#x2009;years. According to MRI results (average 21&#x2009;months after surgery), all cases healed with good aspect of the articular cartilage. At the latest follow-up, the mean PROMS results were Kujala 87.3; KOOS 91.8; Lysholm 83.1; Tegner 6; and UCLA Activity Level 7.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Fixation of traumatic chondral injuries of the knee in adolescents or pre-adolescents obtains good clinical and radiological results after a mean follow-up of 5.7&#x2009;years.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Due to these good results, we strongly recommend fixing a traumatic chondral injury of the knee in pre-adolescents or adolescents.</p>

        <p>LOE-Prognostic-Level II</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Although the risk factors for patellofemoral dislocation are clearly defined, specific risk factors for osteochondral fracture (OCF) after patellar dislocation have not been defined yet. The aim of this study was to determine risk factors for OCF by evaluating patients with and without OCF after first-time acute patellar dislocation (APD).</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> This multi-center study was conducted as a retrospective examination of the radiological measurements on the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of 306 patients. The patients were divided into the OCF group and non-OCF group, and OCFs were grouped according to whether the fracture was in the patella or femur. Patellar height, patellar lateralization, trochlear morphology, patellofemoral matching, and patella types were evaluated on patient MRIs. The presence of hyperlaxity in the patients was determined according to the Beighton scale score. The injury mechanisms of the patients were grouped as pivot sports (contact or non-contact) injuries, injuries resulting from simple falls or straight running, and injuries during daily activities.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 120 OCFs were detected in 108 (35.2%) patients, of which 96 (80%) were in the patella and 24 (20%) in the femur. The rate of OCF after pivot sports injury was found to be significantly higher than in other injury mechanisms (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001). The rate of absence of hyperlaxity in cases with OCF was found to be statistically higher (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001). The measurements of tibial tubercule-trochlear groove (TT-TG), tibial tubercule-posterior cruciate ligament (TT-PCL) distance, and lateral patellar displacement were statistically higher in cases with OCF (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001). In patients without hyperlaxity, the rate of OCF localization in the patella was significantly higher (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001). No correlation was found between any other parameters and OCF (p&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.05). The absence of hyperlaxity, and the measurements of TT-TG distance, TT-PCL distance, and lateral patellar displacement were independent risk factors for the incidence of OCF according to the logistic regression analysis.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The absence of hyperlaxity and patellar lateralization are independent risk factors for the occurrence of OCF after first-time patellar dislocation. Pivot sports injury is a non-independent risk factor for the presence of OCF. In patients without hyperlaxity, the incidence of OCF in the patella is higher than in the femur. These important factors should be considered when evaluating patients and starting their treatment.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> The main findings of the current study were that pivot sports (contact, non-contact) injury, absence of hyperlaxity, and lateralized patella were risk factors for OCF after first-time APD in the adolescent patient group.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Patellofemoral instability (PFI) is frequently associated with chondral injuries to the patella and trochlea. Although prior studies have demonstrated a link between patellar dislocation and chondral injury, the influence of the number of patellar dislocation events on chondral wear is not established. This study aimed to understand the association between the number of patellar instability events and chondral damage in a large population undergoing patellar stabilization procedures.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> This was a retrospective review of patients undergoing primary PFI procedures from December 2016 to September 2022 in the prospective, multi-center Justifying Patellar Instability Treatment by Results (JUPITER) cohort. Cartilage lesions were classified using the International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) classification, where ICRS grades 2&#x2013;4 are defined as abnormal or severely abnormal. The number of dislocation events was grouped into 1&#x2013;2, 3&#x2013;5, and&#x2009;&gt;5 dislocations. Multivariable regressions were used to control for demographic characteristics potentially influencing cartilage wear.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 938 patients at mean age 16.2&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;3.8&#x2009;years (61.4% female) were included. Of these, 580 (61.8%) demonstrated a chondral injury. The most commonly affected region was the patella (53.1%), followed by the femoral condyles (15.8%), and trochlea (109, 11.6%). Medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) reconstruction was performed in 861 (91.8%) cases. There were no differences in the presence (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.21) or grade (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.72) of patellar chondral lesions based on the dislocation number. Patients with&#x2009;&gt;5 patellar dislocations more frequently had a trochlear chondral lesion (19.8%) than the groups with fewer dislocations (1&#x2013;2: 8.4%, 3&#x2013;5: 13.0%, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). A greater number of dislocations were also associated with a higher proportion of ICRS grades 2&#x2013;4 trochlear lesions (&gt;5: 15.3%, 3&#x2013;5: 11.7%, 1&#x2013;2: 7.6%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.009). Combined patellar and trochlear lesions were also higher in the most frequent dislocation group (&gt;5 dislocations: 15.8%, 3&#x2013;5: 9.9%, 1&#x2013;2: 6.1%, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). In multivariable regression accounting for age, sex, BMI, and dislocation count, a dislocation count&#x2009;&gt;5 was the only variable significantly predictive of the presence of a trochlear chondral lesion (odds ratio [OR] 2.16, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.36&#x2013;3.43, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This study demonstrates that an increased number of patellofemoral dislocation events are associated with more frequent trochlear and combined patellar/trochlear chondral damage with higher injury severity potentially requiring surgical management.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This is the first, large prospective study to demonstrate that multiple patellar dislocations can result in increased and more severe chondral damage.</p>

        <p>LOE-Prognostic-Level III</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Trochlear dysplasia is the most consistent risk factor for recurrent patellofemoral instability (PFI), but there is limited understanding of how the trochlea develops during growth. The aim of this study is to evaluate serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed in skeletally immature patients with and without PFI to characterize changes in trochlear anatomy over time. We predict that PFI leads to progressive worsening of trochlear dysplasia over time.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective case-control study was conducted on pediatric patients (&lt;18 year old) with and without a diagnosis of PFI who had multiple ipsilateral MRIs of the knee at least 6&#x2009;months apart. Inclusion criteria were patients with open distal femoral physis at the initial MRI and no intervening surgery between MRIs. All patients with PFI were included, and 30 age-matched patients without PFI were identified for comparison. MRIs were retrospectively reviewed to evaluate trochlear morphology using Dejour and Oswestry-Bristol Classifications (OBC) and to measure sulcus angle (SA), trochlear depth index (TDI), medial condylar trochlear offset (MCTO), and lateral trochlear inclination (LTI). Univariate and bivariate statistics were performed to evaluate differences in morphology between MRIs and between groups.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Ninety-eight PFI patients with an average age of 12.5&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;2.5&#x2009;years at initial MRI and 30 non-PFI patients with an average age of 11.6&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;2.8&#x2009;years were identified. Among PFI patients, rates of moderate to severe (Dejour B-D, OBC flat or convex) trochlear dysplasia increased from the initial to the most recent imaging (67% vs 88%, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), and statistically significantly more dysplastic LTI and SA were observed on follow-up (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). Among non-PFI patients, the percentage of patients with normal trochlear morphology increased from 53% to 87% (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), and less dysplastic measures of TDI, LTI, and SA were seen on follow-up imaging (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). When comparing rates of change, trochlear metrics changed toward a more shallow and dysplastic direction in the PFI cohort and toward a deeper and less dysplastic direction in the non-PFI group.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Skeletally immature patients with untreated PFI have trochlear dysplasia that progressively worsens over time. Conversely, those without PFI have trochlear characteristics that appear to normalize with growth. Future work should seek to determine whether patellar stabilization interventions can impact trochlear morphologic changes.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This study indicates that during early adolescence, trochlear morphology progressively worsens in patients with PFI but progressively deepens in those without PFI.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Chondral and osteochondral fracture (OCF) are frequently encountered during patellar dislocation. The incidence of such fractures that may require surgical intervention is not known. It is also not known which patient or anatomic risk factors are related to the occurrence of these fractures. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the incidence of OCF following patellar dislocation and identify the risk factors related to the presence of OCF.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Using a hospital-based surgery database from 2012 to 2022, patients who underwent medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) reconstruction were identified. Two distinct groups were established based on the presence of an OCF. Age, gender, skeletal maturity, BMI, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), sports injury, reduction requirement, history of contralateral instability, and first-time vs recurrent ipsilateral patellar dislocation were noted. Trochlear depth, Caton-Deschamps Index, tibial tubercule-trochlear groove (TT-TG) distance, and patellar tilt were calculated on MRI. The independent <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-test was used for comparison of continuous variables, and chi-square test was used for comparison of categorical variables.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> During the study period, 555 knees in 468 patients had MPFL reconstruction. Of these, 177 knees (31.9%) had contralateral instability. The average age at surgery was 15 (&#xB1;2.83) years. Of all, 65.4% were female. Two hundred twenty-five (40.5%) were skeletally immature. One hundred twenty-two knees (22%) had first-time dislocation, and 433 knees (78%) had recurrent dislocation. Ninety-eight knees (17.7%) required reduction of patellar dislocation, and 45.8% of dislocation were sports related. One hundred fifty-two knees (27%) had an OCF. Forty-six (30%) OCFs required fixation (33 with screw, 11 with bioabsorbable nail, and 2 combined). The average size of OCF that required fixation was 18&#x2009;mm (7&#x2013;31&#x2009;mm) (Figure 1). The rate of OCF fixation in the first dislocation group was 27%, and in the recurrent instability group, it was 3%. Male gender (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002, odds ratio [OR]&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.8) and first-time dislocation (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01, OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;14.9) were risk factors for OCF. EDS diagnosis (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.009, OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.46) and contralateral instability (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01, OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;3.3) were protective factors for OCF. Patella alta was a protective factor (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.03) for OCF, but trochlear dysplasia, patellar tilt, and TT-TG distance were not.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In this large surgically treated patellar instability cohort, the rate of OCF that had to be addressed was 27%. The average size of OCF that underwent fixation was 18&#x2009;mm. First-time dislocation in males constituted an at-risk group for presence of OCF. Contralateral instability, EDS, and patella alta were protective factors.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Knowledge related to the incidence and risk factors related to presence of OCF would help in patient counseling and surgical planning.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Various techniques have been described for medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction (MPFLR) in the setting of patellofemoral instability (PFI). Most rely on bony patellar-sided fixation, carrying the small but not insignificant risk of iatrogenic patellar fracture as well as implant cost. Alternative soft-tissue patellar-sided fixation options have been described, but comparisons with traditional techniques are limited. The purpose of this study was to compare postoperative complication and risk of recurrent instability among three MPFLR techniques in a multicenter trial with a population of young PFI patients.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective comparative study was conducted from 2010 to 2021 at two large tertiary care pediatric hospitals identifying adolescent and young adult patients who underwent isolated MPFLR. Patients were grouped based on patellar fixation: (1) allograft bony patellar fixation (BPF) with suture anchors or interference screws, (2) autograft quadriceps tendon turndown (QTT), and (3) allograft modified basketweave (MBW). The latter two techniques utilize suture-based fixation of the graft to the anterior patellar periosteum. Patient demographics, preoperative imaging measures, postoperative complications, and need for subsequent stabilization surgery were recorded. Treatment groups were compared with univariate testing.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> We identified 217 patients undergoing isolated MPFLR (83 BPF, 98 QTT, 36 MBW) who had a mean age of 15.3&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;2.36&#x2009;years (8.0&#x2013;18.9&#x2009;years) and were predominantly female (60%). All baseline characteristics and preoperative imaging measures were similar between treatment groups (Table 1) except for sex distribution (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.017). At a mean follow-up of 1.62&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1.63&#x2009;years, there was a 6% overall rate of early postoperative complication (BPF 8%, QTT 6%, and MBW 8%) and a 13% rate of persistent subluxation or dislocation (BPF 16%, QTT 10%, and MBW 14%) of which 3.7% (BPF 3.6%, QTT 3.1%, and MBW 5.6%) required revision surgical stabilization. There were no significant differences in the rate of complications or subsequent surgical treatment among treatment groups (p&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.05).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This large, multicenter cohort of adolescents and young adults undergoing isolated MPFLR identified no significant difference in the rate of complications or persistent instability following surgical reconstruction among the three compared operative techniques. These findings support soft-tissue patellar MPFLR fixation as an acceptable alternative to traditional bony techniques.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Our findings indicate that soft-tissue patellar fixation techniques demonstrate a comparable risk profile and early outcomes to bony fixation options. Given the risks and costs of bony constructs in the setting of the evolving patellar ossification in skeletally immature patients, pediatric surgeons may safely consider these alternative options for patellar-sided MPFLR fixation.</p>

        <p>LOE-Therapeutic-Level II</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> There has been a change of paradigm toward MPFL reconstruction (MPFLR) in treating patellar instability. Previously, proximal realignment procedures (PRP), such as Madigan and Insall, were usual, supported by the idea that growing bones were not involved. We aimed to compare the long-term results of MPFLR and PRP, particularly the risk of redislocation and the rate of early postoperative osteoarthritis.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> All patients aged&#x2009;&lt;17&#x2009;years, with open physis (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;129), who had been treated surgically due to patellar instability in 2005&#x2013;2019 were preliminary included. Nonresidents and patients treated with procedures other than MPFLR/PRP (e.g. tibial tuberosity transfer, sulcus plasty, medial repair) were excluded. Finally, there were 24 patients with 25 knees, out of 31 eligible ones (81%), who participated in long-term clinical and radiographic follow-up visits after mean 9 (2&#x2013;18) years postoperatively. Surgery performed was based on treating surgeon&#x2019;s preference and selected individually for every patient. Redislocation and osteoarthritis in radiographs were the main outcomes. Subjective outcomes were also evaluated.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> The overall rate of redislocation was 44% (11/25). It was higher (7/10, 70%) after PRP, compared to MPFLR (4/15, 26.7%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.027). Osteoarthritis (Kellgren and Lawrence groups (KL) II&#x2013;IV) in the tibiofemoral joint was found in 4/10 (40%) knees after PRP and none after MPFLR (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.008). The respective numbers of patellofemoral osteoarthritis (KL II&#x2013;IV) were 4/10 (40%) after PRP and one (6.7%) after MPFLR (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.004). Altogether 2/10 (20%) patients in PRP vs 10/15 (66.7%) in MPFLR groups reported no disabilities in daily activities (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.032). Eight of 10 (80%) in PRP and 4/15 (26.7%) in MPFLR groups, respectively, were unable to participate in any or specific sports at the time of follow-up (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.008). There was no difference in subjective knee-specific recovery measured by IKDC (MPFLR 77.8 (SD 14.9) vs PRP 77.5 (SD 18.4), p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.973) or Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale (MPFLR 80.5 (SD 12.9) vs PRP 77.1 (15.2), p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.589).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In the long term, a great majority (70%) of the patients treated with PRP suffered from redislocation, which is 2.6-fold higher than the rate for those treated with MPFL (27%). PRPs are associated with high (40%) rate of osteoarthritis, given that the patients were young adults, aged&#x2009;&lt;36&#x2009;years, at the time of follow-up.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> MPFLR should be the choice of treatment, also in skeletally immature patients.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Unstable osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) lesions of the knee require treatment of the pathologic subchondral bone as well stabilization of the overlying articular cartilage. The purpose of this study is to describe the surgical technique and early outcomes of OCD debridement, autogenous bone grafting, and suture-based repair of unstable OCD of the knee in pediatric patients.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective single-institution study was performed of patients with an unstable OCD of the femoral condyle treated with open debridement, autogenous bone grafting, and suture-based repair between January 2020 and May 2022. Patients were contacted prospectively at the time of the study to complete patient-reported outcome scores (PROs) (pedi-IKDC and HSS Pedi-FABS).</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Ten patients, five females and five males, with a mean age of 13.6&#x2009;years (range 9.0&#x2013;16.0), were included. OCD location was the medial femoral condyle in eight patients and lateral femoral condyle in two patients. All patients underwent arthrotomy, mobilization of the articular cartilage while maintaining an intact hinge, debridement of fibrinous tissue, and curettage and drilling of the sclerotic bed. Distal femoral autograft was harvested from the ipsilateral femoral metaphysis, morcellated, and compacted into the OCD base. The chondral fragment was then repaired utilizing a suture-bridge construct with Vicryl suture (nine patients) or braided nonabsorbable suture (one patient) loaded through small knotless anchors. Magnetic resonance images (MRIs) were obtained in nine patients to assess healing at a mean of 6&#x2009;months postoperatively. MRI demonstrated bone graft incorporation, minimal bone edema, and a congruent articular cartilage surface in seven patients (78%). One patient had progressive failure of the repair with a loose body, ultimately requiring conversion to osteochondral allograft transplantation 5&#x2009;months following repair. A second patient had bone marrow edema on her postoperative MRI and later went on to develop progressive instability with cystic changes resulting in conversion to an osteochondral allograft 2&#x2009;years after repair. Mean clinical follow-up was 13&#x2009;months. PROs were obtained in nine patients (90%) at a mean time of 23&#x2009;months following surgery. Median Pedi-IKDC was 100 and HSS Pedi-FABS was 22. Nine patients participated in sports prior to surgery, and eight (89%) returned to sports following surgery.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> OCD debridement with autogenous bone grafting and suture-based repair is a viable single-stage surgical treatment for unstable OCD of the knee.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This novel surgical treatment for unstable OCDs improves biology at the parent-progeny interface, enhances stability, and maintains the native cartilage without the implant-related complications associated with metal screws or bioabsorbable implants.</p>

        <p>LOE-Prognostic-Level III</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Osteochondritis dissecans of the knee (KOCD) is uncommon, often presenting in active, skeletally immature patients. An association between condylar OCD lesion location and lower-extremity coronal plane angular deformity has been established, but the clinical implication is evolving. This study aimed to confirm the high rate of coronal malalignment in KOCD and the variation in demographics, presentation features, and radiologic disease severity between those with and without malalignment.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Patients enrolled in an institutional prospective cohort on KOCD were reviewed. Patients with more than one KOCD in the same knee or inadequate/missing standing alignment imaging within 3&#x2009;months of presentation were excluded. Prospectively collected clinical, demographic, and radiographic data were obtained, and standard standing alignment measurements were performed. Comparative analysis was performed between KOCD in each condyle presenting with malalignment compared to those that did not.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 156 patients (187 knees) were included, with a mean age of 12.91 years (range 5.42&#x2013;18.34), 36.36% female, and 66.3% MFC lesions. Of all skeletally immature condylar KOCD, 39.83% presented with malalignment. Twenty-nine of 124 (23.4%) MFC KOCDs were in varus, with most in grade I (26, 21.0%). Forty-two of 63 (66.7%) LFC KOCDs were in valgus, with 46.0% being grade I, 17.5% grade II, and 3.2% grade III. MFC KOCDs in varus were more likely to be &#x201C;Black or African American&#x201D; (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.008), larger (coronal width 16.6&#x2009;mm vs 14.1&#x2009;mm, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.008), have a linear fluid signal on MRI (64.3% vs 38.8%; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.019), and undergo surgery (86.2% vs 57.9%; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.007). Similar differences were found in LFC KOCDs in valgus, including larger size (sagittal width 20.79&#x2009;mm vs 16.37&#x2009;mm; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.006) and a majority &#x201C;Black or African American&#x201D; presentation (91.7%; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.05).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Over 1/3 skeletally immature patients with KOCD may be in coronal malalignment and, thus, candidates for guided growth. Valgus is very common in LFC KOCDs, especially in &#x201C;Black or African American&#x201D; patients, and is associated with larger anterior to posterior lesions. MFC KOCDs in varus are commonly larger and more advanced lesions.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> The results of this study are significant because they provide a foundation for various future studies. Further investigation is required to determine whether malalignment is detrimental to KOCD healing rates. The results also open doors for research into whether correcting mechanical axis deviation using guided growth surgery can aid in the healing of KOCD lesions.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Unstable osteochondritis dissecans of the capitellum (OCD-C) treated with loose-body removal and marrow stimulation has historically been associated with suboptimal return to high-demand upper-extremity sports. Fresh osteochondral allograft transplantation (OCAlloT) is an alternative treatment which restores subchondral bone and articular cartilage. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of OCAlloT in pediatric patients with unstable OCD-C 10&#x2009;mm or greater in size.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A single-center prospective study was performed of consecutive pediatric patients, less than 19&#x2009;years of age, with unstable OCD-C treated with OCAlloT using pre-cut 10-mm, 12-mm, or 16-mm cores. Imaging was obtained preoperatively to assess OCD characteristics, and postoperatively to assess incorporation of the graft. Patient-reported outcome scores (PROs) were obtained preoperatively and annually following surgery. Minimum follow-up duration was 2&#x2009;years.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Twenty-six elbows in 24 patients, with a mean age of 13.4&#x2009;years, met inclusion. The most common primary sport was gymnastics in 11 elbows (42%) and baseball/softball in 7 elbows (27%). Most patients (88%) played at a competitive level. OCD location was central in 17 elbows (65%) and far lateral in 9 elbows (35%). Mean MRI size of the OCD was 11&#x2009;mm in coronal width, 12&#x2009;mm in sagittal length, and 6&#x2009;mm in depth. Most elbows (85%) were treated with a single allograft plug. Median OCA size was 12&#x2009;mm. There were no infections or arthrofibrosis. Two elbows (8%) had a secondary surgery, both underwent partial synovectomy and chondroplasty at 14 and 16&#x2009;months following the primary surgery. Postoperative MRIs were obtained in 15 elbows (58%) and had a mean BOGIE (Boston Osteochondral Graft Incorporation in the Elbow) score of 11. Mean follow-up duration was 40&#x2009;months (range 25&#x2013;60&#x2009;months). PROs are listed in Table 1. Twenty-one elbows (81%) had returned to sports at 1&#x2009;year postoperatively, and all but one patient had returned to sports by 2&#x2009;years following surgery. Forty-five percent of gymnasts returned to gymnastics, while the remaining pursued different sports. Five of six baseball players (83%) returned to baseball.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> OCAlloT as a treatment for OCD-C is associated with low rates of complications, excellent graft incorporation, high elbow function and patient satisfaction, and overall high rates of return to sports at 2&#x2009;years.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> OCAlloT as a treatment for large unstable OCD-C in athletes playing high-demand upper-extremity sports may be associated with more durable early to midterm outcomes than debridement and marrow stimulation.</p>

        <p>LOE-Therapeutic-Level III</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Temporary epiphysiodesis (tED) of the distal femur and proximal tibia is an established procedure for correction of leg length discrepancy (LLD). Moreover, it may be employed bilaterally to reduce excessive height. This study evaluated the effect of tED with two different devices on potential intraarticular deformity and coronal malalignment in individuals between 8 and 16&#x2009;years of age.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective radiological analysis of children who underwent tED either by implantation of RigidTacks (Merete, Berlin, Germany) or eight-Plates (Orthofix, Lewisville, TX, USA) between 2009 and 2021 was performed. The assessment of radiological parameters (femoral notch-intercondylar distance (FNID), width of femoral physis (WFP), tibial roof angle (TRA), femoral floor angle (FFA) (Fig.1), joint line convergence angle (JLCA), mechanical lateral distal femoral angle (mLDFA), medial proximal tibial angle (MPTA), and mean absolute difference (MAD)) was conducted on anteroposterior long-leg standing radiographs prior to implantation and prior to device removal, respectively.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Eighty-six individuals (33 girls, 53 boys) with a mean age of 12.5&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1.7&#x2009;years at the time of surgery were included. In 11 patients, tED was conducted bilaterally by implantation of RigidTacks at the medial and lateral distal femur and proximal tibia, respectively, to reduce excessive predicted height. In 75 patients, tED was carried out unilaterally to correct LLD. According to the origin of the LLD, devices were implanted at the distal femur (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;18), the proximal tibia (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;10), or both sites (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;47) medially and laterally. RigidTacks were used in 38 (51%), and eight-Plates in 37 (49%) of these 75 procedures. The mean postoperative follow-up duration was 3.4&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1.9&#x2009;years. In the RigidTack group, the radiological assessment showed a significant change of the FNID (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.011) after tED. In the eight-Plate group, the WFP (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.021), FNID (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.006), and MAD (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.004) changed significantly; the absolute change of the MAD was 3.6&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;4.9&#x2009;mm. These findings correlated with an absolute number of five revision surgeries (four conversions to temporary hemiepiphysiodesis, one correction osteotomy) in the eight-Plate group to correct secondary coronal malalignment. In the RigidTack group, six clinically significant changes of coronal alignment that required revision for conversion to temporary hemiepiphysiodesis were detected.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> While secondary coronal deformities were observed in both groups, significant changes in joint morphology were only detected in the eight-Plate group. However, further investigation will have to elucidate if this effect may be attributed to differences in the operation technique and implant positioning and whether these findings are clinically relevant.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Epiphysiodesis devices should cautiously be applied for tED for length correction, as they may produce significant alterations in coronal alignment and intraarticular deformity.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Removal of the metaphyseal screw from tension band plate constructs after correction of angular deformity in patients treated with hemiepiphysiodesis has been suggested as an alternative to removing the plate and both screws. While this has the potential benefit of increasing the ease of implant removal and reinsertion in the event of rebound, there is debate in the literature regarding the benefits and risks of leaving the epiphyseal screw and plate in place.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Patients treated with hemiepiphysiodesis at the distal femur and/or proximal tibia with tension band plate and screws who underwent subsequent removal of the metaphyseal screw after correction were included. Charts and radiographs were reviewed for the need for metaphyseal screw reinsertion, subsequent removal of deep implants, and evidence of physeal tethering. Tethering was defined as progressive overcorrection in the treated bone segment after removal of the metaphyseal screw with the mechanical axis moving one full mechanical axis zone or more.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 215 patients with 387 limbs treated met inclusion criteria. Of those, 175 patients were treated for idiopathic genu valgum while 40 were treated for angular deformities due to other conditions (15 skeletal dysplasia, 8 syndromic, 5 Blount&#x2019;s disease, 4 multiple hereditary exostoses, 2 focal fibrocartilaginous dysplasia, 2 posttraumatic, 2 congenital femoral deficiency, 1 nonossifying fibroma, 1 endocrine). Among all patients, 59 individuals (27%) underwent replacement of the metaphyseal screw due to need for repeat angular correction. One hundred one patients (47%) required implant removal of the tension band and epiphyseal screw construct previously left in place (74 symptomatic, 7 elective, 20 due to tethering). Overall, there were 44 cases of tethering in 36 patients (17%). Patients with tethering included 23 with idiopathic genu valgum, 4 multiple hereditary exostoses, 3 skeletal dysplasia, 2 posttraumatic, 2 syndromic, 1 congenital femoral deficiency, and 1 endocrine. In cases of tethering, seven patients were treated with observation, 11 with implant removal only, 16 with hemiepiphysiodesis on the opposite side, and 2 with osteotomy.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In patients treated with hemiepiphysiodesis with tension band plate, removal of the metaphyseal screw after correction has high rates of tethering and further surgery for iatrogenic deformity correction and implant removal. This technique is not recommended.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This is the largest series to date examining removal of the metaphyseal screw from tension band plate constructs. Tethering can occur in patients of many diagnoses and often results in the need for further surgical intervention.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Calculation of remaining growth in children and the timing of epiphysiodesis in leg length discrepancy (LLD) are commonly done by four main methods: the Green-Anderson (GA) method, the White-Menelaus (WM) method, the Moseley Straight Line Graph (M-SLG) method, and the Multiplier (MP) method. According to available literature, none of the methods have shown superior accuracy or precision than the others.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> From a local Health Register consisting of 415 children with LLD prospectively enrolled during the period 1992&#x2013;2019, 191 children (aged 10&#x2013;16&#x2009;years) treated with surgical closure of the growth plate and follow-up until skeletal maturity were included. The patients had at least two simultaneous leg-length measurements and bone age assessments with the last examination conducted 6&#x2009;months or less before surgery. We evaluated and compared the accuracy of the four prediction methods by the mean absolute prediction error (mAPE; the difference between predicted and measured leg length at maturity) for the long leg, the short leg, and the LLD, based on chronological age versus bone age and the importance of including the reduced growth rate (inhibition) of the short leg compared to the long leg in the calculations.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> The mean LLD preoperatively was 2.80 (standard deviation (SD) 1.23) cm, and at maturity, 1.26 (SD 0.99) cm. The WM method used with bone age was the most accurate method with an mAPE for the short leg of 1.6 (SD 1.3) cm, long leg 1.0 (SD 1.2) cm, and LLD 1.0 (SD 0.8) cm. Pairwise comparison of short leg and LLD according to WM and the other methods was statistically significant, also clinically relevant compared to the MP method. Incorporating the reduced growth rate of the short leg did not improve the accuracy for others compared with the WM method.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The WM method used with bone age is the most accurate method in prediction of remaining growth and the timing of epiphysiodesis in children of ages between 10 and 16&#x2009;years.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> These findings are of clinical importance for the accurate timing of epiphysiodesis.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> It is not clear if the violation of endosteal blood supply that occurs because of intramedullary canal reaming has a negative effect on the bone regeneration following limb lengthening with magnetic intramedullary lengthening nails (MILNs). Delayed consolidation, as it relates to percentage of the tibial canal reamed, has not yet been assessed in the setting of limb length discrepancy (LLD). To this end, we sought to investigate whether the following factors mediate consolidation: percentage of canal reamed, osteotomy level, age, weight, and nail size.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> This is a retrospective clinical record review of 87 patients who underwent tibial lengthening for LLD between 2014 and 2021, at one institution. The cohort included 109 cases. Degree of canal reamed was calculated as a percentage (diameter of canal after reaming/diameter of canal before reaming &#xD7; 100) and then classified into three groups (&lt;80%, 80%&#x2013;120%, and&#x2009;&gt;120%). Osteotomies were stratified by diaphyseal, meta-diaphyseal, and metaphyseal levels.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Our findings demonstrated no statistically significant (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.483) impact on the incidence of delayed consolidation arising from the degree of canal reaming prior to intramedullary nail insertion. Likewise, tibial osteotomy level was not associated with an observable change in consolidation index. Age, weight, and nail size also did not appear to mediate consolidation rate in a clinically relevant manner (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.378, 0.351, 0.142, respectively). The consolidation rate did, however, show a strong negative correlation to the amount of lengthening achieved (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Consolidation outcomes for our cohort were most affected by the amount of lengthening achieved over the course of treatment. Other variables did not emerge as evident mediators in this regard, including percent of canal reaming prior to nail insertion, osteotomy level, age, weight, and nail size. This result, though perhaps a bit surprising, is nonetheless valuable for its promising utility in clinical decision-making. In addition, this study provides a foundation for subsequent investigation beyond the scope of the tibia and one particular limb treatment facility into the larger world of lengthening goals and the nuances that govern them.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Delayed tibial consolidation after distraction osteogenesis for LLD presents a challenge for patients and surgeons alike. A comprehensive understanding of the various factors informing treatment is essential to appropriately performing safe, efficacious procedures for LLD, as well as for managing the expectations of patients and their families.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Distraction osteogenesis represents an extreme version of bone healing since the body must not only heal the osteoplasty but also produce additional new bone at the same time. Consequently, this biologic situation may be the most sensitive to the potential inhibitory effects of ketorolac on bone healing. To our knowledge, no previous study has assessed the effect of perioperative ketorolac on distraction osteogenesis in pediatric patients.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> After obtaining institutional review board (IRB) approval, a retrospective chart review of all patients younger than 17 years between 2017 and 2020 with an osteoplasty for lengthening or gradual deformity correction was performed. Data reviewed included demographics, surgery details, perioperative pain medications, duration of healing, complications, and length of follow-up. Statistical analysis was performed using Spearman&#x2019;s rank correlation test.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Seventy-six patients were identified, and each averaged four doses of ketorolac. The deformity correction group consisted of 46 patients. The average age was 13&#x2009;years, and the average deformity correction was 21&#xB0;. The average total ketorolac given was 94&#x2009;mg. At average follow-up of 22&#x2009;months, there was no correlation between the amount of ketorolac used and the duration of healing (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.82). The lengthening group consisted of 30 patients. The average age was 12&#x2009;years, and the average lengthening amount was 4.1&#x2009;cm. The average total ketorolac given was 85&#x2009;mg. At average follow-up of 21&#x2009;months, there was no correlation found between the amount of ketorolac used and the duration of healing (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.82).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> As a result of the opioid epidemic, orthopedic surgeons are using more nonnarcotic pain medications. There is still a concern in the orthopedic community that the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can affect bone healing in their patients. In our study of pediatric distraction osteogenesis patients, we found no correlation between the total amount of ketorolac used and the duration of healing in either limb lengthening or deformity correction. Since distraction osteogenesis represents a tremendous anabolic load on bone to achieve healing, the fact that our distraction osteogenesis patients did not experience any deleterious effects from ketorolac should be reassuring to the pediatric orthopedic community that perioperative ketorolac use is safe. These results reinforce and expand the previously reported evidence that NSAIDs can be used safely as a nonnarcotic alternative in all pediatric orthopedic settings.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> The results of this study are the first to demonstrate that ketorolac can be administered safely in the perioperative setting for pediatric limb-lengthening and deformity correction patients.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> The use of external fixators (EFs) for limb lengthening is common for treating lower-limb-length discrepancy (LLD) in children and adolescents. Since these patients are underage, the decision to undergo a prolonged treatment course with a nonnegligible prevalence of complications falls on parents. In this study, we evaluated the results of the Short Form 36 (SF-36) questionnaire in adult patients who had undergone lengthening surgery with an EF for LLD during childhood or adolescence.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> An Italian version of the SF-36 questionnaire was administered to a cohort of 50 patients who had undergone limb-lengthening procedures for various causes of LLD using circular EFs. These patients received treatment at an average age of 13.4&#x2009;years (range 7.0&#x2013;17.4&#x2009;years) over the period from 2009 to 2021. On average, the questionnaire was completed approximately 8.5&#x2009;years after the removal of the last EF (range 1.9&#x2013;13.5&#x2009;years). We compared the results of each questionnaire item as well as the physical and mental health summary scales (method by Ware et al.) to normative data for age and gender. Our retrospective analysis encompassed several variables, including demographic characteristics, the underlying etiology of LLD, the age at which surgery was performed, the number of lengthening procedures undertaken, preoperative LLD measurements, the total duration of treatment (TTT), the external fixator index (EFI), and residual heterometry. In addition, we assessed complications using the classification system established by Lascombes et al.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> In our study, 16% of patients exhibited Physical Component Summary (PCS) scores that fell more than 1 standard deviation (SD) below the normative data, with 6% scoring more than 2 SD below. In contrast, 84% of patients had Mental Component Summary (MCS) scores lower than 1 SD, and 44% scored lower than 2 SD, underscoring the notable prevalence of mental health issues among patients treated for LLD. We observed a modest correlation between PCS values and residual deformity, whereas MCS values exhibited a slight influence with the number of major complications and the TTT.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Treatment of LLD with a circular EF showed good results for physical function in almost all patients. However, the high prevalence of patients with mental health issues highlighted the need for greater psychological support for children and adolescents undergoing lengthening procedures.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This study is among the few evaluating the functional and psychological impact in young adults of lengthening procedures for LLD performed during childhood and adolescence.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Surgical site infection (SSI) related to intramedullary lengthening nails (ILNs) can lead to delayed consolidation or loss of limb function, resulting in deleterious effects to a patient&#x2019;s quality of life. With the increasing utilization of magnetic intramedullary lengthening nails (MILNs) in limb-lengthening procedures, we sought to determine the rate of, and risk factors for, infection associated with these newer devices.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> We reviewed a consecutive series of patients who underwent femoral and/or tibial lengthening with MILNs at a single institution between 2012 and 2020 (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;420). SSI was classified into two groups according to CDC-NHSN criteria. These were defined as, 1) &#x201C;superficial incisional&#x201D; (i.e. occurring within 30&#x2009;days postoperatively and involving incisional skin and subcutaneous tissue), and 2) &#x201C;deep incisional&#x201D; (i.e. occurring 30-365&#x2009;days postoperatively and involving fascial/muscle layers. Post-operative surveillance time was 12&#x2009;months. Demographics, health metrics, comorbidities, and limb- and surgery-related factors were assessed as potential risk factors for SSI.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Overall incidence of infection was 3.3% (14/420). Superficial infections occurred in 0.5% (2/420). Deep infection comprised 2.9% (30%, 12/420), of which 75% (9/12) were confirmed osteomyelitis. In those patients who developed SSI, the same limb had a history of prior external fixation in 57% (8/14), while 35.7% (5/14) had previous infection or a history of both. Of these, only one case of infection qualified as superficial. A sub-analysis of all patients with a history of prior external fixation in the same bone, regardless of current infectious presentation, was positively correlated with SSI. No other surgery-related infection risk factors reached statistical significance.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Patients with a history of previous external fixation and/or prior infection in the same bone show an independent association with increased rate of infection recurrence. Other speculated risk factors, such as body mass index (BMI), smoking status, certain comorbidities, and prior procedures or trauma, did not reveal an observable relationship to infectious outcomes, although this does not preclude the necessity for future investigation in expanded cohorts.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> These patients could be considered a high-risk group for developing deep-tissue infection. Potential preventatives include prolonged oral antibiotics after MILN insertion or injection of absorbable antibiotic simultaneous with nail insertion.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Intramedullary devices have become the preferred surgical implants for limb lengthening. Currently, two Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved intramedullary lengthening nails are available in the United States. While these devices have been compared to external fixation in terms of efficacy, patient comfort, and likelihood of complications, minimal information is available comparing these implants to one another.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> We reviewed all intramedullary limb-lengthening procedures performed at a single center between 2006 and 2020. Information collected included the underlying diagnosis, history of prior lengthening, discrepancy (LLD) at the time of intramedullary lengthening, implant used, and perioperative complications.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> In the 14-year study period, 44 patients underwent intramedullary limb lengthening, 24 with the Fitbone and 20 with the Precise (Table 1). There was no difference between groups with regards to underlying etiology, baseline LLD, or incidence of prior surgery or infection. Fitbone patients were more likely to have undergone prior lengthening with an external fixator (Table 1). Implant-related complications were comparable, although there was a trend toward greater implant-related revision surgeries in Fitbone patients (5 vs 1, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.19). More regenerate problems in Fitbone patients were managed surgically while regenerate problems in Precise patients were managed through modification of the lengthening protocol (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02). There were greater overall joint-related complications in the Fitbone group (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.063), but almost all Fitbone patients were managed successfully with physical therapy and modification of lengthening, whereas five Precise patients required surgical management for loss of motion and joint subluxation/dislocation.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Results suggest that these are equally effective lengthening devices with similar rates of implant-related complications. However, loss of motion and joint subluxation/dislocation are among the most serious complications of lengthening, and intramedullary implant selection does not impact this risk. That almost all Fitbone patients regained joint stability and motion through nonoperative treatment is a reminder that careful physical examination and analysis of radiographs during lengthening as well as aggressive physical therapy can effectively be used to maintain motion and joint stability in these patients.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> The Fitbone and Precise implants are equally effective at correcting limb length discrepancy with comparable rates of complications and implant-related issues. Regardless of implant choice, all patients need to be monitored closely for loss of motion and joint subluxation during lengthening. Modifying distraction rate, rhythm, and frequency in combination with aggressive physical therapy are effective methods to prevent joint-related complications while lengthening.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Magnetic intramedullary lengthening nails (MILNs) via an infrapatellar (IP) or suprapatellar (SP) approach are commonly used in tibial lengthening and deformity correction. Prior to the popularization of these devices, however, gradual deformity correction using external fixation was the norm in limb lengthening. Much of the literature has been concentrated in tibial trauma studies, which have shown MILN via SP to be associated with less knee pain than IP or external fixation. Yet no known research has similarly investigated chronic knee pain and MILNs. We assessed differences in chronic anterior knee pain following tibial lengthening via an IP or SP approach with an MILN versus an external fixator.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> We reviewed 147 tibias (55 MILN/IP, 22 MILN/SP, 71 external fixators) in 124 tibial-lengthening procedures at one institution, from February 2012 to July 2020. All explanted patients with&#x2009;&#x2265;12-month follow-up were included. Knee pain was assessed prior to surgery and then postoperatively at 6&#x2009;months and 12&#x2009;months, with both the Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale (LKSS) for functional outcomes and the numeric pain scale (0&#x2013;10) for subjective pain reporting. Differences in knee pain outcomes were compared across methods, with subgroup analysis of MILN for SP and IP.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Mean LKSS was 96.3 for external fixation and 88.5 for MILN (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.011). In the MILN sub-groups, mean LKSS was 91.7 for IP and 85.3 for SP. The IP group reported a lesser mean pain score (0.6 vs 2.1) at 12&#x2009;months. Bilateral nail recipients demonstrated no knee pain differences from unilateral. At 12&#x2009;months, external fixation had better knee functional outcomes.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Tibial lengthening via external fixation was associated with less anterior knee pain and better functional outcomes, as compared with either of the MILN approaches. Within the MILN group, IP surpassed SP, particularly in terms of subjective pain scores.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> The emergence of MILNs has been expected to offer improvements in limb-lengthening outcomes as compared to external fixation. However, MILN usage could bring new clinical challenges, particularly concerning the potential for chronic anterior knee pain and decreased functional knee outcomes postoperatively. We focused on tibial lengthening, but similar investigations into chronic knee pain could be raised in larger patient samples and/or for retrograde MILNs in the femur.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Idiopathic increased femoral anteversion (IFA) is a common finding in early childhood, and the condition normalizes spontaneously in most children. Persisting IFA after the age of 12&#x2009;years may require treatment with femoral derotational osteotomy (FDRO). However, the biomechanical and functional effects of FDRO and the selection of patients who might benefit from treatment remain uncertain. The purpose of our study was to explore the kinematic, clinical, and functional effects of FDRO, by comparing selected parameters preoperatively and 1 year after surgery.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> We performed a single-center prospective cohort study. Patients were recruited after written consent from an ongoing randomized controlled trial on IFA. Inclusion criteria were patient age 10&#x2013;18&#x2009;years, symptoms consistent with IFA, and CT-verified AV angle&#x2009;&#x2265;30&#xB0;. Three-dimensional gait analysis was performed preoperatively and 1 year after surgery. The patient group was compared to a reference group of 31 healthy children. Other outcome measures were clinical hip rotation, AV angle measured by CT, and the subscores Activity of Daily Living (ADL) and Sport on the Knee and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score for children (KOOS-Child).</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Twenty-eight FDROs were performed in 18 children (15 females). Mean age at surgery was 13.3&#x2009;years (10&#x2013;16). The mean AV angle was 51.4&#xB0; (35&#xB0;&#x2013;67&#xB0;) preoperatively and 21.1&#xB0; (3&#xB0;&#x2013;39&#xB0;) postoperatively (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Three-dimensional gait analysis in the transversal plane during stance demonstrated significant changes for hip rotation and foot progression angle. The mean internal hip rotation was 8.3&#xB0; preoperatively and 0.0&#xB0; after surgery (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). The corresponding values for internal foot progression were 12.4&#xB0; and 0.2&#xB0; (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). The clinical examination showed an improvement in external hip rotation of 26.9&#xB0;, from a mean of 11.9&#xB0; to 38.8&#xB0;. KOOS-Child showed statistically significant improvements in mean ADL (from 79 to 96 points; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) and sports (from 53 to 90 points; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Three-dimensional gait analysis 1 year after FDRO in adolescents with idiopathic IFA demonstrated significant changes in external hip rotation and foot progression angle. The increase in external hip rotation during gait was less pronounced than the clinical improvement of passive external hip rotation and the CT-measured AV angle. The operation led to significant functional improvement.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Our findings are of clinical significance and contribute to the decision-making process when evaluating adolescents with idiopathic IFA.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> This study evaluated the correlation of preoperative concurrent fibular pseudarthrosis with the risk of ankle valgus deformity in patients with congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia (CPT) who underwent successful surgical treatment.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> The children with CPT who were treated at our institution between 1 January 2013 and 31 December 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. The independent variable was preoperative concurrent fibular pseudarthrosis, and the dependent variable was postoperative ankle valgus. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed after adjusting for variables that might affect the risk of ankle valgus. Subgroup analyses with stratified multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess this association.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Of the 319 children who underwent successful surgical treatment, 140 (43.89%) developed ankle valgus deformity. Moreover, 104 (50.24%) of 207 patients with preoperative concurrent fibular pseudarthrosis developed an ankle valgus deformity compared with 36 (32.14%) of 112 patients without preoperative concurrent fibular pseudarthrosis (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002). After adjusting for sex, body mass index, fracture age, age of patient undergoing surgery, surgery method, type 1 neurofibromatosis (NF-1), limb-length discrepancy (LLD), CPT location, and fibular cystic change, patients with concurrent fibular pseudarthrosis presented a higher risk of ankle valgus than those without concurrent fibular pseudarthrosis (odds ratio (OR) 2.326, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.345&#x2013;4.022). This risk further increased with CPT location at the distal one-third of the tibia (OR 2.195, 95% CI 1.154&#x2013;4.175), age&#x2009;&lt;3&#x2009;years of patient undergoing surgery (OR 2.485, 95% CI 1.188&#x2013;5.200), LLD&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;2&#x2009;cm (OR 2.478, 95% CI 1.225&#x2013;5.015), and occurrence of NF-1 disorder (OR 2.836, 95% CI 1.517&#x2013;5.303).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our results indicate that patients with CPT and preoperative concurrent fibular pseudarthrosis have a significantly increased risk of ankle valgus compared with those without preoperative concurrent fibular pseudarthrosis, particularly in those with CPT location at the distal third, age&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;3&#x2009;years at surgery, LLD&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;2&#x2009;cm, and NF-1 disorder.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This study underscores the clinical significance of preoperative concurrent fibular pseudarthrosis in CPT patients undergoing surgical treatment. It reveals a substantial association between this condition and a heightened risk of postoperative ankle valgus deformity. The findings provide critical insights for clinicians, enabling them to identify high-risk patients, particularly those with CPT located at the distal tibia, age under 3&#x2009;years at surgery, limb-length discrepancy of less than 2&#x2009;cm, and concurrent NF-1. This knowledge informs treatment decisions, potentially reducing the incidence of ankle valgus for CPT patients.</p>

</p>
        <p>LOE-Prognostic-Level IV</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Bladder exstrophy is a rare, complex disorder involving the urinary, reproductive, intestinal, and musculoskeletal system. Skeletal findings in this condition include an externally rotated pelvis and acetabular retroversion. While these findings might be expected to cause out-toeing, there are no published data on the rotational profile of infants and toddlers with classic bladder exstrophy (CBE) to confirm this. This study therefore characterizes the rotational profile and walking age of infants and children with CBE.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective database of patients with CBE aged 0&#x2013;17 years at a tertiary care pediatric hospital from January 2014 to June 2023 was queried for historical, examination, and radiographic findings including rotational profile and age at independent ambulation. Patients with incomplete records and those with a diagnosis of cloacal exstrophy or epispadias were excluded.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 46 patients met the inclusion criteria. Seventeen (37%) were female, and 29 (63%) were male. All had exstrophy repair combined with iliac osteotomies at a median age of 3.5&#x2009;months. There were 22 (47.6%) posterior osteotomies and 24 (52.4%) anterior osteotomies. Forty-four (95.7%) osteotomies were secured with anterior suture fixation, and two with threaded wires. Patients were immobilized with either a spica cast (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;41, 89%) or skin traction (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;5, 11%). Preoperatively, bilateral hip internal and external rotation in extension averaged 43&#xB0; and 78&#xB0; degrees, respectively. After surgery, hip internal rotation initially decreased and then increased over time while external rotation decreased over the same time as shown in Figure 1. There was not a statistically significant difference in internal or external rotation between patients who had either anterior or posterior osteotomies (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.354 and 0.088, respectively). At 3&#x2009;years of age, foot progression angle (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;21) averaged&#x2009;+8.7&#xB0;&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;5.48&#xB0; (range 0&#xB0;&#x2013;20&#xB0;) while thigh foot angle (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;30) averaged&#x2009;+2.8&#xB0;&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;4.39&#xB0; (range 0&#xB0;&#x2013;10&#xB0;). Despite most patients undergoing surgery before age 1, all patients walked independently on time at a mean age of 13&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;2.4&#x2009;months (range 11&#xB0;&#x2013;18&#x2009;months).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Infants and children with CBE who undergo early reconstruction walk independently at a normal age. They also have a typical rotational profile even though their underlying pelvic anatomy may predispose them toward an externally rotated gait.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This is the first study documenting rotational profile and age at ambulation for infants and children with CBE. This study provides pediatric orthopedic surgeons with normative data for CBE and will be a valuable aid when counseling families whose child has CBE.</p>

</p>
        <p>LOE-Diagnostic-Level II</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> We previously developed standardized diagnostic criteria for development displacia of the hip (DDH) in a multinational EPOS study. These criteria were then validated in a sample of POSNA members. Our aim was that such criteria would enable nonexperts to evaluate infants for DDH in a manner approaching the practice of orthopedic surgeons, with the potential to improve early diagnosis. In this study, we present the development and validation of a diagnostic aid for DDH based on those criteria.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> We devised a diagnostic aid for use in primary care based on our previously validated diagnostic criteria; this was done in several steps with feedback from target diagnosticians. We performed a diagnostic test study in an enriched sample of target infants. The index test was the diagnostic aid administered by 38 family physicians, who examined 354 six- to eight-week-olds. The reference standard test was the outcome of the infant&#x2019;s examination in a specialist infant hip clinic. The tests were performed concurrently in a setting mimicking primary care. Blinding was maintained at all levels.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> The diagnostic aid resulted in a nine-item binary checklist and a short video. The prevalence of DDH was 23.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 19.4%, 28.5%); PPV&#x2009;=&#x2009;58.9% (48.9%, 68.3%); NPV&#x2009;=&#x2009;91.5% (87.3%, 94.7%), post-test disease likelihood despite negative test&#x2009;=&#x2009;8.5% (5.3%, 12.7%), sensitivity&#x2009;=&#x2009;75% (64.4%, 83.8%); specificity&#x2009;=&#x2009;83.7% (78.7%, 87.9%). Wrongly detected were leg length discrepancies (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;19), Ortolani (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;9), Barlow (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;10), and limited abduction (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;7). Excluding mild ultrasonic abnormalities from analysis gave a sensitivity of 91.1% and specificity of 83.7%.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The diagnostic aid was easy to use in routine clinical care. It demonstrated face, content, and criterion validity in the hands of family physicians.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> A new diagnostic aid has been developed and validated. It has the potential to enable family physicians or pediatricians to evaluate infants for DDH in a manner approaching the practice of orthopedic surgeons. The aid is currently evaluated in a randomized trial for its effectiveness.</p>

</p>
        <p>LOE-Therapeutic-Level II</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Worldwide controversy exists on the optimal treatment for stable dysplastic hips: abduction brace treatment or active surveillance by ultrasound imaging. This study aims to investigate the percentage of Graf IIb stable dysplastic hips that recover spontaneously without abduction brace treatment and to determine prognostic factors for spontaneous recovery.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A prospective cohort study was performed at the M&#xE1;xima Medical Center (Veldhoven, the Netherlands) between April 2018 and May 2023. Infants aged 90&#x2013;135&#x2009;days at the first outpatient clinic visit, diagnosed with Graf IIb hip dysplasia and a primary treatment of active surveillance with ultrasound imaging, were included. Ultrasonographic imaging was repeated after 6&#x2009;weeks. Spontaneous recovery was defined as an &#x3B1;-angle&#x2009;&#x2265;60&#x2009;degrees after 6&#x2009;weeks of active surveillance. In case of an &#x3B1;-angle&#x2009;&lt;60&#x2009;degrees, abduction brace treatment (Pavlik harness) was initiated. Baseline infant characteristics and ultrasound measurements were used as potential predictor variables for spontaneous recovery in univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 920 infants with hip dysplasia were part of the prospective cohort. Five-hundred seven infants were diagnosed with Graf IIb and had an initial treatment of 6&#x2009;weeks of active surveillance. This corresponds with 674 hips, as 167 infants had bilateral DDH. Spontaneous recovery of hip dysplasia was observed in 624 hips (92.6%) and in 468 infants (92.3%). Fifty hips (7.4%) and 39 infants (7.7%) did not recover spontaneously and needed additional abduction brace treatment. Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that a higher &#x3B1;-angle and first-born child were potential predictor variables for spontaneous recovery. In multivariate analysis, none of these parameters were significant predictor variables for spontaneous recovery.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Most of the Graf IIb stable dysplastic hips recover spontaneously in infants aged 90&#x2013;135&#x2009;days after 6&#x2009;weeks of active surveillance. This supports that infants with Graf IIb dysplastic hips do not routinely require therapeutic intervention. Reducing unnecessary abduction brace treatment may relieve the burden for the infant, parents, and healthcare system. Future research should focus on the long-term effects of active surveillance on residual dysplasia and the effect of abduction brace treatment after the age of 135&#x2009;days.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Regular abduction brace treatment for all Graf IIb dysplastic hips leads to an overtreatment of 92.6% of these hips. We recommend to initially observe all infants aged 90&#x2013;135&#x2009;days with Graf IIb dysplastic hips for 6&#x2009;weeks before starting abduction brace treatment.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> There is a lack of clarity regarding the optimum duration for following up children treated successfully for developmental dysplasia of the hip in a Pavlik harness. The purpose of this study was to examine whether children with normal clinical and radiological findings at 2&#x2009;years of age ever show deterioration by 5&#x2009;years of age.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Data were collected prospectively on all babies treated in Pavlik harness at our institution over an 18-month period, with follow-up to 5 years. Demographic, clinical, and radiological parameters were recorded. Standard anterior-posterior radiographs of both hips were taken at 1, 2, and 5&#x2009;years of age. A normal hip radiograph was defined as acetabular index (AI) within normal range adjusted for age, symmetrical and adequately sized ossific nuclei, and an International Hip Dysplasia Institute (IHDI) grade of 1; plus, a center-edge angle greater than 20&#xB0; on the radiograph taken at 5&#x2009;years of age.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> There were 170 hips (in 101 babies) successfully treated with a Pavlik harness and had radiographs available for analysis from three distinct time points of 1, 2, and 5&#x2009;years of age. Of these, 92% of hips were radiologically normal at 2&#x2009;years of age, and 100% were radiologically normal at 5&#x2009;years of age. Every child who had normal radiographs at age 2&#x2009;years had normal clinical and radiological examination at 5&#x2009;years, with none having any intervention.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This study supports the notion that, following successful treatment with Pavlik harness, it is safe to discharge at 2&#x2009;years of age.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Longer follow-up is not necessary if clinical and radiological parameters are normal at 2&#x2009;years of age. This new information can help with service planning.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> The treatment of developmental dysplasia of the hip varies worldwide. In 2021, the Dutch Orthopedic Society introduced a new national guideline on the treatment of stable hip dysplasia. Instead of abduction brace treatment, this guideline recommends to initially monitor all 3-month-old infants with stable hip dysplasia, called active surveillance. If the hip does not normalize ultrasonographically after 6&#x2013;12&#x2009;weeks, abduction brace treatment is started. This study compares the amount of residual dysplasia at 1-year follow-up in Graf IIb dysplastic hips treated with abduction brace versus active surveillance.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A cohort study was performed at the M&#xE1;xima Medical Center (Veldhoven, the Netherlands). Infants aged between 90 and 135&#x2009;days at the first outpatient clinic visit and diagnosed with Graf IIb hip dysplasia were included. We compared patients treated before and after the 2021 DDH guideline introduction. The first group of infants was treated with abduction brace treatment by a Pavlik harness after the first outpatient clinic visit between June 2016 and December 2017. The second group of infants was treated according to the active surveillance protocol between January and December 2021. Pelvic radiographs were routinely performed at 1&#x2009;year of age. The primary outcome was residual dysplasia, defined as an acetebular index (AI)&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;2 SD above the value expected for age, gender, and side as defined by T&#xF6;nnis.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 86 infants (95 hips) in the abduction brace treatment group and 109 infants (147 hips) in the active surveillance group were included. Residual dysplasia was observed in 9 infants (10.5%) and 10 hips (10.5%) in the abduction brace treatment group and in 14 infants (12.8%) and 17 hips (11.6%) in the active surveillance group. The mean AI was 24.6&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;4.0&#xB0; in the group that was immediately treated with a Pavlik harness and 24.7&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;3.8&#xB0; in the active surveillance group. No statistically significant difference was observed in residual dysplasia (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.257) and acetabular index (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.218) at 1&#x2009;year of age between the two different treatment strategies. The difference fell within a previously defined noninferiority margin of 10%.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This study shows that infants with Graf IIb stable dysplastic hips can safely be treated by active surveillance. At 1-year follow-up, the amount of residual dysplasia and mean AI is comparable between the group that received abduction brace treatment and the group that received active surveillance.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Active surveillance is a viable and safe treatment for Graf IIb stable dysplastic hips based on the 1-year follow-up results.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Infant hip dislocations benefit from early detection and treatment for optimal outcomes. Prior studies have identified wide variability in the success rate of bracing between institutions. While there are standardized methods to screen infants for hip dysplasia, there are no clear guidelines regarding how to image a child being treated for a hip dislocation with a Pavlik harness. As a result, there is substantial variability in how treatment success or failure is monitored between and within institutions. The purpose of this study was to determine if a standardized in-harness imaging protocol improves outcomes and the likelihood of successful treatment for dislocated hips being treated with the Pavlik harness.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> All patients with hip dislocations and pretreatment ultrasound (US) were included from July 2018 to July 2022. A new institutional US protocol was implemented in July 2020, during which standardized in-harness imaging was obtained for patients with hip dislocations. Patients treated before the implementation of standardized in-harness imaging were categorized as non-standardized and after implementation as a standardized group. Outcomes were compared between standardized and non-standardized groups. A p value&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05 determined the significance.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> One hundred twenty-eight hips met inclusion criteria (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;97 patients). The mean age at diagnosis was 41.6&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;23.4&#x2009;days and was predominantly female (85.6%). There was no significant difference between the patients&#x2019; demographics and baseline clinical characteristics between the standardized and nonstandardized groups. Pavlik&#x2019;s harness success rate was significantly higher in the standardized group (85% vs 63%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0058). Twenty-eight hips in the nonstandardized group remained dislocated. They were indicated for surgical treatment, while only eight hips remained dislocated in the standardized group and necessitated closed or open reduction.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These data suggest standardization of imaging for patients with hip dislocations undergoing Pavlik harness treatment may significantly improve the Pavlik harness success rate.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> The study included 128 hips from 97 patients over a 4-year period, implementing standardized imaging in July 2020. The results showed a significantly higher success rate (85% vs 63%) in the standardized group. This suggests that standardizing imaging protocols for Pavlik harness treatment can lead to improved success rates.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Pavlik harness is 90% successful in treating developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH). We present a case series of infantile dysplastic hips that initially failed Pavlik treatment but went on to successful reduction with a second round of brace treatment after a harness-free interval&#x2014;a &#x201C;Pavlik holiday.&#x201D;</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> We retrospectively identified patients with nonteratologic, dislocated hips that underwent a Pavlik holiday in a pediatric orthopedic tertiary care center. Hip dislocation was defined as a positive Ortolani sign and/or reduced femoral head coverage (FHC) (&lt;30%) on ultrasound. Hips that did not reduce after 3&#x2013;4&#x2009;weeks of full-time Pavlik treatment were instructed to discontinue the Pavlik harness for a period, a &#x201C;Pavlik holiday,&#x201D; after which it was reinstituted full time. Hips were reassessed clinically and radiographically every 2&#x2013;3&#x2009;weeks during the second trial of bracing prior to considering reduction of the hip in the operating room. Success was defined as hips that reduced with a second round of Pavlik harness treatment and did not require closed or open reduction in the operating room. Mann&#x2013;Whitney and Fisher&#x2019;s exact tests compared age, clinical features, ultrasound measurements, and length of time in-harness or on Pavlik holiday between successful and unsuccessful patients.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Twenty-one hips from 16 patients (13 female, 3 male) were given a Pavlik holiday after initial harness treatment failed to reduce the hip. Eleven (52%) hips successfully reduced during a second round of Pavlik treatment following the holiday. Median age at initial Pavlik application was 5.9&#x2009;weeks (range 0.9&#x2013;13.9). All hips were dislocated on initial ultrasound (median %FHC 15, alpha angle 49), and 13 were Ortolani-positive. The first round of Pavlik treatment lasted for a median of 22&#x2009;days in the successful group and 27.5&#x2009;days for the unsuccessful group (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.096). Median holiday duration was 28&#x2009;days (range 8&#x2013;67). Median duration of the second Pavlik treatment was 65&#x2009;days in the successful group with final %FHC of 60.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> A &#x201C;Pavlik holiday&#x201D; rescued approximately half of dislocated hips that failed a first round of treatment. Future investigations will focus on risk factors for failing Pavlik treatment and predictive factors for success of the &#x201C;Pavlik holiday.&#x201D;</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> We have demonstrated a 50% success rate with a second Pavlik harness trial following initial unsuccessful reduction. This can be implemented while patients wait until they are large enough to undergo spica casting and therefore has the potential to avoid more invasive intervention without delaying care.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Successful bracing for developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) in infancy is characterized by normal clinical examination and hip ultrasound at the end of treatment. However, radiographic residual acetabular dysplasia (RAD) has been reported in up to 30% of children who had DDH treated in infancy. It is important to predict those that will resolve and those that may need corrective surgery to optimize efficient follow-up protocols. We therefore aimed to identify the prevalence and predictors of RAD at 2&#x2009;years and 5&#x2009;years after bracing and identify factors that predicted spontaneous resolution.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> This was a single-center, prospective longitudinal cohort study of infants with DDH managed using a published, standardized Pavlik harness protocol between 2012 and 2016. RAD was measured at a mean follow-up of 2&#x2009;years using acetabular index-lateral edge (AI-L) and acetabular index-sourcil (AI-S). At 5&#x2009;years, RAD was measured using AI-L, AI-S, center-edge angle (CEA), and acetabular depth ratio (ADR). At both timepoints, each hip was classified based on published normative values for normal, borderline (1&#x2013;2 SD), or dysplastic (&gt;2 SD) based on sex, age, and laterality.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Of 202 infants that completed the protocol, 181 (90%) had 2- and 5-year follow-up radiographs. At 2&#x2009;years, in 304 initially pathologic hips, based on AI-L and AI-S, the prevalence of RAD (dysplasia) was 10%, and RAD (borderline) was 30%. At 5&#x2009;years, RAD (dysplasia) based on any measure decreased to 1%&#x2013;3%, and RAD (borderline) decreased to&#x2009;&lt;1%&#x2013;2%. On logistic regression, no variables were predictive of RAD at 2&#x2009;years. Only AI-L at 2&#x2009;years was predictive of persistent RAD at 5&#x2009;years (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Heat mapping of hips at 2 and 5&#x2009;years showed that if both hips were normal at 2-year follow-up (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;96), all remained normal at 5&#x2009;years. In those with bilateral borderline hips at 2&#x2009;years (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;21), only two were borderline at 5 years, none were dysplastic. In those with either borderline-dysplastic or bilateral dysplasia at 2&#x2009;years (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;26), three (12%) had dysplasia at 5&#x2009;years.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The vast majority of RAD at 2&#x2009;years after brace treatment spontaneously resolved by 5-year follow-up without surgical intervention. Children with normal radiographs at 2&#x2009;years after brace treatment can be discharged from care. Targeted follow-up for those with abnormal AI-L at 2&#x2009;years will identify those few that may benefit from surgical correction at 5-year follow-up.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Our evidence-based pragmatic approach to DDH follow-up will inform efficient follow-up protocols and reduce unnecessary exposure to radiography.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> This study aims to report on the acetabular indices of walking age children following successful DDH treatment with Pavlik harness and investigate risk factors for residual acetabular dysplasia (RAD).</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> We retrospectively reviewed the data for children treated for DDH at a single center between 2015 and 2020. Acetabular indices (AI) measured on pelvic radiographs taken at 2- and 4-year follow-up visits were referenced against age- and sex-matched normal data. Values above the 90th percentile were considered to represent RAD.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 305 children (256:49&#x2009;F:M) with 470 successfully treated hips were suitable for inclusion. Mean age at treatment initiation was 7.0&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;4.5&#x2009;weeks, and mean treatment duration was 15.9&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;4.3&#x2009;weeks. Of the 470, 27% and 19% of hips were found to have RAD at 2-year (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;448, mean age 26&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;3&#x2009;months) and 4-year (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;208, mean age 44&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;6&#x2009;months) follow-up, respectively. The chi-square test for independence demonstrated the relationship between age and incidence of RAD was significant (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.032). Patients with RAD at 2 years were found to have been treated for longer (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.028) and had lower alpha angles on final ultrasound assessment (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Patients with RAD at 4 years were older at initiation of treatment (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.041), had lower alpha angles on final ultrasound assessment (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001), and were more likely to have had RAD at 2 years (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Multivariate analysis identified lower alpha angles on final ultrasound to be the only predictor for RAD at 2 years (odds ratio (OR) 1.08, 95% CI 1.02&#x2013;1.14, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.011), and presence of RAD at 2 years to be the only predictor for RAD at 4 years (OR 18.4, 95% CI 6.3&#x2013;54.2, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The risk of RAD beyond walking age in children successfully treated with Pavlik harness is not negligible. However, we observed that a significant proportion of children with RAD at 2-year follow-up had spontaneously improved without any intervention.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> These data suggest that routine long-term radiological follow-up of children treated with Pavlik harness is necessary. Based on our findings, we would recommend delaying surgical intervention to address RAD until at least 4 years of age.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Reorientation of the acetabulum might be indicated to achieve a concentric and stable hip in children with developmental hip dysplasia. This study describes the long-term results after Salter pelvic osteotomies at our institution.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Between 1981 and 2002, 99 Salter osteotomies have been performed at our institution in 76 patients without underlying neuromuscular pathology. Patients underwent a physical examination, clinical assessment was performed by Harris Hip Score (HHS), the Oxford score, and Visual Acuity Score (VAS), and patients had pelvic radiographs taken.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Two patients (three hips) were excluded, and 15 patients (19 hips) were lost to follow-up. The median follow-up was 22&#x2009;years (range 13&#x2013;34&#x2009;years). A total hip arthroplasty (THA) was performed in 6 out of 77 hips (8%). There was a significantly higher rate of AVN in the population of children undergoing a Salter with an open reduction (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). There were statistically significant differences in the group with and without AVN regarding HHS (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.006), Oxford hip score (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.016), Modified Oxford hip score (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.018), VAS score in activity (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.046), and VAS score satisfaction (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.005).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The rate of THA was 8% at follow-up. Secondary results suggest that AVN occurs more frequently when a Salter osteotomy is combined with an open reduction. When AVN occurs, clinical outcome scores and patient satisfaction are significantly lower and pain scores are significantly higher. If there is no AVN and a well-reduced hip can be achieved, good clinical results can be expected at a long-term follow-up.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This study further emphasizes the sustained effect of the Salter innominate osteotomy in children with developmental dysplasia of the hip. It can also help us counsel patients better about the long-term consequences of the condition and the surgery.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> The goal in treating developmental dislocation of the hip is to establish a stable, congruent, and concentric motion between the growing components of the joint: while minimizing complications. While nonoperative treatments are preferred, there are instances where brace treatment is impractical due to age constraints or ineffectiveness. In such cases, closed reduction has classically been considered the next line of treatment. This is a retrospective analysis of a consecutive single-surgeon series, aimed to evaluate midterm outcomes for patients who underwent closed reduction for developmental hip dislocation.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> This is a retrospective review of 103 hips that underwent closed reduction. The mean age at the time of reduction was 10.3&#x2009;months, and the minimum follow-up was 6&#x2009;years, with a mean of 7.4&#x2009;years. To assess outcomes, we employed the Severin classification for radiographic results and determined the rates of proximal femoral growth disturbance and the necessity for secondary procedures.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Of the 103 patients who underwent closed reduction, 44% (45 hips) achieved Severin types 1 or 2, while 49% (50 hips) ended as Severin types 3 or 4. We found a redislocation rate of 7% (7 hips). We identified proximal femoral growth disturbance in 19% (20 hips) of cases, and we found that 50% (52 hips) required a secondary intervention. Notably, for patients who transitioned to closed reduction following unsuccessful brace treatment, our findings were striking. In this cohort, comprising seven patients who failed with the Pavlik method and subsequently underwent closed reduction, five of the 7 exhibited proximal femoral growth disturbance, and six required further surgical intervention.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our series found the likelihood of requiring a secondary procedure after a closed reduction in the treatment of developmental dislocation of the hip to be high and the risk of presenting PFGD to be significant. It also underscores that closed reduction after failed brace treatment carried a notably high risk of proximal femoral growth disturbance and the subsequent need for additional surgery.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> While prioritizing nonsurgical options as a first-line treatment is a prudent approach, it is equally vital to provide parents with comprehensive information about potential treatment options and their associated outcomes.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Outcomes after early closed reduction of developmental dysplasia of hip (DDH) are occasionally unpredictable. Here, we develop a clinical model depicting age-specific risk profiles, to guide clinical decisions in optimizing long-term outcomes.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Children with DDH at two tertiary pediatric orthopedic centers over a 53-year-period with minimum follow-up until skeletal maturity were examined. Only hips that underwent closed reduction before 2&#x2009;years of age were included. Those with open reduction, neuromuscular disorders, collagenopathies, chromosomal, or syndromic disorders were excluded. Radiographs since birth were retrieved with assessment of Tonnis grading, acetabular index (AI), lateral center edge angle, proximal femoral growth disturbance acetabular angle, and Severin grading. Primary outcomes involve development of a prognostication model to predict risk of good (Severin grades I or II) or poor (Severin grades III or above) hip outcomes. Secondary outcomes involved differences in hip outcomes with reference to age-specific acetabular indices, proximal femoral growth disturbance, initial Tonnis grading, gender, and age of reduction.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 2068 radiographs from 101 hips were analyzed. Mean follow-up was 19.2&#x2009;years, with maximal follow-up at 46&#x2009;years. The mean age at reduction was 9&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;7&#x2009;months. Femoral osteotomies were later performed in 14 hips, while pelvic osteotomies were performed in six hips (2 Salters, 1 Dega, 1 triple, and 2 shelf procedures). Hip arthroplasty was performed in one patient at follow-up of 46&#x2009;years. Eight-two percent of hips experienced good Severin outcomes. Proximal femoral growth disturbance was present in 13%. Acetabular angle at latest follow-up (before triple, shelf, and arthroplasty) was 45&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;4&#x2009;degrees, with lateral center edge angle of 25&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;8&#x2009;degrees. Children with poor outcomes had higher AI across all ages (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01). Prereduction AI is a strong predictor of poor long-term outcome at skeletal maturity, with area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.843 (95% CI 0.788&#x2013;0.898, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01). Prereduction AI exceeding 33&#x2009;degrees predicts poor outcome with 87% specificity and 62% sensitivity. Reduction after 3&#x2009;months of age (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.035) and growth disturbance (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01) were also predictive of poorer long-term outcomes. Earlier reduction before 6&#x2009;months (6% vs 27%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.016) was associated with decreased risk of future surgery.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Closed reduction before 6&#x2009;months of age is associated with decreased risk of future surgery. Prereduction AI of over 33&#x2009;degrees at any age is associated with poor outcomes.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> A personalized risk assessment chart visualizes our model developed from support vector machine algorithm, with age and AI as axis variables, attaining an accuracy of 84%.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> This study aims to compare acetabular remodeling following closed and open reduction for developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH).</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> This is a three-center, institutional review board (IRB)-approved study. We identified 538 hips from 459 patients aged 0&#x2013;24&#x2009;months who underwent an isolated closed or open reduction for DDH between 2000 and 2018. Serial radiographs were reviewed, and acetabular index (AI) measurements were assessed at follow-up visits. Only the initial hip treated per patient was analyzed. General additive modeling evaluated acetabular remodeling&#x2019;s temporal shape and extent by treatment group and patient sex. AI measurements for males and females were compared to age-specific normative AI values throughout follow-up. Multivariable logistic regression identified factors associated with failure to remodel within normal limits by age 4.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Thirty-six percent (166/459) underwent open reduction, while 64% (293/459) underwent closed reduction. Hips undergoing open reduction were slightly older (mean age 10.4 vs 8.9&#x2009;months; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002), with a higher proportion of IHDI grade-4 (41% vs 15%; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Patients were followed up until they reached an endpoint (additional intervention or last radiographic follow-up) for a median of 5&#x2009;years (IQR, 4.4&#x2013;6.7&#x2009;years). AI remodeling showed no significant difference over time across reduction groups (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.90). However, IHDI grade-4 hips treated with closed reduction displayed poorer remodeling patterns than IHDI grade-4 hips undergoing open reduction (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001; Figure 1). By age 4, 66% (303/459) of the cohort achieved correction within 95% of the normal AI range. Multivariable analysis revealed that each additional year of age at reduction increased the odds of not remodeling within normal limits by 2.6 times (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.57; 95% CI, 1.35&#x2013;4.87; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.004). Patients with IHDI grade-4 (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.12; 95% CI, 1.21&#x2013;3.69; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.008) and males (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.12; 95% CI, 1.06&#x2013;4.22; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.03) were less likely to remodel to normal AI by age 4. In addition, each additional degree of prereduction AI increased the odds of not remodeling by 15% (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.15; 95% CI, 1.09&#x2013;1.20; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Overall, no significant difference in AI improvement rate was observed between hips undergoing closed or open reduction within the first 9&#x2009;years postreduction. However, IHDI grade-4 hips treated with closed reduction exhibited less favorable remodeling patterns than those with open reduction. Furthermore, older age at reduction, IHDI grade-4, male sex, and more severe preoperative AI were independent factors associated with failure to remodel within normal limits by age 4.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This comprehensive analysis of 459 hips presents significant implications for clinical decision-making in DDH treatment, particularly for IHDI grade-4 hips. While both closed and open reduction have comparable remodeling for lower-grade cases, our results suggest considering open reduction for IHDI grade-4 hips to achieve superior acetabular remodeling.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Triradiate cartilage (TRC) plays a pivotal role in assessing the maturation status of patients undergoing scoliosis treatment to determine risk for curve progression. Our hypothesis posits that the closure of the TRC marks the initial peak in curve progression among patients with juvenile idiopathic scoliosis (JIS). Our primary objective is to investigate whether the status of the TRC can function as an independent radiographic parameter, assessing its relationship with curve progression.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> We conducted a longitudinal evaluation of 185 individuals diagnosed with JIS, comprising 126 girls and 59 boys, with an average age of 9.7&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1.5&#x2009;years. These patients, all initially presenting with open-TRC, eventually underwent surgery during adolescence. Serial radiographs were utilized to monitor their progress, with an average follow-up period of 7.7&#x2009;years. The TRC was categorized into three distinct statuses: (1) open-TRC: the TRC remained unfused. (2) Closing-TRC: a nonfused remnant was visualized. (3) Closed-TRC: the TRC was no longer visible, occurring prior to the initial appearance of the Risser sign. For each stage, we measured the main Cobb angles and calculated the curve progression rate per month. Subsequently, we correlated the TRC status with curve progression.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> The average duration for the closing-TRC was 1.1&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;0.5&#x2009;years, occurring between the ages of 11.2&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;0.9 and 12.3&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1.1&#x2009;years in girls. In contrast, boys experienced a longer period for the closing-TRC, spanning from the age of 13&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1.1 to 14.4&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1.1&#x2009;years, which was 1.8 to 2.1&#x2009;years later than girls. During the closing-TRC phase, curve progression exhibited distinct patterns. In girls, it averaged 1.4&#xB0;&#xB1;&#x2009;1.0 per month, while in boys, it was slightly lower at 1.3&#xB0;&#xB1;&#x2009;0.8 per month. These rates were significantly higher than those observed during the open-TRC phase (0.5&#xB0;&#xB1;&#x2009;0.5 per month in girls and 0.3&#xB0;&#xB1;&#x2009;0.7 per month in boys) (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001). The duration of the closed-TRC phase until the appearance of the Risser sign was 9.2&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;5.0&#x2009;months in girls, while in boys, it was notably shorter, at 0.8&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;4.6&#x2009;months.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our findings indicate that scoliotic curves in association with a closing-TRC exhibited significantly greater progression than those with an open TRC. The presence of a closing-TRC serves as a valuable indicator, signifying a critical period of scoliosis progression.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> The closing-TRC may prove particularly valuable in guiding treatment decisions, especially in cases with borderline indications for the management of JIS.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Early-onset scoliosis (EOS) can result in thoracic insufficiency syndrome (TIS), leading to significant morbidity or early mortality primarily attributable to restrictive lung disease. Growth-friendly EOS surgery can control curve progression and sustain growth until adequate thoracic height is achieved to avoid TIS. The traditional T1&#x2013;T12 measurement of spine growth on coronal radiographs overlooks out-of-plane increases in spine length leading to an underestimation of the growth effects of surgical interventions. Sagittal spine length (SSL) measured from T1&#x2009;L1 has been validated to reliably assess the length of the thoracic spine along the sagittal arc of curvature and account for this deficiency. Pulmonary function tests (PFTs), specifically forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1&#x2009;second (FEV1), and FEV1/FVC are recommended for EOS patients prior to and following surgical intervention, but it is unknown how these correlate to SSL.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> This was a multicenter retrospective review of data collected prospectively. EOS patients with both postdefinitive fusion radiographs and PFT data available, excluding neuromuscular and syndromic etiologies, had SSL measured (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;49). Pearson correlations between PFT data and SSL were analyzed.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Actual FEV1 and actual FVC had statistically significant positive correlations with SSL (FEV1 r&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.334, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.007; FVC r&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.331, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.008). FEV1 predicted, FVC predicted, and FEV1/FVC ratio did not have a statistically significant correlation with SSL. Linear regression models were also built for pulmonary function variables with statistically significant correlations to further describe the relationships with SSL.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This study confirms the hypothesis that a positive correlation exists between SSL and postoperative FEV1a and FVC. Because of the statistically significant correlations between SSL and PFTs, SSL can be used as a predictive measure of pulmonary function following definitive fusion.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Further long-term PFT follow-up evaluation of a larger population of postdefinitive fusion EOS patients has potential to clarify a definitive ideal thoracic length as measured by SSL which is preventive of the disabling complication of TIS.</p>

        <p>LOE-Therapeutic-Level IV</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> The evolution of magnetically controlled growing rod (MCGR) technique has led to modifications in the configuration of the proximal construct to decrease the incidence of implant-related complications (IRCs) and revision surgeries. However, there are no data characterizing the performance of the most used configurations reducing risk of complications.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A total of 487 patients were identified from an international multicenter EOS database. Inclusion criteria were EOS patients, primary dual MCGR, age&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;9&#x2009;years, complete radiographs, and minimum of 2&#x2009;years in follow-up. Seventy-six patients had incomplete x-rays, five had apical fusions, and 18 had inconclusive complications status leaving 388 patients for review. A digital spine template was created to document UIV; number of levels; number, type, and location of anchors; as well as implant configuration. We reviewed the first available postoperative and latest follow-up radiographs by a group of two senior surgeons and two spine fellows. Unplanned return to the operating room (UPROR) due to IRC was defined as any change in proximal anchors between the postoperative and final follow-up radiographs.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> The most common proximal construct configuration: UIV at T2 (50.0%) with 17.5% UPROR, followed by T3 (34.0%) with 12.1% UPROR; number of levels was 3 (57.1%) with 16.8% UPROR, and 2 (26.0%) with 17.0% UPROR; number of proximal anchors was 6 (49.9%) with 14.1% UPROR, and 4 (27.0%) with 18.3% UPROR. The most common types of anchors were all screws (42.0%) with 9.9% UPROR, and all hooks (26.4%) with 31.4% UPROR (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). The most protective construct (nine cases) was UIV at T3 across three levels with six anchors, screws, and hooks (0% UPROR) followed by UIV at T3, across three levels (28 cases) with six anchors, hooks (7.1% UPROR). The most common construct (46 cases) was UIV at T3, with six anchors, screws (17.4% UPROR).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Proximal anchor configuration impacts the incidence of implant-related UPROR in MCGR. The most protective (T3 UIV, 3 levels, 6 anchors, screws, and hooks) was used in only 2.3% of cases.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Proximal construct configuration, including the upper instrumented vertebra (UIV), the number of foundational levels, and the number and type of anchors, is an important factor affecting the outcomes of MCGR. We found that the most utilized configurations are not the most protective against UPROR.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Over the last decade, enabling technology has shown promise in enhancing construct placement accuracy and reducing complications in spine surgery. However, its role in growth-friendly spine surgery remains underexplored.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> In this retrospective single-center cohort study, patients were included if they had a diagnosis of early-onset scoliosis (EOS) and underwent instrumented growth-friendly surgery with traditional growing rods (TGRs) or magnetically controlled growing rods (MCGRs) from 2013 to 2023. Those with a history of prior spine surgery were excluded. Key metrics including proximal anchor density (defined as the number of anchors per vertebral level), proximal fixation failure rates, operative time, and unplanned returns to the operating room were compared between ET patients and non-ET patients using <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-tests, Wilcoxon rank sum tests, or Fisher&#x2019;s exact tests.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Of the 123 eligible patients (48% female), 34 received enabling technology assistance, primarily via CT-based O-arm guidance (one case utilized both O-arm and robotic guidance), while 89 underwent traditional fluoroscopic surgery. The mean age at the index surgery was 7.4&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;2.8&#x2009;years, average follow-up was 51&#x2009;months, and average body mass index (BMI) was 16.4&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;2.7. Preoperative Cobb angles averaged 77.4&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;23.9 (major) and 43.2&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;17.6 (minor). ET-assisted patients had a significantly higher screw-based proximal anchor density (1.3 vs 0.0, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) but longer operative times (374&#x2009;mins vs 272&#x2009;mins, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). There were no significant differences in proximal fixation failure rates (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.5) or unplanned returns to the operating room (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.6). ET use was found to be increasing over the past decade.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Enabling technology in growth-friendly pediatric spine deformity surgery increased screw-based anchor density and higher operative times but did not significantly alter proximal fixation failure rates or unplanned revisions in this cohort.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This study fills a critical knowledge gap in understanding the impact of enabling technology in growth-friendly spine surgery for pediatric spine deformities, offering insights into its potential benefits and areas for improvement.</p>

        <p>LOE-Therapeutic-Level II</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Early-onset scoliosis (EOS) is a progressive, life-threatening condition that needs to be treated carefully. Treatment with growing rods (GR) is the most frequently preferred method and is usually followed by posterior instrumentation and fusion (PIF), which is also called graduation. Graduation surgery is technically demanding and complicated, leading to a preference for avoiding definitive fusion when there&#x2019;s adequate improvement in scoliosis angle, no implant failure, and no need to change instrumentation level. The aim of this study is to compare the risks and benefits of instrumented posterior fusion between patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) treated with standard PIF and patients with idiopathic EOS treated with GR and graduated with PIF.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> This is a retrospective study, included patients with idiopathic EOS who underwent dual-GR and definitive surgery, as well as those who underwent standard PIF with AIS during the study period. The AIS and the EOS groups were matched in terms of angle, T2&#x2013;T12 kyphosis, L1&#x2009;S1 lordosis, gender, and age variables by Propensity Score Matching analysis (Method nearest 1:3).</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> One hundred seventy-six patients (24 EOS, 152 AIS) were included in the study. Seventy-two AIS patients were matched against 24 EOS patients. Statistically significant differences were found between the groups in terms of scoliosis correction percentage, surgery time, transfusion need, and number of instrumented segments. The percentage of T1&#x2013;T12 increase, percentage of T1&#x2009;S1 increase, instrumented spinal segment length increase, and the estimated blood loss (EBL) were similar (Table 1). Complications were seen in six patients in the EOS group. Intraoperative neuromonitoring alerts were seen in two patients, but both resolved with appropriate interventions. One superior mesenteric artery syndrome, two proximal anchor pull-outs, and one superficial infection were recorded. In the AIS group, three patients had complications (one trunk shift, one screw malpositioning, and one shoulder instability) and had to undergo revision surgery.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Although the EOS group had longer surgical time (53&#x2009;minutes more), more bleeding (125 cc more), and less correction of the coronal deformity, trunk height gained by definitive surgery was the same as the AIS group. There is a difference in favor of AIS between the groups in terms of coronal deformity correction rates, but the final deformity size in EOS patients was clinically insignificant (20&#xB0; (13&#x2013;34)).</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> In conclusion, definitive fusion in EOS with idiopathic etiology does not carry an excessive risk for complications, and the gains obtained by the patients at the end of surgery are remarkable.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> The use of Vertical Expandable Prosthetic Titanium Rib (VEPTR) for treating early-onset scoliosis (EOS) has markedly declined. At the verge of the VEPTR era, we assessed 20&#x2009;years of this device&#x2019;s outcomes, encompassing coronal correction, spine growth height, pulmonary function, complication rates, and the impact on health-related quality of life (HRQoL). We analyzed all EOS patients from the Pediatric Spine Study Group (PSSG) registry who were treated initially with VEPTR and followed up for at least 5 years.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> We examined demographic and radiographic parameters, pulmonary function tests, 24-Item Early Onset Scoliosis Questionnaire (EOSQ-24) findings, and complications of all the patients from the PSSG database who underwent VEPTR instrumentation with a minimum of 5 years of follow-up.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 447 patients with a mean age of 4.24&#x2009;+&#x2009;2.62&#x2009;years; 51.0% male were included. Fifty percent had congenital scoliosis, followed by neuromuscular (27.5%), syndromic (11.9%), and idiopathic etiologies (10.3%). Of these, 213 patients had at least one comorbidity. Thoracic insufficiency syndrome was the most common comorbidity. Five years after the initial surgery, 237 patients continued with VEPTR, 186 were fused, and 24 required hardware removal. Initial mean body mass index was 16.40&#x2009;+&#x2009;2.68 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; most recent was 17.42&#x2009;+&#x2009;4.08 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Preoperative coronal Cobb angle was 66.94&#x2009;+&#x2009;23.59&#xB0;; most recent was 56.71&#x2009;+&#x2009;18.85&#xB0; (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Preoperative sagittal Cobb angle was 46.73&#x2009;+&#x2009;7.62&#xB0;; most recent was 53.95&#x2009;+&#x2009;22.85&#xB0; (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). The T1&#x2009;S1 spine height increased from 232.99&#x2009;+&#x2009;47.93&#x2009;mm to 297.54&#x2009;+&#x2009;63.47&#x2009;mm (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), T1&#x2013;T12 height changed from 141.63&#x2009;+&#x2009;33.87&#x2009;mm to 188.33&#x2009;+&#x2009;43.35&#x2009;mm (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), and L1&#x2009;S1 height went from 90.56&#x2009;+&#x2009;20.19&#x2009;mm to 109.63&#x2009;+&#x2009;24.47&#x2009;mm (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). During the follow-up period, 82 patients underwent pulmonary function testing. Forced vital capacity (FVC) diminished from 61.92&#x2009;+&#x2009;31.58% to 46.84&#x2009;+&#x2009;20.18% (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) decreased from 85.53&#x2009;+&#x2009;148.22 to 47.98&#x2009;+&#x2009;22.12 (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.004). EOSQ-24 scores (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;238) changed from 71.92&#x2009;+&#x2009;18.95 to 73.17&#x2009;+&#x2009;19.24 (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.328). Seventy-two percent of patients had postoperative complications (336/447). Evaluation between all EOS categories showed better results in congenital scoliosis.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> We present the most extensive sample of VEPTR utilization in the literature. The VEPTR&#x2019;s objectives were to improve coronal deformity, stimulate spine growth, and hold respiratory function deterioration. Our results indicate that the first two objectives were achieved. However, the VEPTR technique could not prevent worsening of respiratory function. Similarly, no improvement in HRQoL was observed. Although we acknowledge the limitations of analyzing limited PFT/EOSQ data, it is important to highlight the trend observed in both parameters.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Due to high complication rates, we should continue to seek alternative treatments for EOS.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Twenty-four-Item Early Onset Scoliosis Questionnaire (EOSQ-24) is a parent proxy questionnaire designed to assess the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of early-onset scoliosis (EOS) patients during their childhood years. EOSQ-SELF, a novel self-reported questionnaire, assesses HRQoL in older children (&gt;8&#x2009;years) and adolescents. So far, the same group of EOS patients has not been evaluated with both EOSQ-24 and EOSQ-SELF. The aim of this study was to evaluate how the same pathology was reflected in the parent and patient at different time points by comparing the answers to the common questions between EOSQ-24 and EOSQ-SELF.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A group of otherwise healthy idiopathic/idiopathic-like EOS patients whose parents filled out EOSQ-24 at the initiation of growth-friendly treatment was re-tested by the EOSQ-SELF questionnaire at the end of treatment. Both EOSQ-24 and EOSQ-SELF are validated in Turkish. Inclusion criteria were patients with EOS, independent ambulation, age over 8&#x2009;years, literacy in Turkish, no apparent intellectual impairment, and minimum 24&#x2009;months after graduation surgery. The common questions between the two surveys with nearly identical phrasings were extracted. Common items from the two tests were compared with a Wilcoxon signed rank test.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Twenty-one patients (15 females, 6 males) who previously filled out EOSQ-24 met the inclusion criteria. The mean age of the group was 10.0 (5&#x2013;16) years at EOSQ-24 participation and 18.0 (13&#x2013;24) at the final analysis. There were nine congenital (40.9%), five juvenile idiopathic (22.7%), two low-tone neuromuscular scolioses (9.0%), two spina bifida (9.0%), one mucopolysaccharidosis (4.5%), one arthrogryposis (4.5%), and one secondary to a neuroblastoma resection (4.5%). Four patients had magnetically controlled (18.1%) and 17 had traditional growing rod instrumentation (77.2%). The mean number of surgeries was 10.2 (1&#x2013;22). There were five cases of rod breakage (22.7%), two screw loosening (9.0%), two pullout (9.0%), and one infection (4.5%) that underwent revision. Ten patients graduated with definitive surgery (47.6%) and 11 graduated without (52.3%). Fourteen questions were found common in 10 domains (Table 1). The scores were significantly different in five questions of four domains. EOSQ-SELF had significantly less favorable scores in the pain/discomfort, pulmonary function, and fatigue/energy level domains, and scores in the parental burden/relationships domain were significantly higher (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> There was a general trend of worse results in the self-reported group. These findings suggest either parents or caregivers may not accurately perceive the problems of EOS patients, or EOSQ-24 may fail to demonstrate some challenges faced by patients over the treatment process.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> First study to compare answers to similar questionnaires between the patients and proxies.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Previous literature has demonstrated the need for adequate preoperative screening, including echocardiograms, to assess intraoperative risks in cases of severe scoliosis. However, in a relatively healthy population of patients with no prior cardiac history, the benefit of a screening echocardiogram is unclear. The purpose of this study is to quantify the incidence of cardiac findings in patients undergoing screening echocardiography based solely on curve magnitude, specifically those patients with curves&#x2009;&#x2265;90&#xB0;.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A single-institution retrospective chart review was performed ranging from 2018 to 2023. Inclusion criteria were patients with scoliosis curves&#x2009;&#x2265;90&#xB0; undergoing screening echocardiogram within 6 months of a surgical spine procedure. Exclusion criteria were patients with diagnoses associated with cardiac anomalies or dysfunction, previous cardiac history, or any patients with a primary sagittal plane deformity.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Fifty patients met the inclusion criteria and were included in the study. The mean age at surgery was 14.0&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;4.9&#x2009;years. The mean magnitude of the major curve was 108&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;18.7. Seventy-six percent of the patients had a normal echocardiogram, of which 33% were technically challenging to obtain. Abnormal findings were seen in 24% (Table 1) and included mild valvular regurgitation and dilation. No patient had their anesthetic plan modified. Only one patient was recommended to follow up with cardiology postoperatively, and their surgery went without complication. In terms of postoperative cardiac events, 42 (84.0%) of the patients had none. Eight patients (14.0%) were given vasopressors to increase mean arterial pressure to protect spinal cord function after significant intraoperative blood loss and/or changes in spinal cord monitoring. Cardiac dysfunction was not felt to be a contributing factor in any of these cases, and only one of these eight patients had positive findings on echocardiogram.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Echocardiograms were performed on patients with severe scoliosis, but no underlying cardiac history, cardiac symptoms, or diagnosis associated with cardiac comorbidities did not help in quantifying perioperative risk. Results were hard to interpret in one-fourth of the studies and did not produce actionable findings or contribute to anesthetic management.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Our study suggests screening echocardiograms in patients without any cardiac history, symptoms, or a diagnosis with a known association with cardiac comorbidities has low utility in this patient population. Creating clear, evidenced-based indications for screening exams, like echocardiograms, is important to assess preoperative risk responsibly and help minimize the scheduling, psycho-social, and financial burdens endured by families in this population.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> In the past, pedicle screw insertion had been done using free-hand technique or fluoroscopy guidance. Recently, intraoperative CT-based navigation has been adopted to aid in visualization of pedicle screw insertion to allow for screw accuracy and safety in spine surgery. Albeit the safety benefits of this new technology, it runs the risk of increasing radiation exposure in this vulnerable population.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective chart review of 596 AIS patients between 2015 and 2023 from a single institution was done. One hundred ten patients were operated on with just CT-based technology (CT-nav group), 268 patients were operated on using fluoroscopy guidance, and 218 patients were operated on utilizing a hybrid, TNT (technique n&#x2019; technology), approach. Surgical and clinical outcomes were compared. Kruskal&#x2013;Wallis test was done for continuous variables, and chi-square test was done for categorical variables.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> There were no significant differences in demographic or radiographic variables. CT-nav and TNT had a significantly higher radiation dose than fluoroscopy (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), Ct-nav has the highest radiation dose at 21.2 mGy. CT-nav also had the highest time under radiation at 21.6 seconds (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Operative time in this group was significantly higher than that in the other two groups, taking 278.5&#x2009;minutes to complete surgery (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> New technology in the medical field comes with advantages as well as disadvantages. In this case, CT-based technology can give surgeons confidence in their screw placement, creating a safer and more accurate procedure; however, the added radiation and operative time is harmful for adolescents.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Intraoperative CT-based technology leads to an increase in harmful radiation exposure in adolescents during spine surgery. This technology should be further explored.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> In the face of the opiate epidemic, there is a directive to decrease opiate consumption in pediatric patients after surgery. At our institution, liposomal bupivacaine, delivered via erector spinae plane block (ESPB) prior to surgery, has been found to be an effective pain-controlling adjunct. Due to improved pain control with ESPB, our institution replaced patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) with as-needed intravenous and oral analgesia. This study was performed to compare opiate consumption, postoperative pain scores, length of stay (LOS), and mobility in patients treated with a PCA to those without PCA.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Retrospective chart review of consecutive patients undergoing posterior spinal fusion (PSF) for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) was performed. Pain control in both cohorts involved an ESPB with liposomal bupivacaine prior to incision and postoperative oral oxycodone, ketorolac, and gabapentin. The PCA group received 2 days of IV hydromorphone via the PCA. The non-PCA group instead received as-needed IV hydromorphone. Opioid consumption was measured via morphine milligram equivalents (MME). Pain scores were measured via the Visual Acuity Score (VAS). Patient mobility was measured by steps taken. These were measured by function of postoperative day from surgery (POD). Statistical analysis was performed using one-way analysis of variance and chi-square tests.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Seventy-two consecutive patients undergoing PSF were reviewed. There were 36 patients in the PCA cohort and 36 in the non-PCA cohort. Patients were comparable in baseline characteristics in terms of age, gender, weight, blood loss, and number of levels fused (p&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.05). The non-PCA group had significant lower MME at each point after surgery, most notably at POD-0 (18.4 vs 54.9, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01), POD-1 (28.8 vs 64.6, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01), and POD-2 (30.4 vs 47.2, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01) and throughout the entire hospital stay (99.8 vs 200.7, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). Postoperative pain scores were no different at POD-0 (4.9 vs 4.8, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.9), POD-1 (5.1 vs 5.2, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.7), and POD 3 (4.3 vs 5.1, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.4). There was a significant difference at POD-2, with the PCA cohort having more pain (6.0 vs 4.6, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02). There was no difference in mobility between the cohorts (p&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.05). The non-PCA patients had a lower LOS (3.7 vs 4.1, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In patients undergoing scoliosis surgery with ESPB, removal of the PCA reduced opiate consumption by half and lowered length of stay without any change in postoperative pain scores or mobility.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> A PCA is not needed after scoliosis surgery with liposomal bupivacaine.</p>

        <p>LOE-Therapeutic-Level I</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> The utilization of robotics coupled with navigation (RCN) in pediatric spine surgery remains a relatively novel approach. This prospective multicenter registry seeks to evaluate the intraoperative efficacy, potential challenges, and complications associated with RCN. It was hypothesized that RCN for pedicle screw placement in pediatric spine surgery has a short-term complication profile equivalent to freehand screw placement.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A comprehensive review of prospectively consented patients, with multiple underlying diagnoses, who underwent posterior spinal fusion surgery using RCN at six pediatric institutions from 2021 to 2023 was conducted. Patient demographics, surgical data, RCN data, technical difficulties, intraoperative, and immediate postoperative complications were summarized.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> The registry consists of 186 patients averaging 15.1&#x2009;years of age. Majority of patients are female (68%) with idiopathic scoliosis (60%). The mean preoperative major curve was 63&#xB0;, and total number of levels instrumented averaged 10.2. RCN levels averaged 6.4 (62%). The robotic platform was mounted via spinous process clamp (80%) and posterior superior iliac spine pin (20%). RCN registration occurred an average of 1.2 times per patient. Thirty-eight patients had registration with preoperative CT (20%), and 146 had O-arm registration (79%). RCN was aborted due to failed registration in two cases (1%). Loss of registration was noted by safety check prior to drilling in 15 cases (8%). Technical difficulties with navigation occurred in 20 cases (11%) requiring recalibration. Inability to perform screw trajectories with RCN due to soft-tissue pressure on the robotic arm occurred in 26 patients (14%). A total of 3272 pedicle screws were placed. Of the 1369 freehand screws, 31 were mispositioned (2.26%), with four medial breaches (0.29%). A total of 1903 screws were executed with RCN (58%). Sixteen RCN screws were mispositioned (0.84%), with three medial breaches (0.16%). Based on granular screw data available for 124 patients, 297 in-out-in screw trajectories were attempted with RCN, of which 291 were executed successfully (98%). All mispositioned screws were redirected intraoperatively; thus, no returns to the operating room for screw malposition were observed. There were no dural tears or neurologic deficits related to screw placement (Table 1).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Prospective multicenter data confirm earlier retrospective studies outlining the safety and efficacy of RCN-assisted pediatric spine surgery.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This is the first prospective multicenter surgical outcomes registry evaluating the use of RCN in pediatric spine surgery. These initial intraoperative results show RCN is a promising technology in the pediatric spine space and warrants further study.</p>

        <p>LOE-Therapeutic-Level IV</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Lumbar microdiscectomy in adolescents is an infrequently performed procedure, reserved for pain and neurologic symptoms unresponsive to nonsurgical management. Most published studies have focused on the interventional impact on pain outcomes creating a paucity of data on physical function and mental health outcomes. The study hypothesis is PROMIS can detect changes in pain, physical function, and mental health in adolescents undergoing lumbar microdiscectomy.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> This is a retrospective analysis including all patients (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;36) who underwent a lumbar microdiscectomy surgery (34 single level, 2 multi-level) from a single surgeon at a tertiary-care pediatric hospital, identified from a surgical database. PROMIS scores (Mobility (MOB), Pain Interference (PI), Upper Extremity (UE), Physical Functioning (PF), Peer Relationships (PR), Anxiety, and Depression) were obtained preoperatively and at 6&#x2009;weeks, 3&#x2009;months, 6&#x2009;months, 1&#x2009;year, and 2+&#x2009;years postoperatively.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 36 patients (24 female), whose mean age was 16.6&#x2009;years at surgery (range, 13&#x2013;20&#x2009;years) were included in the analysis. Preoperatively, 3 patients had motor weakness, 11 lower-extremity numbness, and 35 radicular symptoms. Microdiscectomy levels were L4&#x2009;L5 (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;16), L5&#x2009;S1 (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;18), L4&#x2009;S1 (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;1), and L3&#x2009;L5 (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;1). Mean preoperative PROMIS scores: Mob 32.2 (range, 22.7&#x2013;46.0), PI 62.5 (range, 47.0&#x2013;77.8), UE 44.9 (range, 25.4&#x2013;57.3), PF 37.2 (range, 33.6&#x2013;41.5), PR 55.6 (range, 40.3&#x2013;66.0), anxiety 56.2 (range, 50.6&#x2013;67.1), and depression 48.5 (range, 31.9&#x2013;61.6). Postoperatively, there were improvements in MOB (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.05) at each time point, with a&#x2009;+11.3 improvement at 2&#x2009;years (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0027). In PI, there was a significant decrease (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0001) immediately after surgery with sustained improvement (&#x2212;8.6) at 2&#x2009;years (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0009). For UE and PR, there was a statistically significant improvement from the preoperative baseline scores to the 1-year postoperative visit for UE (+10.6; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.008) and PR (+8.0; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01), but no difference at 2&#x2009;years. PF, anxiety, and depression domains did not demonstrate any statistically significant changes across any time intervals.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Using the PROMIS instrument, there were significant improvements postoperatively after lumbar microdiscectomy in adolescents in MOB, PI, UE, and PR up to 1 year postoperatively and continued improvement in MOB and PI. These data demonstrate PROMIS is a sensitive instrument detecting changes in these four commonly obtained domains over 2-year follow-up after surgery.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Using PROMIS, lumbar microdiscectomies in adolescents, who failed nonsurgical management, demonstrated improvements in pain, upper- and lower-extremity function, and peer relationships postoperatively.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Tibial spine fractures (TSFs) are considered equivalent to midsubstance ruptures of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in terms of injury mechanism. However, why some patients sustain ACL tears and others have TSF has yet to be fully revealed, with only two studies comparing the radiographic knee morphology between patients with ACL tears and TSF. We aimed to identify common morphological risk factors for ACL tears and TSF and determine the morphological difference between ACL tears and TSF.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> One hundred fifty-nine age- and sex-matched patients under 18&#x2009;years of age (53 ACL tears, 53 TSF, and 53 controls with anterior knee pain) who visited a single large pediatric hospital institution between March 2009 and April 2023 were study subjects. Forty-one patients were male, and 12 patients were female in each group. We retrospectively collected demographics and measured various parameters on multiplanar reconstruction MRI, including bone age, articular medial tibial slope (MTS) and lateral tibial slope (LTS), bony MTS and LTS, medial tibial depth (MTD), lateral compartment middle articular cartilage slope (LMCS), lateral compartment meniscus-bone angle (LMBA), lateral compartment meniscus-cartilage height (LMCH), lateral femoral condyle ratio (LFCR), alpha angle, intercondylar notch width index (NWI), and notch angle. The shape of the intercondylar notch was classified into U- or A-shapes. Parameters showing a significant difference among the groups in one-way ANOVA, Kruskal&#x2013;Wallis test, chi-square test, or univariate multinomial logistic regression analysis were selected as independent variables for multivariate analysis.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> The mean age at MRI was 13.5&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;2.2&#x2009;years for males and 12.2&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;2.5&#x2009;years for females. Height, weight, BMI, bone age, articular MTS, bony MTS, MTD, and LMCH were not significantly different among the three groups (Table 1). In the multivariate multinomial logistic regression analysis, articular LTS was associated with the occurrence of ACL tears (relative risk ratio (RRR), 1.27 (95% CI, 1.12&#x2013;1.43)) or TSF (RRR, 1.17 (95% CI, 1.04&#x2013;1.32). The NWI was associated with ACL tears (RRR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.77&#x2013;0.95) but not with TSF (RRR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.91&#x2013;1.11).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> High articular LTS is the common risk factor for both ACL tears and TSF. Patients with ACL tears have a narrow intercondylar notch compared to patients with TSF or controls.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This is the first study that compared knee morphology on MRI among ACL tears, TSF, and controls. The results of this study help bring light to a predisposition toward ACL tears over TSF under a similar injury mechanism in pediatric patients.</p>

        <p>LOE-Diagnostic-Level III</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Several studies have proven that ultrasound (US) can improve the efficiency of early diagnostics of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries. ACL US is mainly performed by sonologists or radiologists. We have very little data on how effective these tests are if they are performed by an orthopedic surgeon. We also have no information on the applicability of ACL US in children and adolescents. In this retrospective study, we analyzed the results of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS), which were performed by orthopedic surgeons on children with suspected ACL injury.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> We reviewed the data of children and adolescents who were examined with ultrasound between 2018 and 2021 for suspected ACL injury. ACL POCUS was done immediately after the physical examination, according to a standard technique. The tests were performed by an orthopedic resident and young and a senior orthopedic surgeon. The inclusion criteria were as follows: The child&#x2019;s age is between 0 and 15&#x2009;years, the growth zones are open, the child later underwent MRI and/or arthroscopy, which confirmed or excluded the fact of an ACL injury. We excluded patients with incomplete recordings and documentation.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> One hundred nineteen children met the aforementioned criteria. The children were between 8 and 15&#x2009;years of age (mean&#x2009;=&#x2009;13.29). Positive findings were found in 47 and negative findings in 72 children with ACL POCUS. During the subsequent treatment, 57 children underwent only MRI examination, 11 children underwent only arthroscopy, and 51 children underwent both MRI and arthroscopy. The specificity of the test was measured as 0.958 and the sensitivity as 0.917 for complete ACL rupture. Regarding all ACL injuries (complete&#x2009;+&#x2009;partial), we found the sensitivity to be 83.019, and the specificity to be 95.45. The interrater agreement between radiologist and clinicians was 94.957% (Cohen&#x2019;s k: 0.8945).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> POCUS can indicate functional insufficiency caused by ACL injury in children and adolescents. The biggest advantage of the test is that it is quick and simple, as well as noninvasive. Further prospective diagnostic tests and standardized examination protocols can confirm our favorable experiences.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Cheap and simple method for the diagnosis of pediatric anterior cruciate ligament injuries.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> The use of quadriceps tendon autograft for ACL reconstruction has been associated with higher rates of complications, including arthrofibrosis, as compared to hamstring and patellar tendon autograft reconstructions. The purpose of this study was to describe complications in adolescent patients requiring reoperation within the first 12&#x2009;months following ACL reconstruction with soft-tissue quadriceps tendon autograft (ACLR-Q).</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A prospective single-center study was performed of all patients younger than 20&#x2009;years who underwent ACL reconstruction with a soft-tissue quadriceps tendon autograft from 26 May 2020 to 28 February 2022. Patients were treated with postoperative bracing in extension until sufficient quadriceps control was obtained. A standard physical therapy protocol was utilized, emphasizing early terminal knee extension and return to sports no sooner than 9&#x2009;months postoperatively pending appropriate strength and mechanics at 6-month functional testing. Postoperative outcomes were collected, including complications requiring reoperation, patient-reported outcome scores, and contralateral ACL injury.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Three-hundred seventy patients, mean age 16&#x2009;years (range 11&#x2013;20&#x2009;years), underwent ACLR-Q during the study window. Three-hundred nine patients (84%) had minimum 1-year follow-up and were included in this study. Mean femoral graft size was 9.1&#x2009;mm, tibial graft size 8.9&#x2009;mm, and median graft length 65&#x2009;mm. Among the 309 included patients, there were 26 complications (8%) requiring reoperation within the first 12&#x2009;months following ACLR-Q. The most common complication was arthrofibrosis treated with arthroscopic lysis of adhesions and manipulation under anesthesia (13 patients, 4%). ACL graft tear occurred in eight patients (3%). Reoperation for meniscal pathology occurred in two patients (1%). Two patients sustained a contralateral ACL tear. There were no patella fractures or quadriceps tendon ruptures. Among the 61 excluded patients, there was one complication, which was a deep infection treated with irrigation and debridement and graft salvage.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> ACLR-Q in adolescent patients using postoperative bracing in extension and a physical therapy protocol emphasizing early terminal knee extension is associated with low rates of arthrofibrosis and no donor site complications. ACL graft rupture in the first year was low.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Quadriceps tendon autograft ACL reconstruction can be reliably performed in adolescents with very low rates of arthrofibrosis by utilizing postoperative bracing in hyperextension and a physical therapy protocol emphasizing early terminal knee extension.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Given the high rate of graft failure in young patients undergoing anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR), there is increasing interest in concomitant lateral extra-articular procedures (LEAP). However, the risk of complications following addition of a LEAP in the pediatric population remains unclear. We hypothesized that children and adolescents undergoing combined ACLR with a novel LEAP will not have more early complications than those undergoing ACLR alone.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> The records of patients that underwent primary ACLR at a single tertiary children&#x2019;s hospital were reviewed for this retrospective cohort study. Those with multiligament reconstructions, a modified MacIntosh reconstruction, or&#x2009;&lt;1&#x2009;year of follow-up were excluded. The LEAP procedure utilized a strip of iliotibial (IT) band autograft that remains attached at Gerdy&#x2019;s tubercle and is then fixed to both the femur and tibia, resulting in one limb that is similar to the Lemaire tenodesis and another that reconstructs the anterolateral ligament. Demographic data, intraoperative findings and techniques, and postoperative complications were compared between patients that underwent ACLR with a LEAP versus ACLR alone.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 268 patients were included in the analysis, of which 49 (18%) underwent LEAP with ACLR. The most common short-term complication was persistent pain&#x2009;&gt;3&#x2009;months in 4.1% of patients with LEAP and 5.9% of those with ACLR alone (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.0). Similarly, there was no difference in the proportion of patients with arthrofibrosis (10.2% of patients with LEAP, 9.6% with ACLR alone; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.90), superficial wound infection (2.0% of patients with LEAP, 3.7% with ACLR alone; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.0), or reoperation for any reason (32.6% of patients with LEAP, 36.5% with ACLR alone; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.78). No other significant differences in short-term complications were noted. ACL graft failure was sustained by 3/49 patients (6.1%) with a LEAP and 31/219 (14.2%) with ACLR alone, although the study was underpowered to detect a significant difference (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.13).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> A novel LEAP procedure utilizing IT band autograft does not increase the risk of early complications in children and adolescents undergoing ACLR, including prolonged pain or infection. Further research is required to determine the long-term risks and benefits of this procedure.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> The literature on concomitant LEAP with ACLR in children is growing but still limited. Specifically, the complication risk of adding a LEAP is not well defined. The present study provides novel data on short-term risks of this increasingly common procedure.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Stiffness following a pediatric ACL reconstruction is a common complication. The purpose of this study was to identify the incidence of and evaluate factors associated with stiffness following pediatric anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction using a large multicenter data registry.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A multicenter, surgeon-driven quality-improvement registry (28 institutions, 36 surgeons) was queried to evaluate complications, demographics, and surgical details from patients&#x2009;&lt;19&#x2009;years old who underwent ACL reconstruction at least 8&#x2009;months prior to analysis. Stiffness was defined by loss of motion that resulted in deviation from the normal postoperative clinical course (&#x2265;Clavien-Dindo (CD) II). Deviations include additional physical therapy, serial or dynamic splinting, or subsequent surgical intervention related to postoperative flexion loss, extension loss, or combined flexion/extension loss. Bivariable statistics were used to evaluate associations between hospital-level factors, surgeon-level factors, patient-level factors, and intraoperative factors. Hierarchal multivariable logistic regression models were utilized to identify patient and intraoperative factors associated with postoperative stiffness while accounting for the clustering of patients within hospitals or surgical centers.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Of 5811 patients identified who underwent ACL reconstruction surgery from 2018 to 2023, 4504 patients (mean age 15.1, range 5&#x2013;19&#x2009;years and 47.0% female) met inclusion criteria. Of those, 193 (4.3%) were found to have loss of motion (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;93 CD-II and n&#x2009;=&#x2009;100 CD-III) (Table 1). Bivariable analysis noted no differences in stiffness incidence by age, graft type, tunnel diameters, surgical technique, or concomitant procedures. Accounting for hierarchal structure and fixation and graft type, female sex was associated with stiffness incidence, with 3.2 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.3&#x2013;4.5) times greater odds of stiffness than males. There were also notable variations in postoperative stiffness when comparing fixation strategies. Femoral fixation with an adjustable loop and fixed loop had higher odds of postoperative stiffness relative to fixation with an interference screw (odds ratio (OR) (95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.7&#x2013;6.3) and OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;4.5 (95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.0&#x2013;10.0), respectively), despite no difference in graft type.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Based on a multilevel multivariable analysis of a large, multicenter patient registry, the development of postoperative knee stiffness following pediatric ACL reconstruction surgery was found to be associated with female sex and suspensory fixation on the femur.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Given that postoperative knee stiffness can significantly impact quality of life and may require secondary surgery, it is important for surgeons to identify the modifiable and nonmodifiable risk factors associated with stiffness. Our study suggests that female sex and suspensory fixation on the femur are associated with knee stiffness following pediatric ACL reconstruction.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Limited literature exists regarding septic arthritis following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) in pediatric and adolescent patients. This study therefore evaluates 20&#x2009;years of ACLRs performed by eight surgeons on pediatric and adolescent patients with a young adult control cohort.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> All ACLRs at the institution from 2000 to 2020 were retrospectively searched for septic arthritis cases. Included patients (1) underwent primary or revision ACLR and (2) subsequently were diagnosed with ipsilateral knee septic arthritis with synovial fluid cell counts&#x2009;&gt;50,000 or positive bacterial cultures. Surgical data, bacterial results, and clinical outcomes were collected. Age-based cohorts included &#x201C;pediatric&#x201D; (&lt;13), &#x201C;adolescent&#x201D; (13&#x2013;19), and &#x201C;young adult&#x201D; (20&#x2013;35). Chi-square tests were performed between age, graft source, graft type, concurrent meniscal surgery, and septic arthritis incidence. <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-Tests were performed on durations between septic and nonseptic cases.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 5638 ACLRs (4123 adolescent; 909 young adult; 606 pediatric) were performed. Thirteen (0.23%) septic arthritis cases were identified at median 12&#x2009;days (range 8630) after ACLR, with varying graft-based incidences. Three patients who were diagnosed at mean 12&#x2009;months after ACLR had undergone ipsilateral knee arthroscopy within 18&#x2009;days preceding diagnosis. Among the remaining 10, diagnosis occurred at mean 13.3&#x2009;days (range 6&#x2013;36). All patients underwent arthroscopic I&amp;D (mean 2.1 occurrences, range 1&#x2013;4), and retained grafts. Mean follow-up was 3.5&#x2009;years (7&#x2009;months&#x2013;9.2 years). One patient underwent revision ACLR 6&#x2009;years after the index ACLR. Two patients underwent subsequent lysis of adhesions, and four underwent seven meniscectomies or patellofemoral procedures. All grew positive bacterial cultures, most commonly <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;3, 23.1%), and other <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus</italic> species (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;9, 69.2%). Nine (69.2%) patients discharged on intravenous antibiotics, while 4 (30.8%) received oral. No significant associations were identified by graft source, graft type, age, or concurrent meniscal surgery. There were no pediatric cases. Adolescents (0.30%) and young adults (0.18%) experienced similar incidences (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.27). Mean case and tourniquet durations did not significantly differ (septic: 151.7, 87.4&#x2009;minutes vs nonseptic: 134.7, 74).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Post-ACLR septic arthritis was similarly uncommon between adolescents and young adults. No cases were identified in 606 pediatric patients. Graft source, graft type, or concurrent meniscal surgery was not associated with infection. <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus</italic> species caused most cases. Aggressive treatment, most commonly with multiple I&amp;Ds and extended antibiotics, was associated with graft retention in all cases, with no suggestion of disproportionate subsequent risk of graft rupture.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> The present study examines the incidence of risk factors for and treatment course following post-ACLR septic arthritis in a large pediatric and adolescent population.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> It is recognized that pediatric patients who undergo anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) have higher rates of graft failure and secondary knee injury than the adult population. Hence, there is an increasing utilization of functional limb testing (FLT) criteria to optimize patient recovery prior to returning to sport. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of age on FLT results at 9&#x2009;months after ACLR. Our hypothesis was that a pediatric population would have greater deficits in FLT measurements of the operative leg than an equivalent adult population.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> From 2017 to 2022, our institution recorded 1377 patients who underwent an ACLR and completed FLT during the rehabilitation period. The present study included only patients who had isolated hamstring autograft ACLR and who underwent FLT at the 9-month postoperative time point. The remaining patients were divided into pediatric group (aged&#x2009;&#x2264;16&#x2009;years) and an adult group (&gt;16&#x2009;years) based on age at time of surgery (134 &#x201C;pediatric&#x201D; and 439 &#x201C;adult&#x201D;). We then selected a sub-cohort from each group who were matched approximately for gender percentage, body mass index, meniscal pathology percentage, preoperative Tegner score, and the percentage of double tendon constructs to provide two highly matched groups. Final analysis included 120 &#x201C;pediatric&#x201D; and 221 &#x201C;adult&#x201D; patients.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> FLT data recorded at 9&#x2009;months after the surgery were compared between the groups with measures of central tendency, standard deviation, and p-value. Measurements included quadriceps strength limb symmetry index (LSI), hamstring strength LSI, hamstring:quads ratio, Y-balance test LSI, and hop testing LSI. There was a statistically significant difference between the cohorts for hop height (92% pediatrics to 83%, adult p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001), quadriceps strength LSI (94%&#x2013;87%, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001), and the hamstring:quadriceps ratio of ACLR limb (41.5&#x2013;48.0, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001). There was a weak statistical significance for hop distance LSI (104%&#x2013;91%, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.1) while hamstring strength LSI, Y-balance testing, and ACL return to sport psychological testing comparisons had no significant difference.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In pediatric patients who underwent FLT 9&#x2009;months after hamstring ACLR, there was a prevalence of stronger quadriceps and weaker hamstring strength than the adult cohort. This may be due to slower physiological recovery, poorer rehabilitation compliance, or from higher focus on quadriceps rehabilitation.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This finding supports our hypothesis that children have greater deficits in some aspects of FLT after ACLR and may be a factor which contributes to higher rates of reinjury in pediatric patients.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Discoid lateral meniscus (DLM) is the most common congenital malformation of the meniscus. DLM is known to have a higher prevalence among patients with achondroplasia. We report the clinical, anatomical, and operative findings of discoid lateral menisci between pediatric patients with and without achondroplasia.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> This multicenter retrospective review includes patients diagnosed with DLM confirmed at surgery from nine centers across North America over the past 20&#x2009;years. Demographics and clinical characteristics including symptoms, discoid morphology, treatment, survival, and concomitant medical diagnoses were recorded. Means with ranges and counts with proportions were reported for continuous and categorical data, respectively. A Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to compare age at diagnosis between those with and without achondroplasia.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Eight hundred sixty-eight patients met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 12 patients (1.4%) had a diagnosis of achondroplasia. Average age at diagnosis of DLM among achondroplasia patients (mean 17&#x2009;years, range 12&#x2013;19) was significantly older than the overall population (mean 12&#x2009;years, range 1&#x2013;22, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01). The most common presenting symptoms among DLM patients with and without achondroplasia were snapping and/or clunking. Eight (67%) patients with achondroplasia and 75% in the overall population had a meniscus tear. Compared to the overall population, a higher proportion of achondroplasia patients showed complex tears (75% vs 42%) and a lower proportion showed horizontal tears (25% vs 38%). Instability of the meniscus was less common among achondroplasia patients, seen in 3 (25%) compared to the overall population (38%); two patients had posterior instability, while one was unreported. Meniscus repair rates were similar between the populations (63% vs 56%). Among the five patients with achondroplasia who underwent repair, three had all-inside and two had inside-out repair. One patient underwent retreatment following their initial surgery, a repeat arthroscopy, and partial meniscectomy.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The diagnosis of DLM was made at an older age in patients with achondroplasia; however, surgical treatments and outcomes for DLM patients with and without achondroplasia were comparable.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This study presents one of the largest case series of discoid lateral menisci in a pediatric population, including patients from multiple centers across North America. It compares patients with DLM with and without achondroplasia, identifying useful similarities and differences, and suggesting that delays in diagnosis of DLM in patients with achondroplasia may be common.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> This pioneering study aimed to evaluate the effectivity, feasibility, and safety of MRI-guided percutaneous retrograde joint-sparing drilling in the treatment of osteochondritis dissecans of the talus (OCDT) in children.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> The single-center study comprised 30 stable, symptomatic osteochondritis dissecans of the talus (OCDT) lesions in 27 consecutive patients (mean age 13&#x2009;years) unresponsive to nonoperative treatment in 2010&#x2013;2019. MRI-guided retrograde drilling of the lesion was performed for all. Figure 1 demonstrates the study technique (A-B, perioperative MRI) in a case with OCDT (C-D, preoperative MRI). All lesions were evaluated and classified preoperatively and postoperatively using a validated MRI-based 5-grade scale. All lesions presented grade II&#x2013;III preoperatively. Improvement of the OCDT (increased ossification and/or lower grade) in MRI was the main outcome. Furthermore, postprocedural questionnaire about pain (Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) 0&#x2013;10) and physical performance (0&#x2013;10), as well as procedure-associated symptoms were analyzed. The follow-up time was a mean 6&#x2009;years; 4.8&#x2009;months (range 1&#x2013;12) in imaging and 73&#x2009;months (29&#x2013;137) in subjective symptoms.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> All lesions remained stable during the follow-up. Increased ossification was seen in 39% of the lesions by the 5-month mark. There was improvement in the OCDT grade in eight patients during the follow-up (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.039): three grade III lesions improved to grade I, and five grade III lesions improved to II. One out of 30 cases progressed from grade II to III despite the treatment, while all other remained unchanged during the follow-up. Most (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;17, 63.3%) patients reported less or lacking pain at the end of the follow-up. The mean decrease of VAS (pain) was &#x2212;3.8 (SD 2.6, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), and increase of physical performance, 2.6 (SD 3.1, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001). The procedure was technically successful in all lesions, and no major complications were found. All patients were discharged on the index day. Orally administered anti-inflammatory medication and paracetamol provided satisfactory postprocedural pain relief in 96.7% of the patients.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> MRI-guided retrograde drilling of stable OCDT is a novel method that seems to be feasible, safe, and moderately effective in treating children&#x2019;s OCDT. A prospective comparative clinical trial with longer radiographic follow-up is warranted.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> MRI-guided retrograde drilling of OCDT provides minimally invasive option for patients unresponsive to conservative treatment, without damaging the joint cartilage. It is a less-invasive treatment than surgery and suitable for outpatient care. Lack of ionizing radiation makes it a justified method for children in particular.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Multimodal pain programs for orthopedic surgery may minimize pain and narcotic use by utilizing education and intravenous, oral, skin infiltrative, and peri-neural medications. These programs have proven useful in previous studies; however, further research into the relative benefits of peripheral nerve block (PNB) inclusion within these programs is needed. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a multimodal pain program for lower-extremity orthopedic procedures and determine if a single-shot PNB altered these outcomes.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> An institutional review board (IRB)-approved review of prospectively collected patient-reported pain data from two surgeons utilizing a standardized pain management protocol for outpatient surgery at a single tertiary sports medicine institution was completed. The protocol was divided into two treatment groups based on surgical date: with and without a PNB. Preoperative pain education was provided to all patients, and preoperative and perioperative medications were weight-based and standardized. Postoperatively, patients aged&#x2009;&lt;12&#x2009;years alternated between acetaminophen and ibuprofen with rescue hydrocodone (max 12 doses). Patients aged&#x2009;&#x2265;12&#x2009;years alternated between acetaminophen and ketorolac (days 1&#x2013;3) or ibuprofen (days 4&#x2013;7) with rescue tramadol (max 12 doses). All patients were monitored using the Wong-Baker Pain Scale, institution-specific pain management questionnaires, and narcotic use. Treatment groups were randomly balanced by procedure type to ensure equal sample size. Chi-square and Mann&#x2013;Whitney tests using IBM SPSS Statistics 24 were run as appropriate with &#x3B1;&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.05.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 306 patients (14.7&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;2.5&#x2009;years, 51.3% female) were analyzed. The pain satisfaction score across the cohort was 8.6&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;2.1 (0&#x2009;=&#x2009;not satisfied, 10&#x2009;=&#x2009;extremely satisfied). Wong-Baker Visual Analog Pain Scores (VAS) were worse in the PNB group than in the no PNB group at postoperative day 1 (3.7 vs 2.8; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.021), day 4 (2.9 vs 1.9; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002), and day 7 (2.7 vs 1.9; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.014). Generally, no difference in rescue narcotic use was observed between groups, with 6.4&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;3.8 total pills (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.192) taken by day 7. There was no difference in the low number of patients (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;8, 5.3%; 4 PNB, 4 no PNB) who called their physician office regarding concerns for increased pain.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> A standardized multimodal pain program resulted in relatively high satisfaction and low narcotic use across a broad cohort of pediatric and adolescent knee sports surgeries. PNB resulted in no benefit and worse VAS pain scores.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Multimodal pain programs should be considered for outpatient pediatric sports procedures, but the inclusion of a PNB may not provide any benefits for pain reduction.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> The Society of Pediatric Anesthesia Improvement Network (SPAIN) was developed as a multi-institutional collaborative with the goal of prospectively and systematically documenting the perioperative care and outcomes in children undergoing surgical procedures where anesthetic or pain management approaches are variable. Wide variability exists in the perioperative pain management surrounding Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) reconstruction surgery.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Patients less than 19&#x2009;years of age who underwent ACL reconstruction at 15 different institutions from December 2020 through December 2022 were prospectively enrolled. Continuous data are reported as median and interquartile range and categorical data are summarized as frequencies and percentages. Statistical analyses and group comparisons were performed using the nonparametric Wilcoxon rank sum test, the Chi-square test, and Fisher&#x2019;s exact test.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 519 patients with an average age of 15&#x2009;years (9&#x2013;18) were analyzed. Seventy-two (13.9%) had no perioperative nerve block (NB), 222 (42.8%) had a single nerve block (SB), and 225 (43.4%) had multiple nerve blocks (MB). Blocks performed included: Adductor canal (60.2 %), femoral (24.7%), popliteal (26%), and lateral femoral cutaneous (12.3%). Twenty percent had an indwelling catheter. There was no statistical significance in the duration of PACU length of stay between the 3 groups. Pain scores on postoperative day (POD) 1 were higher in the NB patients (38.5%) vs those with SB (26.6%) and MB (21%) (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.04). Pain scores were also higher in patients without an indwelling catheter vs those with a catheter (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). There was no significant difference in pain scores between groups on POD 3. Persistent numbness was found at 6&#x2009;months in none of the NB patients, vs 12.8% and 15.2% in patients with SB and MB, respectively. Table 1 shows univariate regression analysis of PACU pain scores.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> There is variability in the perioperative pain management of ACL reconstruction surgery. In the early postoperative period (POD1) placing a nerve block with an indwelling catheter appears to provide better pain control than no block or catheter. However, persistent numbness may persist 6&#x2009;months postoperatively in 12%&#x2013;15% of patients who receive a nerve block.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> These results can aid physicians to better counsel patients on the risks and benefits of perioperative pain control including regional anesthetics. The initial data presented here will inform future studies and aid to establish best practices for perioperative pain control in ACL reconstruction.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Peripheral nerve blocks (PNB) are commonly utilized in pediatric orthopedic surgery to assist with pain management, and adjuvants may be utilized with local anesthetics to extend block duration. Precedex (dexmedetomidine, &#x3B1;-2 agonist) is a common adjuvant with low risks reported in the anesthetic literature, but with little data on pediatric orthopedic use. This study aimed to evaluate reported peripheral nerve complications following arthroscopic knee surgery in groups treated with and without Precedex-augmented PNB.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Single-center data from a prospective multicenter quality improvement registry for knee procedures (SCORE) was retrospectively reviewed for reported nerve complications. Over a consecutive timeline, two surgeons&#x2019; patients were treated with the following PNB protocol over three time periods: single-shot adductor PNB with 0.2% or 0.35% plain ropivacaine and 10 mcg or 20 mcg Precedex (&lt;60&#x2009;kg vs&#x2009;&#x2265;60&#x2009;kg), no adductor PNB, or adductor PNB with 0.2% or 0.35% plain isolated ropivacaine. Complications were defined as motor or sensory loss documented at a follow-up visit. Saphenous nerves were found to be uniformly affected, and as such, each procedure was categorized as within or outside the medial knee saphenous zone (at-risk or not at-risk). Chi-Square and Mann&#x2013;Whitney tests were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 24 to compare the relationship between nerve complications, duration, and cohort, age, sex, procedure area, and at-risk procedure.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 300 knee procedure cases (14.2&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;2.7&#x2009;years, range 5&#x2013;19; 50.0% female) were identified, consisting of 33.3% isolated anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction or tibial spine, 31.3% medial meniscus, and 35.3% lateral meniscus. No difference in procedure area type distribution between groups was observed. Nine patients (7.5%) in the Precedex-augmented PNB group reported sensory loss lasting 120.44&#x2009;days (8&#x2013;324; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.014), while one (0.7%) patient in the NO PNB group (all-inside medial meniscal repair) reported 38&#x2009;days of sensory loss, and one (2.3%) patient in the isolated ropivacaine PNB group demonstrated 43&#x2009;days of sensory loss. There was no significance when comparing at-risk procedures and nerve complications (3.9% in &#x201C;not at-risk&#x201D; vs 3.2% for &#x201C;at-risk,&#x201D; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.767).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The use of Precedex as a PNB adjuvant may be linked to an increased incidence (7.5%) of neurotoxic complications after pediatric and adolescent arthroscopic knee procedures that prolong symptoms.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Surgeons and anesthesiologists should be aware of the risk of saphenous nerve complications following adductor single-shot PNB, with particular concern regarding adjunctive Precedex, when considering perioperative multi-modal pain strategies.</p>

        <p>LOE-Economic-Level III</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> The Subaxial Cervical Spine Injury Classification System (SLIC) was developed to guide clinical decision-making regarding subaxial cervical spine trauma in adults, with a score&#x2009;&#x2264;3 indicating non-operative management, a score&#x2009;&#x2265;5 indicating operative management, and a score of 4 being equivocal with treatment at the physician&#x2019;s discretion. Although a substantial portion of pediatric spine fractures occur in the cervical spine, there is no validated injury classification system for children. The aim of this study was to assess the validity of the SLIC in the pediatric population.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective single-center spine trauma database was queried for pediatric patients with traumatic subaxial cervical spine injury treated at a single level-1 pediatric trauma center between 2007 and 2020. Exclusion criteria included chronic cervical spine conditions and injuries, acute care at an outside institution, incomplete records or lack of imaging, or death prior to definitive treatment. Patients were grouped based on established cutoffs used to guide treatment in adults: SLIC&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;3, SLIC&#x2009;=&#x2009;4, and SLIC&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;5.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Retrospective review identified 50 pediatric patients who survived traumatic subaxial cervical spine injury (operative&#x2009;=&#x2009;8, nonoperative&#x2009;=&#x2009;42). Demographics were similar with no difference in age, sex, mechanism of injury, or pediatric trauma score between groups (Table 1). Most injuries in the operative cohort occurred at C4 (37.5%) or C5 (37.5%) compared to C7 (52.4%) in the nonoperative cohort. Of the 12 patients with SLIC&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;5, 8 (75%) were treated operatively while 4 (25%) were treated nonoperatively. All 34 patients with SLIC&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;3 and all 4 patients with SLIC&#x2009;=&#x2009;4 were treated nonoperatively. Of the 4 patients with SLIC&#x2009;=&#x2009;4, 3 had mild neck pain, and 1 was asymptomatic at last follow-up. Of the 4 patients with SLIC&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;5 treated nonoperatively, 2 were asymptomatic at last follow-up, 1 had residual upper-extremity weakness, and 1 remained paraplegic from spinal cord injury. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 100%, 89.5%, 66.7%, and 100%, respectively. The area under the curve (AUC) and F1 score were 0.97 (0.92&#x2013;1.00) and 0.80, respectively.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> SLIC demonstrated strong validity in retrospectively predicting treatment in a pediatric population, particularly in patients with SLIC&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;3. At average 17&#x2009;months of follow-up, no patients with SLIC&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;4 treated nonoperatively demonstrated evidence of mechanical instability or progressive neurological decline.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> SLIC demonstrates strong validity for guiding treatment decisions in pediatric subaxial cervical spine injuries.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Pediatric pelvic ring injuries represent a rare but potentially devastating injury, ranging from low energy to life-threatening, multi-system trauma. Given its low incidence, principles from adult trauma are frequently applied to the pediatric patient to guide evaluation and management, though precise indications remain poorly understood. By utilizing a national database, we aim to elucidate the similarities and differences in epidemiology, management, and outcomes of pediatric and adult pelvic ring injuries to improve pediatric trauma management.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis using patient data via the TriNetX data network of pediatric patients admitted from the emergency room with a diagnosis of pelvic ring injury between 2003 and 2023. Our study included 1906 pediatric patients (ages&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;17) and 14,699 adults (ages 18&#x2013;65&#x2009;years) with pelvic ring injuries. Cohorts were matched for gender and concomitant injuries and further categorized based on surgical treatment: 84 pediatric patients who underwent surgery compared to 1034 propensity score matched adult counterparts. Outcomes of interest included mortality, blood transfusion, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, surgical management of pelvic ring injury, use of external fixation, and surgical site infection (SSI). Hazard ratios were calculated for the outcomes of interest, and alpha was set at 0.05.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Pediatric patients with pelvic ring injuries had significantly lower mortality, rate of transfusion, and ICU admission in both unmatched and matched cohorts. However, among pediatric patients who were surgically treated, these same outcomes (mortality, transfusion, and ICU admission) were no longer significantly different compared to adult patients (Table 1). In general, pediatric patients were less likely to undergo surgical management of pelvic ring injuries (HR 0.569, 95% CI 0.496&#x2013;0.641, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001). External fixation was utilized at a similar rate among adults and children who were surgically managed (HR 0.657, 95% CI 0.623&#x2013;1.288, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.657).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In general, pediatric patients with pelvic ring injuries have more favorable outcomes and lower rates of surgical fixation than adult patients. However, providers should identify and acknowledge an important subset of pediatric patients who undergo surgical intervention, as these patients have similar rates of mortality, blood transfusions, and ICU admission compared to their adult counterparts.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Management and outcomes of pediatric pelvic ring injuries are unique compared to the adult population. Extreme vigilance is required for the subset of patients requiring surgical management.</p>

        <p>LOE-Prognostic-Level III</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Acute compartment syndrome (ACS) is an emergent clinical diagnosis described as most caused by traumatic fractures (75%) with an overall 15% mortality rate. This project analyzed the etiologies of acute compartment syndrome diagnosed at a level I pediatric trauma center. The primary outcome was the prevalence of nonfracture etiologies, and the secondary outcome was mortality rates by etiology.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Medical records of a level I pediatric trauma center were retrospectively queried from 1 January 2010-09 January 2023 using ICD codes for compartment syndrome. Inclusion criteria included age&#x2009;&lt;19&#x2009;years and acute diagnosis of extremity CS. Each extremity was classified into one of the following etiologies: Vascular, Fracture, Non-Fracture Related Trauma, Iatrogenic, and Other.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 129 patients with a total of 146 extremities with ACS were analyzed. Ninety-one percent received fasciotomies, and&#x2009;&gt;83% underwent intraoperative compartment checks. Twenty-nine percent of ACS was diagnosed in the upper extremity (UE) versus 71% in the lower extremity (LE) (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.68). Overall, 39.7% of extremity ACS were found to be secondary to vascular etiologies, 33.6% fractures, 13.7% nonfracture trauma, 11.6% iatrogenic, and 1.4% other. There was no statistically significant difference among causes for selective UE or LE ACS (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.27 and p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.68, respectively). The most common vascular causes were cardiac arrest or shock (32%), cardiothoracic or interventional surgery (23%), and septic shock (20%). The most common fracture causes were tibia fractures (45%), supracondylar or peri-elbow fractures (20%), and both bone forearm fractures (14%). Nonfracture trauma causes included sports injuries, motor vehicle accidents, or other nonsport crush injuries, gunshot wounds, and snake bites. Iatrogenic causes included infiltrated intraosseus, peripheral, or arterial lines, and surgical positioning or technique. Overall mortality rate was 15%. ICU patients and vascular causes had a 35% and 34% mortality rate, respectively. Inpatients diagnosed with compartment syndrome on non-ICU floors, fracture etiology, and nonfracture trauma etiology all showed mortality rates of 0%.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Vascular etiologies were the most common cause of pediatric ACS at a level 1 pediatric trauma center has a mortality rate of 34%, 19% higher than overall. Vascular causes (40%) and fractures (34%) consisted of 74% of the causes of acute pediatric compartment syndrome of the upper and lower extremities. However, non-fracture-related trauma and iatrogenic causes are also considerable etiologies. Fractures and non-ICU inpatient consults showed no risk of mortality.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Further research is required to analyze risk factors and outcomes across pediatric ACS vascular and nonfracture etiologies to better prevent, diagnose, and treat pediatric ACS.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> The clinical implications of surgical fixation on shoulder function, including sensory changes and activities of daily living (ADLs), remain incompletely studied in adolescents following treatment of completely displaced clavicle fractures, including sex-specific comparisons.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> identified from a larger prospective study and sent a novel questionnaire investigating ADLs and sensation-related changes of the operative chest and shoulder. Demographics, fracture characteristics, outcomes, complications, and PROs were analyzed for patients with&#x2009;&gt;1-year follow-up, with nonoperatively treated females and operatively treated males who completed the same sensory questionnaire serving as two different control groups.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> From the overall cohort of 788, 165 female patients (20.9%) were identified, including 35 ORIF (21.2%) and 130 NonOp (78.8%). The ORIF cohort was older (15.5&#x2009;years ORIF vs 13.5&#x2009;years NonOp; p&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;0.001) and had more superior displacement (16.5&#x2009;mm ORIF; 13.9&#x2009;mm NonOp, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.013) and higher Marx activity scores (14.5 ORIF, 12.5 NonOp; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01). However, there were no significant differences in shortening, comminution, angulation, or other fracture characteristics between the cohorts, no difference in return to sport (RTS) (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.334), appearance (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.417), general satisfaction (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.368), ASES (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.134), QuickDASH (0.083), EQ5D (0.083), or EQVAS (0.064) scores. Complications were more common in the ORIF cohort (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.005). Twenty-three of 35 female ORIF patients completed the sensory questionnaire (66%) at a mean of 6&#x2009;years after surgery. Thirty-five percent reported implants as &#x201C;bothersome,&#x201D; and 26% &#x201C;painful,&#x201D; citing pain with various ADLs (wearing bras (22%), backpacks (22%), carrying a bag/purse (17%), driving/wearing a seatbelt (17%), and carrying heavy objects (17%)). Fifty-two percent of female ORIF patients reported changes in sensation over the chest and/or shoulder of the operative side, and 52% were &#x201C;less than completely satisfied&#x201D; with appearance. Six percent had undergone implant removal, and 9% expressed interest in implant removal. The 35 male ORIF patients who completed sensory questionnaires reported fewer sensory changes (46%), less pain with seatbelts (6%), and lower rates of being &#x201C;less than completely satisfied with appearance&#x201D; (29%). Females were significantly more likely than males to have pain carrying a backpack or a bag (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.03 and 0.02, respectively).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Female ORIF patients had more complications but no differences in overall PROs, RTS, appearance, or general satisfaction than female NonOp patients. Rates of sensory and pain symptoms were greater in female ORIF patients than male counterparts.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Female patients and parents should be advised of these findings when making decisions regarding treatment options for displaced clavicle fractures.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> The pediatric volar Barton fracture is recognized as a distal radius Salter-Harris II variant with its large volar Thurstan Holland fragment. A subset of these fractures has additional dorsal comminution, the so-called dorsal spike fragment. The purpose of this study was to compare the rate of delayed extensor tendon injury in pediatric volar Barton factures with and without an unreduced dorsal spike fragment.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A radiographic review of distal radius fracture patients treated between 2010 and 2021 identified 68 displaced pediatric volar Barton fracture patients. Following closed reduction, 5 patients (3&#x2009;females, 2 males) had unreduced dorsal spike fragments and 53 (31 males, 22&#x2009;females) did not. All included patients had closed injuries, open growth plates, and a minimum of 1-year follow-up. The Fisher exact test was used to compare rates of extensor tendon injury between these two groups.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> The average age of the children in the unreduced dorsal spike group was 12 years and 2&#x2009;months (range 11 years and 7&#x2009;months to 14 years and 5&#x2009;months) and 11 years and 9&#x2009;months (range 7 years and 4&#x2009;months to 16 years and 7&#x2009;months) in the nondorsal spike group. A statistically significant (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0003) difference in rate of tendon injury was identified: 3/5 (3&#x2009;F) patients in the dorsal spike group and 0/53 patients in the nondorsal spike group. Injured extensor tendons were ECRB, EIP, and EPL. All tendon injuries manifested 9&#x2013;12&#x2009;months after the injury. This translated into an estimated 32 times higher risk [95% CI 4, 252] of extensor tendon injury when the unreduced dorsal spike fragment was present.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The presence of the dorsal spike fragment conveys substantial risk for delayed extensor tendon injury.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> The subset of pediatric volar Barton fractures with an unreduced dorsal spike fragment deserves additional attention aimed at addressing this comminution to protect extensor tendons.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Premature physeal arrest is a relatively uncommon complication of distal radial physeal fractures with estimated rates between 1%&#x2013;10%. There are limited data on the risk of physeal closure following injury to the distal ulna. The aim of this study is to quantify the rate posttraumatic distal ulnar physeal closure and identify salient risk factors.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Patients with a distal ulnar physeal fracture and minimum 6-month follow-up at a single children&#x2019;s hospital had demographic, injury characteristics, Salter-Harris (SH) classification, treatment, and outcomes data abstracted from the medical record. Follow-up radiographs were reviewed for changes in ulnar variance or signs of premature physeal arrest. Descriptive statistics and Fisher&#x2019;s Exact Tests were performed.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Fifty-six children (35 males) with an average age of 10.7&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;3.3&#x2009;years were included with mean follow-up of 1.9&#x2009;years. The most common fracture pattern was a SH II (52.7%), with 29.1% SH I, 9.1% SH III, and 9.1% SH IV. Over two-thirds of patients (69.6%, 39/56) had a concomitant distal radius fracture, 12.5% (7/56) an additional extraphyseal ulnar styloid fracture, and 8.9% (5/56) additional injuries to the ipsilateral upper extremity. Of all, 41.1% (23/56) of the distal ulnar physeal fractures were displaced (mean translation 40&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;38% and angulation 25&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;21&#xB0;). In total, 32.1% (18/56) underwent closed reduction and 12.5% (7/56) underwent open reduction and internal fixation. 19.6% (11/56) demonstrated radiographic signs of growth disturbance, including 3 patients (5.4%) with growth disturbance but continued longitudinal growth and 8 patients (14.3%) with complete growth arrest (Figure 1A). Average maximal ulnar variance was &#x2212;3.4&#x2009;mm. Three patients (27.3%) underwent subsequent surgical reconstruction including ulnar lengthening with external fixator (Figure 1B), distal ulna completion epiphysiodesis with distal radius epiphysiodesis, and ulnar corrective osteotomy. Patients with displaced distal ulnar fractures and Salter Harris III or IV fractures were more likely to develop a growth disturbance (34.8% vs 3.2%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.003; 50.0% vs 11.1%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.012, respectively). Children with&#x2009;&lt;2&#x2009;years of skeletal growth remaining had a higher risk of growth disturbance (46.2% vs 9.5%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.007). Other complications included symptomatic ulnar styloid nonunion (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;2), TFCC injury (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;2), and distal radio ulnar joint (DRUJ) subluxation (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;1).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Intra-articular physeal fractures (SH III and IV) of the distal ulna carry an approximate 20% risk of growth arrest, notably lower than previously reported.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Displaced and intra-articular distal ulnar physeal fractures and older children are at increased risk of growth arrest highlighting the need for careful monitoring.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Pediatric femoral shaft fractures are a common injury treated by orthopedic surgeons of many subspecialties. This study examines trends in management techniques by patient age over the last 20&#x2009;years with a focus on flexible versus rigid intramedullary nail fixation. While rigid nail fixation carries risk of femoral head avascular necrosis, rigid fixation can offer benefits such as earlier weightbearing and lower risk of malunion. In addition, the 2009 AAOS Clinical Practice Guidelines made a strong recommendation against flexible intramedullary nail fixation in patients older than 11&#x2009;years. We hypothesize that these factors may lead to an increase in utilization of rigid nail fixation for pediatric femoral shaft fractures.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> The American Board of Orthopedic Surgery database of Candidates for the Part II examination from 2002 to 2021 was queried using CPT codes 27506 and 27507 to identify patients who underwent operative fixation of femur fractures. Case descriptions were reviewed to subdivide patients coded 27506 into rigid versus flexible nail fixation groups. Additional data collected included patient age, fellowship training, and reported complications. Trends in management by patient age were evaluated by the following age groups:&#x2009;&lt;8, 8&#x2013;10, 11&#x2013;13, and&#x2009;&gt;13&#x2009;years old.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 3939 patients in the ABOS database underwent surgery for femoral shaft fractures as defined by CPT codes 27506 and 27507 from 2002 to 2021 by board examination candidates. Over this time, there was a trend toward increased rigid nail fixation in patients aged 11&#x2013;13 years at the expense of flexible nail fixation with plating remaining consistent in that age group. There is a particularly notable drop in flexible nail usage from 2009 to 2010 in the 11&#x2013;13 years age group. There is also a trend toward decreased flexible nail fixation in patients aged&#x2009;&lt;8 and 8&#x2013;10 although this is due to an increase in plating as rigid nail fixation appears to have stayed consistent.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Over the last 20&#x2009;years, there has been a trend toward rigid nail fixation over flexible nail fixation in patients aged 11&#x2013;13 years. We feel that this may be due to the benefits of rigid nail fixation including early weight bearing and decreased malunion risk, as well as the 2009 AAOS Clinical Practice Guideline recommendation against flexible nail fixation in patients older than 11&#x2009;years.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Rigid nail fixation of femoral shaft fractures is increasingly being used in the young adolescent population as a reliable alternative to flexible nail fixation with the notable benefits of early weight bearing and maintenance of reduction.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Femoral shaft fractures account for 1%&#x2013;2% of all pediatric fractures. Stimulation of growth following this fracture is a well-recognized phenomenon. However, most literature on this topic does not differentiate between &#x201C;catch up growth&#x201D; and overgrowth.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Patients with diaphyseal femur fractures between the age of 6&#x2009;months and 4&#x2009;years were prospectively enrolled and randomized to treatment with either a spica cast or a functional brace. Radiographs at time of injury were compared to those with 1-year follow-up and analyzed with regards to shortening and varus malalignment. Initial shortening was measured based on fracture overlap from the injury films, and 1 year shortening was measured in comparison to the contralateral femur. Patients who lacked a full-length hip to ankle film at 1 year after injury were excluded.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Forty-five patients met the inclusion criteria, mean age 2.23&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;0.9&#x2009;years. Twenty-four were treated in a functional brace, and 21 were treated with a spica. Femoral shortening at the time of injury was a mean of 6.05&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;7.3&#x2009;mm. At time of injury, 11 patients had&#x2009;&gt;10&#x2009;mm of shortening, of which 8 had 10&#x2013;20&#x2009;mm and 3 had&#x2009;&gt;20&#x2009;mm of shortening. At 1-year follow-up, femoral shortening was a mean of 0.8&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;3.2&#x2009;mm overall, for an increased growth of 0.5&#x2009;mm/month. In the subset of 11 patients with&#x2009;&gt;10&#x2009;mm of shortening, the mean shortening at 1&#x2009;year was 2.2&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;3.9&#x2009;mm for a rate of increased growth of 1.2&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;0.4&#x2009;mm/month. Rate of overgrowth was significantly higher in those that had more shortening (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01). At 1&#x2009;year, 8 patients had overgrowth and had a longer femoral shaft on the affected side by mean 4.05&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1.3&#x2009;mm. One of these patients had greater than 5&#x2009;mm of length compared to the contralateral side. There were no differences in fracture shortening between the spica and functional brace groups at the time of injury (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.47). There was a slight decrease in femoral shortening in the brace group as compared to the spica at 1-year follow-up (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.046, brace&#x2009;=&#x2009;&#x2212;0.1&#x2009;mm, spica&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.8&#x2009;mm), though likely not clinically significant.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Overall, the group experienced femoral overgrowth at a rate of 0.5&#x2009;mm/month following diaphyseal femur fracture in this prospective cohort. This rate was more than doubled in those with greater shortening.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> These numbers can be helpful to help guide parental and provider expectations following femur fractures in patients of ages 6&#x2009;months to 4&#x2009;years.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Premature physeal closure (PPC) after distal femur fractures is a recognized complication. To date, risk factors for PPC have not been well identified. The purpose of the current study was to identify nonmodifiable risk factors for this challenging clinical problem.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective review of all displaced distal femur physeal fractures undergoing surgical stabilization at a single level 1 pediatric hospital were identified between 2011 and 2022. Patient charts were reviewed and injury, radiographic, and surgical data were recorded. Univariable statistical analysis was performed to identify factors associated with PPC. Odds ratios were calculated, and binary logistic regression was utilized to determine the odds of PPC based on risk factors present.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Fifty-four patients were identified with a mean chronologic age of 13&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;3&#x2009;years and a mean bone age of 14&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;3. Most patients were male (67%) The distribution of physeal fractures by Salter-Harris Classification was as follows: SH-I&#x2009;=&#x2009;3, SH-II&#x2009;=&#x2009;19, SH-III&#x2009;=&#x2009;14, SH-IV&#x2009;=&#x2009;8. Twenty-right percent of the cohort presented with severe fracture displacement (fracture dislocation), 6% presented with an open fracture, and 4% with neurovascular compromise of the extremity. Interposed periosteum was removed in 37% of patients. The overall rate of PPC was 48% (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;26), and 77% of these (20/26) required subsequent surgical intervention. Even when the PPC was identified appropriately at the 6-month postinjury visit, 50% had already developed a leg length discrepancy of at least 1&#x2009;cm. Three nonmodifiable factors were significantly associated with PPC: bone age (&lt;15 for boys and&#x2009;&lt;13 for girls), Salter-Harris type (type 1 and 2), and fracture displacement (fracture dislocation, Table). The risk of PPC based on number of factors present compared to zero factors were 1 factor OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;4.4 (95% CI 0.4&#x2013;45, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.22), 2 factors OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;39 (95% CI 3.8&#x2013;399, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002), and 3 factors OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;96 (95% CI 5.2&#x2013;1767, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002). Patients with 2 and 3 risk factors had a 77% and 89% rate of closing early, respectively.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Premature physeal closure frequently occurs after distal femur fractures and risk factors include younger age, Salter-Harris 1 and 2 fractures, and fractures with greater initial displacement. When all three are present, there is a nearly 90% of closure.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> When multiple risk factors are present, the odds of PPC is high, and intervention before 6&#x2009;months could be considered to avoid a resultant leg length discrepancy or angular deformity. A larger study is warranted for creation of a predictive model and to enhance precision of the risk factor analysis.</p>

        <title>Do patient-answered versus parent-answered patient-reported outcomes differ in pediatric fracture care?</title>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) has become increasingly popular in the orthopedic setting. For patients aged 8&#x2013;17 years, PROMIS offers both self-report (which the child answers) and parent-proxy (which the parent answers on the child&#x2019;s behalf) forms. There is concern, however, for the possibility of disagreement between parent and child responses for each given domain. In the setting of pediatric fracture care, we questioned whether there would be a difference between the self-report and parent-proxy PROMIS results.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> We provided self-report questionnaires to patients aged 8&#x2013;17 years presenting for treatment of extremity fractures in a pediatric orthopedic clinic, and corresponding parent-proxy questionnaires to their parent/guardian. Both questionnaires consisted of 28 questions from 4 PROMIS domains: Physical Function&#x2014;Upper Extremity, Physical Function&#x2014;Mobility, Psychological Stress Experiences, and Pain&#x2014;Interference. For patients with upper-extremity fractures, the Physical Function&#x2014;Mobility domain was not analyzed. For patients with lower extremity fractures, the Physical Function&#x2014;Upper Extremity domain was not analyzed. A power analysis revealed that a minimum of 89 patients were needed to detect a Minimum Important Difference (MID) of 3&#x2009;T-score points between child and caregiver responses, with a power of 0.80 and type-I error rate of 5%.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> There were 119 patients (mean age 12.3, 30% female), 81 with upper-extremity and 38 with lower-extremity fractures. For the Pain Interference domain, the mean parent-proxy score was 2.86&#x2009;T-score points higher than the mean pediatric self-report score (Table). For the remainder of the measured domains, no significant differences were able to be detected.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These data indicate that parents in a pediatric fracture care setting rate their children slightly worse for pain and how pain interferes with daily activities compared to how their children rate themselves. However, this difference may not be clinically significant, given that the observed difference of 2.86 is slightly less than the MID of 3.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> These findings may have implications for pediatric fracture care settings in which providers wish to collect PROMIS patient-reported outcomes. Clinicians must use caution when choosing whether to administer the self-report or parent-proxy report, as the results between child and caregiver may differ, but perhaps not in a clinically meaningful way.</p>

        <p>LOE-Not Applicable-Level I</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Clinical trials of pediatric fractures seldom show differences based on patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), possibly because the PROMs do not adequately capture patients&#x2019;/parents&#x2019; perspectives about outcomes that matter. The Patient Reported Outcomes of Fracture Healing (PROOF) questionnaires are a new set of PROMs designed specifically for children&#x2019;s fractures. Derived from parents and patients, the PROOF includes 4 domains (Scores: 0&#x2013;100): &#x201C;How it Looks&#x2019;; &#x201C;How it Feels&#x201D;; &#x201C;How it Works&#x201D;; and &#x201C;How it Healed,&#x201D; which captures the overall recovery experience. This project evaluates the reliability, validity, and responsiveness of the PROOF-LE.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Children with lower-extremity fractures were prospectively enrolled. Parents and children (&gt;8 years) completed the parent and child versions of the PROOF-LE, respectively, at 3 time-points from treatment until full recovery. Test&#x2013;retest reliability (2&#x2009;weeks apart) was determined at final healing using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and internal consistency using Cronbach&#x2019;s Alpha. Convergent validity was assessed comparing the PROOF-LE to the PODCI using Pearson correlation. Construct validity was evaluated by comparing fractures with and without complications. Responsiveness (sensitivity to change) was evaluated over three time-points using standardized response means (SRM). Finally, parents&#x2019; scores were compared with their respective children&#x2019;s scores, using paired <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-test and Pearson correlation.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 335 children&#x2019;s (197 boys/138 girls; mean age (SD): 9.9 yrs. (4.4)) fractures of the pelvis/hip (4), femur (99), knee (24), tibia (141), ankle (40), and foot (27) were included. The PROOF-LE demonstrated moderate to excellent test&#x2013;retest reliability for the Total and domain scores for children (ICC: 0.75&#x2013;0.89) and parents (ICC: 0.69&#x2013;0.88) and high internal consistency for children (0.72&#x2013;0.9) and parents (0.72&#x2013;0.91). PROOF-LE domain scores correlated positively with like domains of the PODCI. As hypothesized, fractures with complications scored significantly worse than those without. The PROOF-LE was highly responsive with SRMs of 0.99 (parents) and 1.2 (children) for the total scores over three time-points. Parents&#x2019; scores correlated strongly with their children (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.89; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) with parents&#x2019; scores an average of 2.9 points lower than children&#x2019;s.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The child and parent versions of the PROOF-LE are reliable, internally consistent, valid, and responsive for lower-extremity fractures in children. The PROOF-LE may be considered as the PROM of choice for pediatric lower-extremity fractures and their treatments.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> The PROOF-LE is the only PROM designed specifically to measure outcomes of pediatric lower-extremity fractures and their treatments. The PROOF-LE reports scores across four different domains and in total, which allows it to better distinguish pros and cons of competing treatments, information about which will inform future decision-making about treatment choices.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Optimal treatment for buckle fractures is well documented and includes a removable wrist brace, but without any in-person follow-up or repeat radiographs. Despite this evidence, many patients in the USA still follow up with an orthopedic provider after initial diagnosis from the emergency department, urgent care, or primary care provider. Here, we sought to determine whether an all-home management of buckle fractures, without an in-person visit with an orthopedic provider, would reduce the impact of treatment on patients and caregivers without reducing patient reported outcomes or patient satisfaction.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> At a single institution in the USA, randomized control trial was conducted on children (age&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;18) diagnosed with a distal radius buckle fracture. Subjects were identified by referrals from local emergency departments, urgent care, or primary care providers. Radiographs were reviewed by one of three pediatric orthopedic surgeons to confirm the diagnosis. Subjects were randomized into two groups: in-person management or home-management through video education. The in-person management group subsequently had an in-person visit with an orthopedic provider at our institution. The home-management group did not have an in-person visit with an orthopedic provider and was instead given access to a 90-second educational video created by the authors and posted on YouTube, explaining the nature of buckle fractures and treatment, instructed on where to purchase a wrist brace, and given a standardized note for school. Outcome metrics included the PROMIS Upper Extremity Pediatric Short Form, overall satisfaction, minutes spent on healthcare education, minutes spent on healthcare activities, minutes missed from work, and minutes missed from school. All outcomes between groups were examined using a two-sided <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-test.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Preliminary analysis of the first 23 patients (11 home-management and 12 control) demonstrated no difference in PROMIS score improvement (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.704), minutes missed from school (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.215), satisfaction (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.169), or minutes spent on healthcare education (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.165). Home-management was superior in minutes missed from work (10.9&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;36.2 vs 173.3&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;294, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.042) and minutes spent on healthcare activities (51.8&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;48.1 vs 144.5&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;97.0, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.005).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Home management of buckle fractures without an orthopedic office visit results in less time missed from work and less time spent on healthcare activities, without a negative effect of patient-reported outcomes or patient satisfaction.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> In the USA, buckle fractures can be successfully managed with a short YouTube video in place of an in-person office visit with an orthopedic provider.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Open reduction (OR) for DDH is indicated when conservative treatment and/or closed reduction is unsuccessful. Most prior investigations on adverse outcomes have focused on proximal femoral growth arrest, re-dislocation, and residual dysplasia. To our knowledge, no previous study has investigated risk factors for stiffness, which is an underappreciated source of postoperative morbidity. The goal of this study is to evaluate the prevalence and risk factors for arthrofibrosis following OR for DDH.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted on all open hip reductions performed by a single surgeon from 2009 to 2022. Cases were identified using CPT codes/billing records. Patients with spastic or teratologic hips or less than 1-year follow-up were excluded. Radiographic measurements collected included acetabular index, superior displacement (relative to Hilgenreiner&#x2019;s line), and International Hip Dysplasia Institute (IHDI) grade. Mild arthrofibrosis was defined as premature cessation of postoperative bracing due to range of motion (ROM) concerns and/or referral to PT with resolution of stiffness within 6&#x2009;months. Significant arthrofibrosis was defined as greater than 6 months of formal PT for persistent ROM concerns and/or manipulation under anesthesia with/without inpatient rehabilitation admission. Statistical analysis was performed using multivariable logistic regression and ROC curve analysis.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Of the 172-patient cohort, 149 (86.6%) were female. The median age at surgery was 1.54&#x2009;years (IQR: 0.78&#x2013;2.24), and median follow-up was 3.13&#x2009;years (IQR: 1.88&#x2013;5.35). Sixty-six patients (38%) had a concomitant pelvic osteotomy, and 34 (19.8%) had both pelvic and femoral osteotomies. During the postoperative course, 111 patients (64.5%) had &#x201C;no&#x201D; stiffness, 38 (22.1%) had mild stiffness, and 23 (13.4%) had significant arthrofibrosis. Of this latter group, all had&#x2009;&gt;6&#x2009;months of PT; 7 patients had a manipulation under anesthesia, and 2 had an inpatient rehabilitation admission. On multivariate analysis, concomitant osteotomies (pelvic alone or femoral/pelvic) were risk factors for significant arthrofibrosis (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01). OR after an age of 1.7&#x2009;years increased the risk of significant arthrofibrosis by 2.1 times (area under the curve (AUC)&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.85).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Older age and concomitant osteotomies are risk factors for significant arthrofibrosis after OR for DDH. Children older than 20&#x2009;months of age have an increased risk of developing significant stiffness postoperatively.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Surgeons who perform hip OR for DDH after 20&#x2009;months of age with planned osteotomies should counsel families about the risk of postoperative stiffness, which was significant in 13% of our patients.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Potential complications of open hip reduction are avascular necrosis (AVN) and residual dysplasia. The literature is abundant describing these sequelae in developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH), although limited in describing and comparing rates in arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC). We performed a dual-center retrospective cohort study to compare rates of AVN and residual dysplasia after open hip reduction between DDH and AMC for nontraumatic hip dislocations.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A total of 121 patients (147 hips) younger than 18&#x2009;years underwent open reduction of hip dislocations between 1981 and 2020 at two large tertiary pediatric hospitals. Patients with AMC were matched by age against DDH 1:2. Preoperative data included demographics, etiology, degree of hip dislocation/dysplasia by IHDI classification, and acetabular index (AI). Outcomes included rate of osteotomies, reoperations, and presence/stage of AVN by Salter Criteria at 2&#x2009;years postoperatively, and by Kalamachi and Macewen (KM) classification at last follow-up prior to skeletal maturity. Poor AVN grades were considered Salter Criteria 1,2 and KM 3,4. Categorical variables were compared by Fisher&#x2019;s exact test/chi-square, and relative risk was reported. Significance was set at p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Eighty-two patients (98 hips) had DDH, and 39 patients (49 hips) had arthrogryposis, with mean follow-up of 97&#x2009;months (range: 24&#x2013;443). There was no difference in mean age at surgery (1.46 vs 1.43&#x2009;years; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.86), but the DDH cohort had more females (83% vs 56%; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.003). There was no significant difference between cohorts in preoperative IHDI, AI, or spica cast duration (all p&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.05). However, DDH cohort underwent more pelvic osteotomies (34% vs 14%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01). Postoperatively, the incidence of AVN was 21% (21/98) in DDH and 57% (28/49) in arthrogryposis by Salter criteria (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001); 35% (35/98) in DDH and 71% (35/49) in arthrogryposis by KM (p&#x2009;=*). Compared to DDH, patients with arthrogryposis had 8.0&#xD7; increased risk of Salter Criteria 1,2 (24% vs 3%; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) and 3.1&#xD7; increased risk of KM grade 3,4 (41% vs 13%; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). At 2&#x2009;years postoperatively, there was no difference in AI (31&#xB0; vs 29&#xB0;, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.3) or reoperation rate (24% DDH vs 20%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.7), but DDH cohort had more IHDI grade 1 hips than arthrogryposis (91% vs 75%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Open reduction for hip dysplasia in arthrogryposis has significantly higher rate of AVN than DDH, but no difference in rate of residual dysplasia at 2-year follow-up.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This is the first study to compare outcomes of open hip reduction between DDH and arthrogryposis and guides perioperative counseling about sequelae for families of patients with arthrogryposis.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Developmental Hip Dysplasia (DDH) affects 1&#x2013;30:1000 children and is a preventable cause of disability if diagnosed early. The Pavlik harness is the most used treatment method up to 6&#x2009;months of age and aims to promote the normal development of the proximal femur and acetabulum, with rates of avascular necrosis of 0.8%&#x2013;6% and residual dysplasia of 3%&#x2013;17%. In this study, we aimed to determine the rate of residual dysplasia and osteonecrosis in infants with DDH who completed treatment with Pavlik harness.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> This is a retrospective study including DDH patients diagnosed in 2008&#x2013;2012 and treated in a single institution with Pavlik. A total of 281 patients were identified. Demographic, clinical, and imaging data were collected. Patients with incomplete data (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;61); irreducible hips after 2&#x2013;3&#x2009;weeks of treatment (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;19); treatment noncompliance (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;1); and absence of follow-up after 18&#x2009;months of age (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;44) were excluded.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> One hundred seventy-five patients were included; 84.6% were female. Median age at first consultation was 3 (0.25&#x2013;10) months. Of all, 73.5% had cephalic presentation, and 10.8% had family history of DDH; 37.1% had bilateral DDH. In unilateral DDH, the left side was the most affected region (75%). Treatment with Pavlik started at a median age of 4&#x2009;months (0.5&#x2013;10) and had median duration 4&#x2009;months (1&#x2013;11). Avascular necrosis of the femoral head, Kalamchi I, occurred in 5 (2.86%) patients. With a median follow-up of 52&#x2009;months (13&#x2013;147), residual dysplasia was observed in 4 (2.28%) patients. Of these, 3 (1.71%) children underwent Salter osteotomy at a median age of 47&#x2009;months (24&#x2013;47).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In a large cohort of infants with DDH treated with Pavlik, avascular necrosis and residual dysplasia were rare. Only 1.71% of patients required surgery.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Pavlik harness is a safe and effective treatment method in the early management of DDH.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> In patients with symptomatic hip dysplasia, high hip contact stresses lead to accelerated development of osteoarthritis. Prior finite element analysis (FEA) studies have estimated in vivo contact mechanics through computational simulations, demonstrating that periacetabular osteotomy (PAO) can correct acetabular dysplasia and restore healthy joint contact mechanics. However, the effect of concomitant femoral deformities on hip contact stresses remains unknown. This study aimed to quantify the effect of femoral deformity on hip contact stresses during functional activities in patients with symptomatic hip dysplasia using FEA.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> We included 30 patients (26 female, 4 male) with symptomatic hip dysplasia. Three-dimensional patient-specific FEA models were created from preoperative high-resolution computed tomography scans. Virtual PAO (anterior and lateral center-edge angle 30&#xB0;) was first performed for each patient before simulating hip contact mechanics for nine different femoral deformities in 2&#xB0; increments: (1) no deformity, (2) anteversion, (3) retroversion, (4) valgus, (5) varus, (6) combined anteversion and varus, (7) combined anteversion and valgus, (8) combined retroversion and varus, and (9) combined retroversion and valgus. All simulations were performed under physiological joint loading during 3 functional activities. <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-Test was used to identify the degree of femoral deformity that leads to significant increase in acetabular contact stresses, when compared to the femur without deformity.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Femoral anteversion had the largest effect on hip contact stresses compared to femoral retroversion (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01), femoral valgus (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01), and femoral varus (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01). Compared to a femur without deformity, during single-leg deep lunge, 8&#xB0; of isolated anteversion increased posterior-medial hip contact pressures (6.9&#x2009;MPa vs 6.1&#x2009;MPa, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02), 14&#xB0; of valgus increased posterior-lateral contact pressures (5.7&#x2009;MPa vs 5.2&#x2009;MPa, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.03), 14&#xB0; of varus increased posterior-medial contact pressures (6.7&#x2009;MPa vs 6.1&#x2009;MPa, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.03), and 16&#xB0; of retroversion increased posterior hip contact pressures (5.6&#x2009;MPa vs 5.2&#x2009;MPa, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.04), whereas 2&#xB0; of anteversion combined with 8&#xB0; of valgus or 10&#xB0; of varus resulted in increased posterior-medial hip contact pressures (7.2&#x2009;MPa vs 6.1&#x2009;MPa, 7.0&#x2009;MPa vs 6.1&#x2009;MPa, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01; Figure 1), and 4&#xB0; of retroversion combined with 6&#xB0; varus or 8&#xB0; valgus increased posterior-medial hip contact pressures (7.0&#x2009;MPa vs 6.1&#x2009;MPa, 6.9&#x2009;MPa vs 6.1&#x2009;MPa, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Smaller degrees of femoral deformity when present in combination produced significant elevations in hip contact stresses, comparable to larger degrees of isolated femoral deformity. Further studies are needed to guide whether femoral osteotomy may be beneficial in addition to periacetabular osteotomy in patients with symptomatic hip dysplasia.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This computational modeling study quantifies the degree of femoral deformity that may require surgical correction due to harmful increases in hip contact pressures during functional activities.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Residual acetabular dysplasia at skeletal maturity is an important risk factor for developing early-onset osteoarthritis. Therefore, screening and treatment of acetabular dysplasia is important during infancy and childhood for hip preservation. Historical concepts of hip dysplasia commencing in infancy and naturally improving throughout growth are challenged by more recent studies. These studies point out that acetabular dysplasia can also develop later during childhood and then remain undiagnosed and untreated. Current prevalence of acetabular dysplasia during adolescence and the corresponding extend of this problem remains unknown. The primary aim of this research is to estimate prevalence numbers in a large sample of healthy, Dutch adolescents. The secondary aim is to evaluate the correlation between various radiological measurements for acetabular dysplasia.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A sample of the unique, ongoing multiethnic prospective population-based cohort &#x201C;Generation R,&#x201D; which follows children from birth until adulthood, was used. As a part of this cohort study, a high-resolution dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) of the right hip and total body was made at the age of approximately 13&#x2009;years. These DXA images were used for automatic and previously validated measurement of the lateral center-edge angle (LCEA), extrusion index (EI), modified acetabular index (mAI), and acetabular depth-width ratio (ADR). For calculation of prevalence, acetabular dysplasia was defined as LCEA&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;20&#xB0;.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> In 3993 participants with a mean age of 13.54&#x2009;years (range 12.59&#x2013;16.64), both a DXA of the right hip and total body were available. Of these participants, 53.2% were female, and 25.0% were skeletally immature (triradiate cartilage not yet fused). The prevalence of acetabular dysplasia is 7.33% for the complete group. In females, this prevalence is 5.3%, and in males, 9.6%. In the subgroup of skeletally immature, mainly male participants (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;995), the prevalence is 10.1%. Correlation between the various radiographic measurements is shown in figure 1.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Acetabular dysplasia is present in 7.31% of healthy Dutch adolescents, with a higher prevalence in males than in females and higher prevalence in skeletally immature participants. Radiographic measurement of LCEA and EI correlate fairly well, while correlation of mAI and ADR with LCEA is poor.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> The identification of acetabular dysplasia is important for joint preservation. The suggestion that acetabular dysplasia might develop later in childhood warrants further research in this field. This is the first large-scale study reporting the prevalence of acetabular dysplasia in adolescents from the general population.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> The Salter and Pemberton osteotomies are two common surgical procedures to treat developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH). Accurate data regarding hip surface contact pressure after these two procedures are missing in the literature. This study aimed to compare the surface contact pressure of the hip before and after a Salter or Pemberton osteotomy with that of a group of normal hips and a group of dysplastic controls.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> The surface contact pressure of 70 hips was determined using the HipStress program, a nomogram using geometric (radiographic) and biometric (Body Mass Index) parameters. When this program yields a peak contact pressure of less than 2&#x2009;MPa, it is considered a normal value. Forty-five hips had undergone an osteotomy for acetabular dysplasia (17 Salter osteotomies and 28 Pemberton osteotomies). We also analyzed 15 dysplastic controls and 10 healthy hips as a control group. The statistical analysis included independent <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-tests and ANOVA for comparing means between different groups, Pearson correlation for assessing associations between continuous variables, Spearman correlation for non-normally distributed or ordinal data, and paired <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-tests or Wilcoxon signed-rank tests for within-group comparisons before and after surgery. The mean age at the time of final analysis was 14.3&#x2009;years (range 12.1&#x2013;17.6).</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> The mean HipStress result for healthy hips was 1.66&#x2009;MPa, and for dysplastic controls, it was 8.9 MPa. For hips that had undergone a Salter osteotomy, it was 2.9&#x2009;MPa postoperatively vs 7.6&#x2009;MPa preoperatively (&#x394;&#x2009;=&#x2009;&#x2212;4.7&#x2009;MPa). The hips that had undergone a Pemberton osteotomy were 3.1&#x2009;MPa postoperatively vs 8.6&#x2009;MPa preoperatively (&#x394;&#x2009;=&#x2009;&#x2212;5.5&#x2009;MPa). The difference between the preoperative and postoperative results was statistically significant for the Salter osteotomy group (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.03) and the Pemberton osteotomy group (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.04).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The Salter and Pemberton osteotomies can potentially reduce the surface contact pressure of the hip in patients with acetabular dysplasia. However, the surface contact pressure remains higher than that for normal controls.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> The reduction in the surface contact pressure of the hip after Salter and Pemberton osteotomies should translate into a longer-lasting joint.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> We investigated the impact of femoral version (FV) on postoperative clinical outcomes following periacetabular osteotomy (PAO) in adolescents and young adults with symptomatic acetabular dysplasia.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> This is a retrospective institutional review board (IRB)-approved study of patients undergoing PAO for treatment of symptomatic acetabular dysplasia between January 2010 and December 2018. We collected demographic, imaging, and preoperative/postoperative patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs: modified Harris Hip Score (mHHS), Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS)) from patients with a minimum 1-year follow-up. Femoral version was classified as normal (5&#xB0;-20&#xB0;), increased version (&gt;&#x2009;20&#xB0;), and retroversion (&lt;&#x2009;5&#xB0;). Beta-binomial regression analyzed the association between FV and postoperative PROMs. Statistical analyses involved beta-binomial and linear regression and logistic regression.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 271 patients (mean age 26.7&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;9.4&#x2009;years, 90% female) were analyzed. Significant improvements (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05) were observed across all PROMs, with 72% achieving minimal clinically important differences (MCID) for mHHS and 55%&#x2013;79% for HOOS subscales (Table 1). Although all groups experienced improvement, retroverted patients were less likely to attain MCID on mHHS (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.3, 95% CI: 0.11&#x2013;0.72; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.009) and HOOS-Pain (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.3, 95% CI: 0.10&#x2013;0.85; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.026) than those with normal FV. Patients with retroversion exhibited lower odds of achieving higher postoperative mHHS (51% lower) and HOOS scores (44%&#x2013;63% lower) than those with normal FV (all p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). Furthermore, retroversion patients also showed significantly lower mean score changes on all PROMs than those with normal FV (all p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). No statistically significant differences (p&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.05) were observed in PROMs between patients with increased vs those with normal FV.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> While clinical improvement can be anticipated following PAO across all FV categories, patients with femoral retroversion may potentially experience less pronounced improvement than those with normal FV.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Our data suggest that patients with preoperative femoral retroversion can achieve meaningful clinical improvement after PAO; however, not as extensive as patients with normal FV. Our findings can help guide patient counseling and preoperative surgical planning in patients with femoral retroversion and acetabular dysplasia undergoing PAO. Future studies should investigate whether modification of surgical planning should include increasing the acetabular version to compensate for the combined version (McKibbin index) or if adding a femoral derotational osteotomy can enhance the improvement after PAO in patients with femoral retroversion.</p>

        <p>LOE-Diagnostic-Level II</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Understanding of femoro-acetabular impingement (FAI) continues to improve. Low-dose computed tomography (CT) is increasingly utilized due to its improved ability to characterize the complex and variable hip morphologies of different FAI patients, compared to plain radiographs. This study defined FAI morphology in adolescents and compared males and females utilizing low-dose CT.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A multicenter, prospective cohort of FAI patients undergoing arthroscopy was performed. Patients aged 14&#x2013;18.9&#x2009;years were the focus of the current study. All patients underwent low-dose CT for preoperative planning with radiation exposure, similar to 3&#x2013;4 anteroposterior (AP) pelvis radiographs. Localization with a clock face was utilized (3:00 was anterior and 9:00 posterior). Univariate analysis and multivariable regression were used to determine differences between male and female groups.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 696 hips were registered with 27.9% (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;194) being adolescent. Utilizing low-dose CT, males had higher alpha angles at 76.7&#xB0;&#xB1;&#x2009;10.3&#xB0; than females 63.9&#xB0;&#xB1;&#x2009;10.1&#xB0; (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). The largest difference was noted at 1:00 and was 72.9&#xB0;&#xB1;&#x2009;10.7&#xB0; for males compared to 56.6&#xB0;&#xB1;&#x2009;11.5&#xB0; for females (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Furthermore, when classified into alpha angles of&#x2009;&lt;55&#xB0;, 55&#xB0;&#x2013;62.9&#xB0;, and&#x2009;&#x2265;63&#xB0;, female distribution was 17.3%, 32.7%, and 50%, and male distribution was 1.5%, 4.4%, and 94.1%, respectively (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0001). The location of maximal alpha angle was more anterior in females at 1:21&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;0:37 and 1:07&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;0:42, respectively (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002). Females had higher femoral version at 19.1&#xB0;&#xB1;&#x2009;8.7&#xB0; than at 15.4&#xB0;&#xB1;&#x2009;8.4&#xB0; (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.005). Femoral neck-shaft angle was higher in females at 134.4&#xB0;&#xB1;&#x2009;4.2&#xB0; than at 131.7&#xB0;&#xB1;&#x2009;4.4&#xB0; Acetabular coverage at 10:30 was higher for females at 61.2%&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;3.2% than for males at 58.5%&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;2.9% (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Acetabular coverage at 1:30 was lower for females with 57.1%&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;3.3% than for males with 59.2%&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;3.1% (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Cranial (1:30) and central (3:00) acetabular version was about 3&#x2009;degrees higher for females than for males (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). Regression analysis demonstrated that females had increased acetabular coverage at 10:30 (OR: 1.30, CI: 1.06&#x2013;1.61, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.014) and males had increased femoral head diameter (OR: 1.94, CI: 1.49&#x2013;2.53, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) and increased alpha angles at 1:30 (OR: 1.08, CI: 1.02&#x2013;1.14, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.011).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Adolescent males and females with symptomatic FAI have significant differences in FAI morphology that are important to recognize. Females have 2.1% less anterior coverage, 2.7% more posterior coverage, about 3&#xB0; higher cranial and central version, 3.7&#xB0; higher femoral version, 12.8&#xB0; lower maximum alpha angle, a more anterior cam location, and 2.7&#xB0; higher femoral neck-shaft angle.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> CT has recently been recognized as a supplement to plain radiographs for assessing morphology of FAI. Differences between CT morphologic findings for males and females were presented.</p>

        <p>LOE-Prognostic-Level II</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> There has been a growing number of in vivo imaging and cadaveric studies, suggesting potential hip translations. A recent MRI study has shown an average translation of 2&#x2009;mm, with up to 7-mm translations in certain positions, among subjects with asymptomatic hips. Such translations can completely change hip contact and impingement patterns, affecting treatment plans. However, we know little about how hip translation may influence hip impingement. Here we used a validated simulation platform, to map the trajectory of the hip center of rotation (COR) and its effects on impingement-free hip range of motion.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Following IRB approval, CT scans of 611 subjects with no documented bone and joint pathology were obtained (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;1222 hips, age: 30.4&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;8.8; 67% males). A validated program (VirtualHip) was used to automatically develop 3D models of hip bones and simulate common hip rotations. The simulations were first done assuming a fixed hip COR (no translation) and then repeated by incrementally allowing the hip COR to translate by up to 5&#x2009;mm, avoiding bone-to-bone penetration or hip dislocation.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Hip flexion was associated with COR posterior (by 4.0&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;0.9&#x2009;mm), lateral (only after 100&#xB0;, by 3.6&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1.4&#x2009;mm), and superior (only after 100&#xB0;, by 2.0&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1.8&#x2009;mm) translations (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001; Figure 1). Hip extension was only associated with anterior COR translation (by 0.8&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;0.7&#x2009;mm, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Hip adduction was associated with anterior (by 2.9&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1.3&#x2009;mm), lateral (by 4.0&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1.3&#x2009;mm), and superior (by 4.4&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;0.6&#x2009;mm) translations (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01). Hip abduction was only associated with medial (by 2.6&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1.5&#x2009;mm) and inferior (by 2.9&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1.7&#x2009;mm) translations (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.02). There were minimal COR translations during hip internal rotations (p&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.05). Hip external rotation was associated with anterior (by 3.7&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1.4&#x2009;mm) and inferior (by 1.2&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1.3&#x2009;mm) translations (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Findings highlight the importance of hip translation (nonfixed COR) on the physiologic hip range of motion. As hip is not a perfect ball-and-socket joint with an aspherical femoral head, translation is required to accommodate physiologic rotation (e.g. glide mechanism) without bony impingement. These preliminary observations also highlight the need for a comprehensive assessment of normal and pathologic hip translation along with their role in biomechanics, injury risk, and response to treatment.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> A clear understanding of the role of hip translation in hip function and health will improve clinical care through better diagnosis and personalized treatment planning, which can ultimately lead to improved treatment outcomes.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Femoro-acetabular impingement (FAI) is the abnormal contact between the femoral head and acetabulum and can lead to damage and early hip labral and cartilage degeneration even in the adolescent patient. Unfortunately, most insurance companies require growth plate closure prior to surgical intervention despite evidence that nonphyseal preserving arthroscopic techniques can be safely utilized in skeletally immature patients. The following study investigates outcomes arthroscopic management of symptomatic FAI patients with open growth plates compared to a match-paired control group.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Data were prospectively collected and retrospectively reviewed for patients who underwent arthroscopy between December 2009 and January 2021. Patients with open proximal femoral growth plates at time of surgery and Risser stage&#x2009;&#x2264;4 on preoperative radiographs who underwent treatment for FAI and a labral tear, completed preoperative patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and visual analog scale (VAS) for pain at 2-year minimum follow-up were included. Previous ipsilateral hip conditions, LCEA&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;18&#x2009;degrees, previous ipsilateral surgery, or preoperative Tonnis grade&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;1 were excluded. Patients with open physes were matched to PROs compared to patients with closed physes by using a 1:1 ratio by age at the time of surgical procedure within 10&#x2009;years, BMI, and sex.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Forty hips (31 patients) with open physes (OP) were matched with 40 hips (30pts) with closed physes (CP). The mean age of the OP group and control group was 15.2 and 15.47&#x2009;years (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.342). The mean duration of symptoms was significantly greater for the OP group (OP 14.63&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1.93&#x2009;months; CP 9.60&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1.30&#x2009;months; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). There was no significant difference in the 2-year postoperative &#x3B1;-angles (OP 45.71&#xB0;, CP 42.29&#xB0;; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0623). There were no significant differences in 2-year postoperative PROs for the mHHS (OP 65.18; CP 59.92; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0704), NAHS (OP 68.30; CP 64.32; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.270), and VAS (OP 5.07; CP 5.95; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.165). In the OP group, 0% (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;0) of patients underwent revision arthroscopy versus the control group of which 5.0% (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;2) of patients underwent revision arthroscopy. There was no evidence cam regrowth in all patients at 2&#x2009;years. One patient had cam regrowth 4 years after femoroplasty in the OP group.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Patients undergoing arthroscopic surgery for FAI with open growth plates have similar improvement in PROs compared to skeletally mature patients without radiographic evidence of cam regrowth at 2 years postoperatively. However, patients with open growth plates had significantly greater preoperative duration of symptoms.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Arthroscopic management of FAI in patients with open growth plates is safe with similar outcomes to skeletally mature patients. Closed growth plates should not be required for insurance approval of arthroscopic surgery of FAI.</p>

        <p>LOE-Not Applicable-Level II</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> A periacetabular osteotomy (PAO) seeks to improve native hip function in patients with prearthritic dysplasia. Fulfillment of expectations has been shown to influence postoperative satisfaction in spine surgery and knee arthroplasty but has not been investigated for PAOs. This study analyzes relationships between preoperative patient and surgeon expectations, patient-reported postoperative outcomes, and satisfaction at long-term follow-up in young adult PAO patients.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Patients undergoing a PAO from October 2012 to April 2014 with one of two orthopedic surgeons (MBM, YJK) at a tertiary care center were asked to enroll. Patients and surgeons each completed a preoperative survey indicating their expectations on a Likert-type scale (not improved&#x2014;greatly improved) in six domains: pain, stability, stiffness, walking, locking/catching, and athletics. At 7&#x2013;9&#x2009;years after PAO, patients reported outcomes on the same Likert-type scales. Patients were also asked about satisfaction (very dissatisfied&#x2014;very satisfied) in each domain and overall helpfulness of the PAO (extremely unhelpful&#x2014;extremely helpful). Change between preoperative expectation and long-term outcome was assessed using the Wilcoxon signed rank test for paired ordinal data for each domain. The association between expectations/outcomes alignment with satisfaction and perceived helpfulness of PAO was assessed with Spearman rank correlation.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Sixty-five patients completed the preoperative expectations and follow-up survey, in addition to completion of the preoperative expectations survey by the surgeon. Average age at PAO was 26.5&#x2009;years. Follow-up surveys were completed at median 8&#x2009;years following PAO. Pain, stability, and walking ability, the three domains that were most important to patients, are shown in Figure 1: The distribution of paired patient expectations and outcomes are in Figure 1a, and paired surgeon expectations and outcomes are in Figure 1b. The alignment of patient expectations with reported outcomes tends to be stronger than surgeon expectations with the same reported outcomes. Alignment between patient expectations and long-term outcomes was found to correlate with long-term satisfaction for all domains (all p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05), with the strongest correlation in the pain domain (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.46; 95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.24&#x2013;0.63; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Alignment between patient expectations and long-term outcomes was also found to correlate with perceived helpfulness of the PAO for all domains (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05) except for walking ability and stiffness.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Regardless of preoperative expectation level, patients whose expectations align with their outcomes are generally more satisfied and perceive their procedure as more helpful than those with misaligned expectations and outcomes.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Alignment between patient expectations and outcomes plays a crucial role in postoperative satisfaction.</p>

        <p>LOE-Diagnostic-Level III</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Bernese periacetabular osteotomy (PAO) for symptomatic acetabular dysplasia and femoro-acetabular impingement has become one of the most common invasive elective orthopedic surgeries in the United States. The rate of major neurologic injury (excluding lateral femoral cutaneous nerve injury) during PAO has been reported between 0% and 15%. While some surgeons recommend the use of intraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM) to mitigate risk of major neurologic injury during PAO, IONM has not become the standard of care. The purpose of this study was to report the incidence and clinical significance of IONM alerts in a single-surgeon, consecutive cohort of patients treated with Bernese PAO.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Following a permanent peripheral nerve injury during a PAO in August 2017 without IONM, IONM has been used at our institution in every PAO. Motor-evoked potentials and somatosensory monitoring is performed in bilateral upper and lower extremities throughout the procedure. We conducted a retrospective review of all PAOs performed after this practice change between August 2017 and April 2023 at a tertiary care children&#x2019;s hospital in the United States. Medical records were reviewed for all IONM alerts, surgical team responses to alerts, and postoperative neurologic status.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> All 94 patients who underwent PAO with IONM during the study period were included. Mean age at the time of surgery was 19&#x2009;years (range 7&#x2013;38). Nine of 94 patients (10%) had significant IONM alerts. Of these nine alerts, five resulted in action taken by the surgical team including adjustment of acetabular fragment correction, adjustment of retractor placement, limb repositioning, or stockinette/cohesive bandage loosening. The remaining four alerts were due to anesthetic/systemic causes or technical issues with the neuromonitoring electrodes. None of the nine patients had a detectible neurologic deficit postoperatively.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Intraoperative neuromonitoring during PAO may produce alerts in up to 10% of patients. These alerts are actionable and may improve patient safety and minimize the nonnegligible risk of major neurologic injury.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Previous publications have recommended the addition of IONM as standard practice during PAO, but its use has not become universal among PAO surgeons as it has among spine surgeons, despite comparable alert rates of approximately 10%. This study provides additional evidence to support the utility of IONM in PAO.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Legg-Calv&#xE9;-Perthes disease (LCPD) progresses through four stages characterized by unique radiographic features, and stage duration is recognized as an important prognostic factor. Newer perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (pMRI) allows for evaluation of vascularity early in the disease process. This study aims to describe the relationship between global and regional perfusion patterns on early pMRI and duration of Waldenstr&#xF6;m stages. A secondary aim was to verify the relationship between hypoperfusion and subsequent lateral pillar class.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Through a prospectively collected multicenter international cohort study, patients with early LCPD (Waldenstr&#xF6;m Stage I) and pMRI were followed with serial radiographs at 3-month intervals for a minimum of 2&#x2009;years. Epiphyseal hypoperfusion was quantified by HipVasc Software for the entire epiphysis and regional thirds of the femoral head. Waldenstr&#xF6;m stages and lateral pillar class were determined by mode assessments from three pediatric orthopedic surgeons. Duration of stage was defined as the interval between the first radiograph demonstrating features of stage IIa and stage IIIa for fragmentation and between IIIa and IV for reossification.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> One-hundred and seven patients (88.8% male, median age 8.0&#x2009;years) met study criteria. Average global hypoperfusion was 73.7%. Poorer global perfusion was predictive of longer duration of fragmentation (rho&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.34, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) and of reossification (rho&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.38, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.003). Based on our model, for every 10% decrease in global perfusion, the duration of fragmentation increased by approximately 18&#x2009;days. The average regional hypoperfusion of the medial, central, and lateral third of the femoral head was 65.3%, 83.7%, and 61.3%, respectively, and was similarly related to duration of fragmentation (rho&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.26, 0.24, and 0.31, respectively) and of reossification (rho&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.31, 0.43, and 0.39, respectively) (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05 for all). Like previous studies, we found a significant positive association between hypoperfusion in the lateral third of the femoral head and lateral pillar class (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.037).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The degree of both global and regional hypoperfusion correlated with duration of fragmentation and reossification stages in LCPD. Lateral epiphyseal hypoperfusion is predictive of lateral pillar class.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Although it represents just a single snapshot in time, pMRI offers important prognostic information in LCPD. Global and regional hypoperfusion clearly correlated with the duration of both fragmentation and reossification stages, and lateral hypoperfusion correlated with lateral pillar classification. This information is valuable to stratify disease severity, determine which patients may benefit most from early intervention, and counsel families about the expected disease course.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Perfusion MRI can quantify femoral head hypoperfusion at an early stage of Legg-Calv&#xE9;-Perthes disease (LCPD). We investigated if the severity of hypoperfusion of the femoral head obtained at the early-stage of LCPD correlates with femoral head deformity, as measured by the sphericity deviation score (SDS), at an intermediate-term follow-up.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Sixty-four patients aged 5&#x2013;11&#x2009;years at the diagnosis of LCPD with perfusion MRI performed at an early stage (Waldenstr&#xF6;m Stage 1 to 2a) and followed up until at least the healed stage (Stage 4) were retrospectively reviewed. Twenty-nine patients were treated nonoperatively and 35 with proximal femoral varus osteotomy (PFVO). The SDS was used as the primary outcome. Femoral head hypoperfusion and SDS were measured by two independent observers. Relationship models between hypoperfusion and SDS were fitted without and with stratifications by age at diagnosis and treatment method.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> All 64 patients had a minimum 4-year follow-up with the mean follow-up duration of 7.5&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;2.6&#x2009;years. At the final follow-up, their mean age was 15.5&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;2.9&#x2009;years, and 40 of them (62.5%) had reached skeletal maturity. The SDS outcome showed a significant positive correlation with the hypoperfusion percent (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). SDS indicated none to low deformity with narrow variability in the low hypoperfusion range (&lt;50%). SDS became exponentially worse with a wider variability at&#x2009;&gt;50% hypoperfusion range (figure). Similar correlation pattern was observed when patients were stratified by age at diagnosis or treatment method. Multivariate analyses revealed age at diagnosis, hypoperfusion percent, and treatment method as significant prognostic factors for SDS (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.005,&#x2009;&lt;0.001, and 0.017, respectively). When treatment outcomes were stratified by age at diagnosis and hypoperfusion, PFVO showed significantly better SDS outcome than nonoperative treatment in patients with the age at diagnosis&#x2009;&gt;8&#x2009;years and low (&lt;50%) and intermediate (50%&#x2013;80%) hypoperfusion ranges (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.036 and 0.021, respectively).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our study found a significant correlation between femoral head hypoperfusion at an early stage of LCPD and femoral head deformity at an intermediate-term follow-up. For patients aged&#x2009;&gt;8&#x2009;years with low-to-intermediate (&lt;&#x2009;80%) hypoperfusion, PFVO was beneficial to the SDS outcome.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This study supports femoral head hypoperfusion obtained at an early stage of LCPD as an early prognosticator of outcome. Our findings provide new insights into the relationship between the early-stage femoral head hypoperfusion and femoral head deformity.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Legg-Calve-Perthes disease (LCP) is most frequently classified using Herring&#x2019;s classification. Data from the literature show that, regardless of age, Herring A hips have good outcomes and only require observation. Herring C hips result in aspherical heads with or without surgery. Groups B and B/C may benefit from surgery, if diagnosed over the age of 8 years; however, the indications and surgical techniques remain vague and are based on surgeon preferences. Therapeutic recommendations for cases diagnosed between 6 and 8&#x2009;years remain inconclusive, constituting a clinical gray area. The aim of this study is to determine the relationship between therapeutic modalities and the final outcome for each category.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A multicentric IRB-approved retrospective study was conducted on 311 hips Herring B, B/C, and C, which were further divided into 3 groups based on literature. Group 1 included patients who, according to literature, could benefit from surgery:&#x2009;&lt;6&#x2009;years Herring B, B/C, and C and&#x2009;&gt;8&#x2009;years Herring C. Group 2 included patients&#x2009;&gt;8&#x2009;years Herring B and B/C, where surgical treatment demonstrated benefits in the literature. Group 3 comprised patients aged 6&#x2013;8&#x2009;years, representing a clinical &#x201C;grey zone&#x201D; in the literature. The end point was determined by the modified Stulberg Classification. Fisher&#x2019;s exact test was used to analyze the relationships between final outcomes and other variables.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> In group 1 (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;199; 74 surgical, 125 nonsurgical patients), a significant difference favoring nonsurgical treatments was observed (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001). In group 2 (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;22; 16 surgical, 6 nonsurgical patients), contrary to earlier findings, surgery did not appear to enhance outcomes, with no statistically significant difference between the treatment options (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.223). In group 3 (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;88; 55 surgical, 33 nonsurgical patients), both treatment modalities yielded similar outcomes, with no notable difference observed (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.238).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our findings align with prior research, underscoring the superiority of conservative treatment over surgery for patients&#x2009;younger than 6&#x2009;years with Herring B, B/C, and C hips, as well as those&#x2009;&gt;8&#x2009;years with type C hips. Surprisingly, patients&#x2009;older than&#x2009;8&#x2009;years with Herring B and B/C hips exhibited similar outcomes regardless of the treatment approach, advocating for a more conservative stance. Conversely, surgery did not yield significant benefits in the 6- to 8-year age group.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Our study suggests that, given the unpredictable nature of LCP disease, irrespective of age or classification, a conservative treatment strategy is warranted. Surgery should be reserved as a salvage option for specific cases presenting with limited range of motion or excessive femoral extrusion.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> It is well known that long-term result of Perthes disease relies on femoral head sphericity and articular congruency. However, we cannot influence femoral head sphericity once fragmentation phase has occurred. The aim of the study is to find some other radiological parameters that influence the functional outcome of the hip in the adulthood.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Observational, ambispective, and multicenter study of patients with Perthes disease in childhood who are currently over 18&#x2009;years of age. Latest pelvis radiographs were analyzed: joint sphericity and articular congruence (Stulberg classification), T&#xF6;nnis grade of OA, length of the femoral neck (LFN), articulo-throcanteric distance (ATD), epiphyseal extrusion index (EEI), Sharp angle, and neck-shaft angle (NSA). Patients were asked to complete the Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS), Oxford Hip Score (OHS), modified Harris Hip Score (mHHS), UCLA Activity Level, and 12-Item Short Form Survey (SF-12) questionnaires.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 141 adults (154 hips) were included. Mean age at diagnosis 6.7&#x2009;years (3.1&#x2013;11). Mean age at the time of the study was 31.6&#x2009;years (19&#x2013;71). Mean follow-up duration was 22.1&#x2009;years (10%&#x2013;68%). Eighty-two percent of patients received any kind of treatment during childhood, either conservative (36%) or surgical (46%). Stulberg classification (latest x-ray) was grade I (12%), grade II (18%), grade III (32.5%), grade IV (28%), and grade V (10.5%). Sixty percent of patients showed radiological signs of OA (T&#xF6;nnis grade I in 34%). As expected, PROM results at the latest follow-up were better for Stulberg I&#x2013;II (compared to grades III&#x2013;IV; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05) and for T&#xF6;nnis grades 0&#x2013;I (compared to grades II&#x2013;III; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). Multiple regression analysis showed that PROMs worsened with a higher femoral neck shortening (according to LFN), greater trochanter overgrowth (lower ATD), and higher femoral head extrusion (higher EEI). These three parameters (R2 values) were responsible for up to a third of the variability in the PROMs results in adulthood. We obtained regression equations that, using these three parameters in the phase of sequelae, allow us to predict the PROMs results in adulthood.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In addition to femoral head sphericity and joint congruency, we found that shortening of the femoral neck, overgrowth of the greater trochanter, and extrusion of the femoral head correlate with worse results in adulthood (hip function, sports level, and quality of life).</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Using these three radiological parameters in the phase of sequelae, we can predict the PROMS results in adulthood and, according to that, change the fate of the hip (Figure 1).</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> One of the most popular containment procedures for Legg-Calve-Perthes disease is proximal femur varus osteotomy (PFO). While favorable results have been reported with this procedure, PFO can also cause limb length discrepancy, abductor weakness, and (of most concern for families) a persistent limp. While many studies have focused on radiographic outcomes following containment surgery, none have analyzed the factors that may predict this persistent limp. The primary aim of this study was to determine clinical, radiographic, and surgical risk factors for persistent limp 2&#x2009;years after PFO.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective review of a prospectively collected multicenter database was conducted for all patients aged 6&#x2013;11&#x2009;years with early-stage LCPD (Waldenstrom I) who underwent early PFO. Clinical data from initial and follow-up visits (including presence/severity of limp) were obtained from standardized database forms; surgical data were extracted from intraoperative questionnaires. Preoperative and follow-up radiographs were used to measure traditional morphologic hip measures such as acetabular index (AI), lateral center-edge angle (LCEA), and femoral neck-shaft angle (NSA). Univariate analysis as well as multivariate logistic regression models were used to analyze what factors were associated with limp at the 2-year postoperative visit.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 95 patients (91% male) with a mean age of 8.2&#x2009;years at the time of PFO met inclusion criteria. Fifty patients (53%) underwent concomitant greater trochanter apophysiodesis (GTA). At the 2-year visit, there were 57 patients with no limp and 38 patients with a mild or severe limp. Multivariate logistic regression revealed no significant radiographic factors associated with a persistent limp. However, lower body mass index (BMI) and undergoing concurrent GTA were associated with lower rates of persistent limp across all age groups (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). When stratifying by age, apophysiodesis appeared to be most protective against any severity of limp in patients aged 6&#x2013;8&#x2009;years (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.03).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Persistent limp following otherwise successful PFO is a frustrating problem that was seen in 40% of patients at 2 years. This study suggests that higher BMI may increase the risk of developing a persistent limp. However, performing a greater trochanter apophysiodesis, particularly in patients younger than 8&#x2009;years, can be protective.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Persistent limp following proximal femur varus osteotomy is a common issue facing both surgeons and families. Ensuring a healthy BMI and considering concomitant GTA in younger patients may be a strategy to mitigate this frustrating issue.</p>

</p>
        <p>LOE-Therapeutic-Level III</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> There is a shortage of scientific studies reporting conservative treatment and shelf acetabuloplasty&#x2019;s long-term results in managing Legg-Calve-Perthes disease (LCPD). This study aims (1) to compare mid- to long-term clinical and radiographic results of children with Herring&#x2019;s lateral column group B and above, treated with either conservative or shelf acetabuloplasty for LCPD, and (2) to compare these children&#x2019;s isokinetic strength of hip muscles to those obtained from healthy volunteers.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Children diagnosed with Herring lateral column group B and above LCP treated with conservative or Shelf acetabuloplasty at a single center were retrospectively studied. Thirty-six children (36 hips; 32 males) with at least 5&#x2009;years of follow-up were included and divided into two groups: conservative group (17 children; mean age at the final follow-up&#x2009;=&#x2009;15.1&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;2&#x2009;years; mean follow-up&#x2009;=&#x2009;5.7&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1.75&#x2009;years) and shelf group (19 children; mean age at the final follow-up&#x2009;=&#x2009;16.2&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;2.7&#x2009;years; mean follow-up&#x2009;=&#x2009;6.8&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1.57&#x2009;years). A control group of 11 healthy volunteer children (mean age&#x2009;=&#x2009;14.6&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1.13&#x2009;years) engaged in ballet and followed up by the sports medicine department was also established. The presence of poor prognostic indicators (lateralization of the femoral head, beak sign, and crescent sign) was noted on initial radiographs. The Harris Hip Score (HHS) was recorded. At the final follow-up, the isokinetic strength of both hip muscles of all included children was measured using the Cybex 350 isokinetic dynamometer.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> There was no significant difference between the Shelf and conservative groups regarding poor prognostic indicators and femoral head deformities (p&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.05). HHS scores were better in the shelf group (mean&#x2009;=&#x2009;73.8&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;11.3) compared to the conservative group (mean&#x2009;=&#x2009;58.7&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;9.5) (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01). Extension, abduction, and adduction peak torque values were significantly higher in the shelf group than in the conservative group (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). While there was no significant difference between the peak torque values of the healthy group and the shelf group for flexion, extension, abduction, and adduction (p&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.05), the peak torque values of the healthy group were higher than those of the conservative group (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In children with Herring lateral column group B and above LCP, shelf acetabuloplasty may result in better functional outcomes and improved isokinetic hip muscle strengths in the mid- to long-term than conservative treatment. The Shelf procedure may achieve isokinetic hip strength like healthy children&#x2019;s.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Shelf acetabuloplasty is a valid treatment option for the management of children with Herring lateral column group B and above LCP.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Management of adolescent patients with pain and dysfunction due to residual hip deformity from Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease (LCPD) remains a treatment challenge. Recently, hip preservation procedures via surgical hip dislocation (SHD) have been offered to address intra- and extra-articular pathologies. While few studies have shown good short-term outcomes, there is a lack of quantitative data on how this treatment approach affects gait and function. The purpose of this study was to determine the gait parameters, patient-reported outcomes, and radiographic outcome of adolescent patients with LCPD who had hip preservation procedures via SHD.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective review of a prospectively collected single-center hip database was conducted for adolescent patients in the healed stage who had hip preservation procedures through SHD (Table 1). All patients underwent instrumented motion analysis using a VICON motion-capture system at preop and postop. Patients also completed the modified Harris Hip Score (mHHS-max 89) and the UCLA activity score. Stulberg classification was performed by two graders (ICC&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.73, 95% CI: 0.56&#x2013;0.83, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001). Similarly aged healthy controls (mean age 17.0&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;2.8&#x2009;years.) were used for comparison of gait parameters. Statistical analysis included Wilcoxon Signed Rank test with significance at p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Forty-two patients met inclusion criteria with mean age at surgery of 16.5&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;2.5&#x2009;years and mean duration of follow-up of 2.0&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;0.6&#x2009;years with a minimum 1-year follow-up. There was a statistically significant improvement in the mHHS-89 (preop 59.0&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;13.0, postop 71.7&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;11.9, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0001) and the UCLA activity score (preop 6.5&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;2.6, postop 8.4&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;2.1, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001) after surgery. Gait analysis revealed statistically significant improvement in the Gait Deviation Index (preop 79.80&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;12.70, postop 83.90&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;11.80, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.048), a score that captures the average deviation in kinematic components of gait from our control. There was also statistically significant improvement in gait speed (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01), power generated during hip flexion at foot pull-off (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01), and maximum degree of hip extension in the stance phase (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01). No significant difference in hip abduction moment impulse was observed (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.61). Radiographic improvement was observed in 7/42 hips, improving from Stulberg IV to Stulberg III.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Hip preservation procedures via SHD provided significant improvement in gait parameters and patient-reported outcomes at short-term follow-up.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This study provides new insight into how hip preservation procedures via SHD improve gait and function.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> The traditional piglet model of Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease (LCPD) has advanced our understanding of the pathogenesis and treatment of LCPD. However, the traditional model is highly invasive and is restricted to inducing complete (100%) femoral head ischemia. The purpose of this study is to develop a minimally invasive piglet model that can induce a range of femoral head ischemia to replicate the spectrum of LCPD disease severity and subsequent repair seen in children.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> The vascular supply to each femoral head of eight piglets (4&#x2013;10&#x2009;weeks old) was separately embolized using angiographic guidance (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;16 femoral heads total). Arteries that resembled the medial and lateral circumflex arteries in children were either both or singly cannulated and occluded using embolic particles or liquid embolic agent until complete stasis of blood flow to the femoral head for five heartbeats was achieved. The extent of ischemia was quantified in vivo using contrast-enhanced (CE) MRI immediately after embolization and again at 7&#x2009;days after embolization. Piglets were then euthanized after the final MRI, and the femoral heads were harvested for histological evaluation.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Using an iterative approach to enhance our embolization protocol, selective deposition of embolic particles within the vascular supply of the piglet femoral head resulted in acute ischemia involving approximately 50% of the femoral head as demonstrated by CE-MRI conducted immediately postoperatively (Figure 1A). Postmortem histological assessment conducted 7&#x2009;days after the embolization procedure confirmed the presence of corresponding focal avascular necrosis (Figure 1B), as well as early signs of fibrovascular repair.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our proof-of-principle study in eight piglets demonstrated the feasibility of a minimally invasive embolization procedure to induce partial ischemia of the femoral head in piglets. The histological changes closely match those reported in biopsies of children with LCPD, highlighting the potential for this model.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Heterogeneity of disease severity is one of the many challenges in managing LCPD. Treatment decisions and outcomes often relate to the severity of femoral head involvement. Our minimally invasive piglet model of LCPD can induce partial ischemia of the femoral head and has the capacity to be modifiable, inducing a range of severity. By using intravascular embolization techniques, this model may enable further understanding of the spectrum of injury and repair seen in children with LCPD.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Predicting prognosis for Perthes patients at presentation is challenging. The lateral pillar classification system helps guide prediction of outcomes and choice of treatment. However, this can only be applied at mid-fragmentation. This means a treatment window may have passed before prognosis can be established. Contrast-enhanced MRI enables earlier diagnosis. In this article, we perform morphometric analyses of the femoral head from contrast MRI. We identify multiple novel tissue types segmented in various Modified Waldenstr&#xF6;m stages. We believe this has potential to become an early prognostic model to help guide treatment.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Contrast-enhanced MRIs from 21 patients with unilateral Perthes disease were obtained. Modified Waldenstr&#xF6;m classification was performed on radiographs from within 6&#x2009;weeks of the MRI scan. Bone, cartilage (epiphyseal and physeal) and malperfused regions were segmented in 3D from both hips of each patient. Morphometric analyses revealed missing regions in all hips, with two different signal types differentiating between two novel tissue types. These are hypothesized as growing bone (observed in both epiphyseal and physeal regions) and as necrotic/fibrotic tissue (observed only in the Perthes hips). Volumes of seven tissue types (bone, epiphyseal and physeal cartilage, malperfusion, epiphyseal and physeal &#x201C;growing bone,&#x201D; and &#x201C;necrotic/fibrotic&#x201D;) were correlated against the modified Waldenstr&#xF6;m stage.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Overall bone volume and malperfusion volume decreased with advancing Waldenstr&#xF6;m stage, while epiphyseal cartilage volume increased. Physeal cartilage volume appeared unaffected by disease course. However, the volume and location of the two novel tissue types varied substantially between patients at the same stage, with some patients having three times as much growing bone as others, and other patients having twice as much necrotic/fibrotic tissue as others.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> We have identified two novel tissue types in the Perthes disease. We hypothesize these to be bone-forming and fibrotic/necrotic tissues. The variation in volume and location of each of these tissue types could account for the variability in disease course, that is, a high volume of necrotic tissue in a structural area may have a worse prognosis compared to new bone formation in the same area.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Three-dimensional morphometric analysis of contrast-enhanced MRIs could hold the key to early predictive prognostic modeling to guide treatment in Perthes Disease. Further work is needed to link these novel tissue types and distribution with outcome.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Vitamin D plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including bone metabolism. In this study, we explore the relationship between vitamin D levels and fractures in children who experienced skeletal injuries. Maintaining adequate vitamin D levels is essential for calcium and phosphorus homeostasis, which is vital for bone health and osteogenesis. While the recommended serum level of 25-hydroxy-vitamin D for adults is 30&#x2009;ng/mL, a range of 40&#x2013;70&#x2009;ng/mL is recommended for optimal health benefits in children. Vitamin D deficiency is a global concern, impacting a significant portion of the population. It is associated with a variety of conditions, including increased fracture risk.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> This prospective study was conducted between 2018 and 2020 at a pediatric hospital. It included 688 children who had sustained fractures of the upper and lower limbs. These children were divided into two groups: a study group that received vitamin D and calcium supplements for 6 months and a control group without supplementation. Another reference cohort consisting of 889 pediatric patients without a history of fractures was also included for age and sex matching. Vitamin D and calcium levels were measured in all participants.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> The study found that higher vitamin D levels were associated with a reduced risk of fractures. For each one-unit increase in vitamin D level, the chance of having a middle-third forearm fracture decreased by 7%. Similarly, the incidence of distal third forearm fractures decreased by 1.03 times for each unit increase in vitamin D level. Female gender and increasing age were also identified as risk factors for specific types of fractures. Patients in the study group exhibited improved bony callus formation during the healing process.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This study highlights the importance of monitoring serum levels of 25-OH-vitamin D in pediatric patients with low-energy trauma fractures. Supplementing with vitamin D and calcium during childhood can contribute to the development of healthy bones and may reduce the risk of fractures. The preliminary results suggest that maintaining vitamin D levels around 40&#x2009;ng/mL could be a potential target for preventing fractures in children.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> The study provides valuable insights into the relationship between vitamin D levels and fracture risk in pediatric patients. It emphasizes the importance of assessing and maintaining adequate vitamin D levels in children to promote bone health and prevent fractures. Further research is needed to confirm and refine these findings, which could have significant implications for pediatric healthcare and fracture prevention strategies.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Closed reduction (CR) under conscious sedation in the emergency department (ED) is standard of care for many pediatric fractures. There is considerable emphasis placed on improving ED efficiency and time to reduction (TTR); however, there is a paucity of research on factors associated with TTR and implications of delays in reduction. The purpose of this study is to determine factors associated with TTR in the ED.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> This is a retrospective study of all fractures managed with CR under conscious sedation in our pediatric emergency room over a 5-year period (2017&#x2013;2022). We included patients between the ages of 5 and 18 years and excluded patients with polytrauma, open fractures, or those transferred from other facilities. Chart review was performed to collect demographic and clinical data. TTR was defined as the difference in time from presentation to the ED and start of sedation for CR. Radiographs were reviewed to assess angulation, translation, and shortening of the fractures. Descriptive, Univariate, and correlation analyses were performed.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> This study included 301 patients. The mean age of patients was 10&#x2009;years, and the study population was 69% male. The mean TTR was 199&#x2009;minutes (SD: 124&#x2009;min) in this cohort with upper-extremity fractures waiting on average 189&#x2009;minutes and lower-extremity fractures waiting on average 234&#x2009;minutes (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01). TTR varied by race with White patients waiting shorter than other racial groups (174&#x2009;min vs 214&#x2009;min, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01). TTR was also longer for Hispanic patients than for non-Hispanic patients (231&#x2009;min vs 183&#x2009;min, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01); non-English speakers compared to primary English speakers (248&#x2009;min vs 189&#x2009;min, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01); and patients with government insurance compared to private insurance (215&#x2009;min vs 186&#x2009;min, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.04) (Table 1). TTR was correlated with fractures that were shorter (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.18, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.04) and more translated (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.27, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01) at the time of presentation. There was no significant correlation with morphine equivalent units administered in the ED and TTR (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;&#x2212;0.06, p&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.05).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> There are several factors associated with TTR of pediatric fractures in the ED. Specifically, patients that are non-white, Hispanic, non-English speaking, and have lower-extremity fractures tend to wait longer for CR. Delayed reductions also correlated with more displaced fractures; however, there was no correlation between TTR and narcotic pain medication administration in the ED.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> There are several factors that may predict time to closed reduction in the emergency room. Additional emphasis is needed to address these inequities in fracture management.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> To minimize the risk of delayed infection, open fractures in both children and adults often require formal irrigation and debridement in an operative setting. Recent publications have argued for nonoperative management of type I open forearm fractures in pediatric patients. However, the current body of literature still lacks sufficiently high-powered evidence to back this recommendation. As such, we aimed to identify and compare independent risk factors and rates of infection for both nondisplaced and displaced, tibial or forearm, type 1 open fractures in children.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A national, all-payer database spanning records from 2016 to 2022 was queried to isolate pediatric patients who sustained a type I open fracture of the forearm or tibia. The cohort comprised 12,334 patients. This was divided into 4 categories by age and displacement as follows: ages 0&#x2013;10 with nondisplaced fractures (3753), ages 0&#x2013;10 with displaced fractures (402), ages 11&#x2013;18 nondisplaced (6151), and ages 11&#x2013;18 displaced (2028). Demographics were also compared between the four groups. Primary outcomes were incidence rates and independent risk factors for infection within 90&#x2009;days after fracture. Time to debridement of skin, muscle, and bone were considered secondary outcomes.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Independent infection risk factors that emerged within our result set included patients with an Elixhauser Comorbidity Index (ECI)&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;2 (odds ratio (OR) 1.22, 95% CI 1.14&#x2013;1.30, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), those aged 11&#x2013;18 years with nondisplaced fracture (OR 2.09, 95% CI 1.42&#x2013;3.11, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), those age 11&#x2013;18 with displaced fractures (OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.34&#x2013;2.47, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), and patients who underwent debridement of muscle (OR 2.49, 95% CI 1.55&#x2013;3.83, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), or debridement of bone (OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.77&#x2013;2.83, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). In patients of ages 11&#x2013;18 years, the rates of nondisplaced and displaced fractures were 3.8% and 5.3% (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), respectively.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In a large database study of pediatric type I open fractures of the forearm or tibia, an ECI&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;2, an age between 11 and 18 years with nondisplaced or displaced fracture, and operative debridement of muscle or bone were shown to be independent risk factors for infection occurring within 90&#x2009;days of injury. The need for operative debridement may be minimized in patients of ages 0&#x2013;10 years with nondisplaced fractures, as these were associated with lower infection rates.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> These findings can serve as a foundation for higher-powered studies investigating the nonoperative treatment of open type I pediatric fractures.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> The standard treatment of Gartland type IIB supracondylar fractures is closed reduction and pin fixation. Blount&#x2019;s treatment method (closed reduction and immobilization in a collar-and-cuff sling) is advocated in minimally or nondisplaced fractures. We did a retrospective study comparing the outcomes of patients with type IIB fractures treated either by Blount&#x2019;s method in the emergency room or by closed reduction and pin fixation under general anesthesia. We hypothesized that Blount&#x2019;s method gives similar outcomes to pin fixation.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Altogether 232 patients with a Gartland type IIB supracondylar fractures were identified from the institutional fracture treatment device (KIDS Fracture Tool) between 2014 and 2022. Of these, 42 were treated by Blount&#x2019;s method and 185 by closed reduction and pin fixation. All patients treated by collar-and-cuff and 35 pin fixation&#x2013;treated age-matched patients were invited to a follow-up visit at mean 4&#x2009;years (range 1.6&#x2013;8.0) from treatment. The outcome was assessed using Flynn&#x2019;s criteria (functional: loss of range-of-motion (ROM) cosmetic: loss of carrying angle), grip strength, elbow ROM, QuickDASH, and any treatment complications.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Forty collar-and-cuff&#x2013;treated and 35 pin fixation&#x2013;treated patients agreed to participate. According to Flynn&#x2019;s criteria, the functional result was satisfactory for all patients in both groups; the cosmetic in all pin-treaded and in 38/40 of the collar-and-cuff treated. No difference was found between the collar-and-cuff and pin fixation treated (p&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.05) in grip strength, ROM, QuickDASH (mean 0.7 and 0.2), or the QuickDASH hobby score (mean 0.2 for both). Two patients had mild sensory dysfunction after pin fixation.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Blount&#x2019;s method yields similar results to closed reduction and pin fixation in Gartland type IIB supracondylar fractures.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> The Blount method offers an easily accessible treatment option for Gartland type IIB supracondylar fractures.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Supracondylar humerus (SCH) fractures are common and present with associated nerve injuries in 6%&#x2013;16% of cases. Historically, SCH fractures with nerve injuries have warranted urgent surgical treatment. Recent studies have shown no evidence that urgent treatment is needed in patients with anterior interosseous nerve (AIN) palsy nor in patients with a pulseless hand and median nerve palsy. Although indications for urgent treatment are loosening, no studies have evaluated the need for urgent surgical treatment in SCH fractures with any form of isolated nerve injury.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective review of 103 patients with surgically managed SCH fractures and concomitant neurologic deficit on presentation was conducted at a single level 1 pediatric trauma hospital from 1997 to 2022. Information on presenting neurologic injury, time from injury to surgery, surgical intervention, and neurologic outcome was recorded. Exclusion criteria included concomitant vascular injury, ipsilateral forearm/wrist fracture, inadequate documentation, open fracture, unknown time of initial injury, pre-existing neurologic deficit, and compartment syndrome.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Sixty-seven patients with an average age of 7&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;2&#x2009;years and average time to surgery of 10&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;6 hours were included. Fractures were Gartland Type II (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;3 (4%)), Type III (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;57 (85%)), Type IV (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;3 (4%)), and flexion type (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;4 (6%)). Sixty-five patients (97%) were followed up to partial neurologic recovery, and 39 (58%) were followed up to full neurologic recovery. Neurologic deficit included median (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;41 (61%)), radial (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;24 (36%)), and ulnar (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;17 (25%)) nerves. Ten patients (15%) had isolated AIN injury without sensory deficits. Average time to partial neurologic recovery was 21&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;24&#x2009;days, and time to full recovery was 100&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;92&#x2009;days. There was a statistically significant relationship between time to partial neurologic recovery and time to surgical intervention (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.004), but no relationship between time to full neurologic recovery and time to surgery (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.3). Of patients not lost to follow-up, there were no permanent neurologic deficits.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Shorter time to fixation of pediatric SCH fractures with isolated nerve injury was associated with slightly earlier partial recovery but not full neurologic recovery. Prioritizing urgent surgery in these patients does not improve their ultimate neurologic recovery.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Prioritizing urgent surgery in patients with supracondylar humerus fractures and associated nerve injuries does not improve their ultimate neurologic recovery. Delaying surgery until the proper staff and operating conditions are available will not negatively impact long-term neurologic recovery.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> A recent upward trend in operative management is noted for medial epicondyle fractures; however, data from a large prospective multicenter cohort are still sparse. Our study aims to report on baseline characteristics among the operatively treated medial epicondyle fractures in a large cohort from the MEMO (Medial Epicondyle Multicenter Outcomes) prospective observational study cohort.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Patients aged 8 to 18&#x2009;years who underwent open reduction and internal fixation of medial epicondyle fracture with displacement&#x2009;&#x2265;3&#x2009;mm were identified from the operative arm of the prospective multicenter database established by the MEMO study group from 10 large pediatric hospitals in the US/Canada. Patients excluded were those with open fractures, pathological fractures, previous history of fractures, or old fractures (&gt;6&#x2009;weeks from injury). Demographic, injury, and surgical characteristics were recorded. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 186 patients were included with a mean age of 12.8&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;2.1&#x2009;years. Among the cohort, 56.8% of patients were males while 43.2% were females. All physes were open at the elbow in 35% of patients. Only 8.2% of fractures were associated with a dislocation, and 3.8% had an ulnar nerve deficit. Single large fragment was the most common pattern (89.5%) followed by an avulsion of only a small component (6.1%) and comminuted fracture (1.7%). Fractures commonly occurred in isolation (76.3%) while associated injuries noted were lateral epicondyle (2.7%) and radial head/neck fracture (1.6%; Table 1). Mean displacement on radiographs and CT scans was 11.4&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;4.8&#x2009;mm and 10.9&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;4.2&#x2009;mm, respectively. Complete displacement (&gt;100%) was seen in a majority of cases by both radiographs (35.4%) and CT scans (44.4%). Fixation was preferred in the supine position (45.7%) and performed most using a headed screw&#x2009;+&#x2009;washer (76.3%), followed by a headed screw (14.5%). Only a small percentage was secured with a suture anchor (3.8%). Additional fixation was commonly achieved using suture reinforcement (27.3%) while the most common additional repair needed was flexor pronator repair (9.7%). Long arm cast was the preferred postoperative immobilization method (55.4%) followed by splint (37.1%) and brace (6.4%; Table 2).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Medial epicondyle fractures commonly occur in isolation during with a low incidence of ulnar nerve injury. Fixation is commonly in the supine position using a screw&#x2009;+&#x2009;washer and immobilized in a cast postoperatively.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Our study presents the current operative trends of medial epicondyle fractures in a large cohort further allowing for evaluation of optimal treatment methods and associated patient-reported outcomes.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Previous studies of tibial spine fracture (TSF) repair have favored suture over screw fixation in adult cadaveric and porcine bone. However, a recent study found that screws and sutures were biomechanically comparable in human pediatric cadavers, with relatively low fixation strength. Optimal fixation strength may facilitate early motion, to reduce the rate of arthrofibrosis, the most common complication. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the hypothesis that TSF fixation with sutures attached to anchors placed in stronger meta-diaphyseal bone would be biomechanically superior.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Meyers-Mckeever type III TSFs were created in pediatric knees. In the prior study, specimens were randomly assigned to two fixation groups: two screws or two sutures. The screw fixation group used two 4.0-mm screws. The suture group used two high-strength sutures passed through the TSF fragment and ACL. These sutures were then passed through proximal tibia tunnels and tied over a bony bridge. In the current study, two sutures were similarly passed but were instead anchored to two 2.8-mm suture anchors placed three physis heights distal to the tibial plateau. Fixation biomechanics were assessed with cyclic loading and load-to-failure protocols. Ultimate failure load in newtons was recorded.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Eighteen pediatric cadaveric knees were analyzed: twelve from the prior study and six in the new study&#x2019;s suture plus suture anchor group. The screw and suture repair groups had identical mean (8.30&#x2009;years) and median (8.50&#x2009;years) ages, while the suture plus suture anchor group had a mean and median age of 9.33 and 9.00&#x2009;years, respectively. The suture plus suture anchor group (mean: 224.00&#x2009;N) showed higher ultimate failure loads than screw (mean: 143.52&#x2009;N) (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01) and suture (mean: 135.35&#x2009;N) (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.009) groups. Screw and suture fixation did not significantly differ (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.7597). Screw constructs failed by pulling out of tibial spongy bone, suture constructs failed by cheese wiring through the metaphyseal bridge, and suture plus suture anchor constructs failed through the ACL-tibial spine avulsion fragment complex.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Screw and suture fixation for type III TSFs in pediatric cadaveric knees had comparable strength. Despite the slight age differences between fixation groups and the time-zero nature of the biomechanical testing, this study found that TSFs repaired with sutures anchored in meta-diaphyseal cortex provided significantly stronger fixation.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This study presents a biomechanically superior fixation for TSF repair. Greater fixation strength may facilitate early motion and reduce the risk of arthrofibrosis, the primary complication of this condition.</p>

        <p>LOE-Diagnostic-Level II</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Tibial tubercle avulsion fractures (TTAF) are uncommon injuries, comprising less than 3% of all proximal tibial fractures. Rarely, these fractures occur in conjunction with patellar tendon tears (PTTs). We aimed to identify risk factors associated with a combined TTAF and PTT.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective review of patients presenting to a single, tertiary children&#x2019;s hospital with TTAF between 2010 and 2022 was performed. Demographic data, operative details, radiographs, and injury patterns were analyzed. Radiographs were assessed for epiphyseal union stage (EUS), Ogden classification, and fracture patterns. Patients with isolated TTAF, TTAF with complete PTT (CPTT), or TTAF with partial PTT (PPTT) were identified. Fracture fragment rotation was defined as rotation along the fragment&#x2019;s short axis on lateral x-ray projection. Patients with incomplete follow-up were excluded from analysis. Multinomial logistic regression models were used to assess the impact of comminution, rotation, EUS, bilateral injury, and Ogden Classification on the injury type.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> One hundred ninety-eight TTAFs were identified in 186 patients (mean age: 13.90&#x2009;years). One hundred seventy-three (87%) were isolated TTAF, 15 (8%) were TTAF with CPTT, and 10 (5%) were TTAF with PPTT. There were no significant differences in demographics and clinical variables between groups. Ogden I Classification distribution differed between isolated TTAF and TTAF with PPTT (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0059) and isolated TTAF and TTF with CPTT (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). In univariate analysis, fragment rotation (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) was associated with both PPTT and CPTT, comminution was associated with CPTT (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01), and Ogden I Classification was associated with PPTT (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0023). Multinomial regression showed patients with fragment rotation had 17.55 times higher odds of CPTT (95% CI 2.97&#x2013;136.66) and 18.38 times higher odds of PPTT (95% CI 3.16&#x2013;119.09). Lower EUS was associated with increased likelihood of CPTT (OR 2.51, 95% CI 1.13&#x2013;6.22) but not PPTT. Ogden I Classification had 12.71 times greater odds of CPTT (95% CI 3.25&#x2013;625) and 2.32 times greater odds of PPTT (95% CI 1.15&#x2013;5.21).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Ogden Classification and fragment rotation are the most distinguishing features between isolated TTAF and TTAF with CPTT or PPTT. Skeletal immaturity, measured by EUS, is associated with TTAF with CPTT.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This is the first study to identify risk factors for TTAF combined with PTT. Surgeons may use this information to aid in preoperative planning.</p>

        <p>LOE-Prognostic-Level III</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the clinical and radiological outcomes of children treated surgically for McFarland (MF) fracture and assess potential risk factors for premature physeal closure (PPC).</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> We retrospectively reviewed 48 children with a mean age of 11.2&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;3.2&#x2009;years (range, 2&#x2013;14) who underwent surgical treatment for MF fracture. Demographic data were retrieved from the charts, including age at the time of injury, mechanism of injury, initial displacement, fracture type, time from injury to surgery, reduction method, fixation method, time of hardware removal, and whether or not the patient developed PPC. The patients were followed radiographically and clinically on a regular basis for 38.9&#x2009;months (range, 15&#x2013;89).</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> PPC occurred in 35.4% (17/48) of patients. Our analysis revealed that patients with PPC were significantly younger (9.2&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;3.5&#x2009;years) than those without PPC (12.2&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;2.6&#x2009;years) (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Furthermore, age and initial displacement were identified as independent risk factors for PPC. Notably, an age of less than 11.5&#x2009;years and an initial displacement of more than 4.5&#x2009;mm represented the cutoff points for an increased incidence of PPC. In addition, patients younger than 11.5&#x2009;years had a substantially higher rate of PPC (65%) than those aged 11.5&#x2009;years or older (14.3%) (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Likewise, patients with initial displacement under 4.5&#x2009;mm showed a significantly lower rate of PPC (10.5%) than those with initial displacement over 4.5&#x2009;mm (78.9%) (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.009). Overall, 11/48 patients had limited ankle ROM (mean: 73.3&#xB0;&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;4.4&#xB0;; range: 55&#xB0;&#x2013;80&#xB0;); mean ankle ROM in patients with PPC was 67.9&#xB0;&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;7.7&#xB0; (range, 55&#xB0;&#x2013;78&#xB0;), while it was 74&#xB0;&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;3.5&#xB0; (range, 65&#xB0;&#x2013;80&#xB0;) in those without PPC (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.006). Lower-limb discrepancy was 2.5&#x2009;cm in any children (mean: 0.13&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;0.27&#x2009;cm; range, 0&#x2013;2.5) although 3 patients with PPC had lower-limb discrepancy more than 2&#x2009;cm, and 5 patients with PPC complained of postoperative pain.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Age and initial displacement are independent risk factors for PPC in children with MF fracture. Specifically, children under the age of 11.5&#x2009;years and those with initial displacement exceeding 4.5&#x2009;mm have a higher risk of developing PPC.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Identifying the risk factors associated with PPC can provide valuable guidance for managing MF fracture in pediatric patients, ultimately aiding in the prevention of potential complications. This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the clinical and radiological outcomes of children treated surgically for MF fracture and assess potential risk factors for PPC.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Fractures involving the distal tibial physis (DTP) are frequent in children. When displaced, an attempt at closed reduction and casting is typically performed. Afterwards, it is unclear whether these should be placed in a short-leg cast (SLC) or a long-leg cast (LLC) as some providers have concerns that an SLC may not provide rotational stability predisposing to loss of reduction (LOR). The aim of the current study was to compare rate of LOR, patient-reported outcomes, and the risk of premature physeal closure in DTP fractures treated with an SLC compared to LLC.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Patients with DTP fractures were prospectively enrolled. Prior to the start of the study, providers indicated their preferred cast length and prescribed either a SLC or LLC based on their stated preference. Subjects were included for analysis if they had a minimum follow-up to fracture healing. Cast type, LOR, pain, and satisfaction were recorded. The Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM) was recorded after 3&#x2009;months of follow-up. Continuous data were evaluated with either ANOVA or the Mann&#x2013;Whitney U. Categorical data were evaluated with Fisher&#x2019;s exact test.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Forty subjects (mean age 12.5&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1.9&#x2009;years and follow-up 7.3&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;5.7&#x2009;months) were included: 24 were treated with an SLC, and 16 were treated with a LLC. The groups were similar in age, prereduction displacement, and follow-up (p&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.5). No subjects had a LOR. Two subjects in the SLC group and one in the LLC group required a subsequent epiphysiodesis (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.0). Pain (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.197) and satisfaction with treatment (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.255) were similar at the 1-week visit. Pain was greater at the 4- to 8-week visit in the LLC group (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.033). Satisfaction at the 4- to 8-week visit and final follow-up were similar among the two groups (p&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.78), as were the FAAM activities of daily living (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.154) and FAAM sport (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.227) scores.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Patients with DTP fractures treated with a closed reduction and application of an SLC had high rates of satisfaction and no cases of LOR and can be safely used as an alternative to LLC. Families do need to be followed for a minimum of 6&#x2009;months as premature physeal closure remains a possibility despite casting type.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Contrary to the teaching of many pediatric orthopedic textbooks, patients with distal tibia physeal fractures requiring closed reduction can be treated safely with a short leg cast with low risk for loss of reduction.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Distal tibial physeal fractures are one of the most common growth plate injuries, second only to distal radial physeal fractures. Acceptable reduction parameters have yet to be thoroughly defined when considering residual angulation. Current literature can be found in opposition when evaluating the likelihood of remodeling of a remaining angular deformity in extra-articular distal tibial physeal fractures.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective review was performed of a multisite cohort of patients having undergone attempted closed reduction and casting of a displaced extra-articular distal tibial physeal fracture. Patients with persistent displacement in the sagittal and/or coronal plane at the time of healing were evaluated. The amount of angulation at the time of final cast removal was compared to the alignment at final radiographic follow-up to determine amount of remodeling. Alignment was identified by evaluating the lateral distal tibial angle (LDTA) and anterior distal tibial angle (ADTA). These values were compared to establish normal values.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 137 patients were identified as having persistent angulation in either the lateral and/or AP radiograph at the time of final cast removal. A sagittal plane malalignment was found in 135 patients while 44 subjects demonstrated coronal plane malalignment. Of those with persistent sagittal plane angulation, only 6% were found to have had remodeling sufficient to be within the normal range at final radiographic follow-up. In addition, 76% of patients were found to have persistent angulation of 4&#x2009;degrees or more. In comparison, coronal plane malalignment was found to have remodeled to a normal value in 39% of patients, with another 41% having less than 3&#x2009;degrees of residual deformity.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Evidence is lacking demonstrating the capability of distal tibial remodeling after a physeal fracture with historic literature in opposition. These findings suggest that coronal plane angulation commonly remodels to normal values. Comparatively, sagittal plane malalignment is most commonly remains uncorrected at final follow-up evaluation.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> While the distal tibial physis possesses some ability for coronal plane remodeling after fracture, sagittal abnormalities rarely return to normal values. Further studies are required to determine acceptable limits of displacement that would be anticipated to produce good patient outcomes.</p>

        <p>LOE-Therapeutic-Level III</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Our aim was to review a cohort of pediatric ankle fracture patients who had experienced posttraumatic growth disturbances to assess both the process of identifying and responding to the growth disturbances.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A search of our computerized radiographic imaging system from 2001 through 2020 identified 61 patients who demonstrated growth disturbance following their unilateral pediatric ankle fractures. Data collected included demographic and injury-related data as well as details of how and when growth disturbance was identified and responded to. Fracture patterns were classified according to the Dias-Tachdjian system. Patients with post-injury follow-up that included both identification of and response to a growth disturbance were included in the study.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Twenty-seven PER injuries, 15 SPF injuries, 11 SI injuries, and 8 SER injuries made up the fracture patterns observed in the study. The average follow-up period was 30.8&#x2009;months. Forty three of the sixty-one (70%) emergency department closed reductions went on to have physeal arrest. Physeal gapping was noted in most of those cases (26/43; 60%) on postreduction imaging. We report a premature physeal closure rate of 40% (17/43) in patients who underwent anatomic closed reduction in the emergency department. Similar rates of physeal arrest were observed in patients initially treated nonoperatively (31/61; 51%) and those who were treated surgically (30/61; 49%). A total of seven patients underwent opening wedge osteotomy of the distal tibia to correct angular deformity. Of that subset of patients, three of seven (43%) had inconsistent follow-up. The average time for a physician to have concern or note a physeal arrest on imaging was 8&#x2009;months. Thirty five of 61 cases were treated nonoperatively.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Physeal growth arrest remains a significant concern after pediatric ankle fractures, especially PER type injuries. PER injuries were more likely to have a growth arrest than other injury types. There remains a high risk for growth disturbance despite anatomic emergency department closed reductions. No trend was observed with respect to initial management and physeal arrest.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> The ankle fracture pattern should be taken into consideration when discussing management and the possibility for future growth disturbance with the patient and family. The physician as well as the patient and their family should be mindful of the importance of close, consistent follow-up as arrests can be noted within 1 year of injury. Despite this risk, the majority of physeal arrests may only require monitoring.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Bone tissue is a biphasic composite material comprising a collagen matrix and an inorganic hydroxyapatite (HA) phase, which confers mechanical toughness and stiffness, respectively. Long collagen fibrils are created by interconnecting collagen molecules with crosslinks, which subsequently become mineralized. Bone in osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) has reduced quantity or impaired quality due to a genetic disorder that affects type I collagen formation and subsequent mineralization. Understanding the molecular mechanisms behind collagen synthesis, folding, assembly, and its related mineralization process is critical in developing new effective therapies for OI. This research focusses on alterations in collagen formation and mineralization in OI bone.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Surgical waste material was collected over a period of 20 years from children who underwent orthopedic surgery for OI. Only specimens originating from long bones of the lower extremities were included. All OI patients had bisphosphonate treatment. Waste material from children of the same age who had bone surgery was used as control. The samples were cleaved, dissolved, and analyzed using reversed-phase chromatography with a Waters 2795 Separations module and a Waters 2475 HPLC Multi Fluorescence detector. The study used an HPLC column packed with C18-coated silica particles (Tosoh TSKgel ODS-80-TM) for the measurement of hydroxylysine (Hyl) and hydroxyproline (Hyp) to measure the amount of collagen calculating 300 Hyp residues per collagen molecule. The pyridinoline crosslinks hydroxylysylpyridinoline (HP) and lysylpyridinoline (LP) were measured by ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) with an ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 column. The data analysis was performed with Waters Empower 3 Chromatography Data Software.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Compared to normal bone, OI bone showed a significant decrease in Hyp residues (collagen content) per milligram dry bone. Hyl levels were significantly elevated in OI bone. HP and, to some extent, LP levels were also elevated, and HP/LP ratios were significantly higher in OI bone.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our study revealed hyper-hydroxylation of type I collagen Lys residues in bone tissue from OI patients as indicated by increased Hyl levels, HP crosslinks levels, and higher HP/LP crosslink ratios. Hyperhydroxylation of collagen lysine causes steric hindrance and thus wider spacing between the collagen molecules in the collagen fibrils. This wider spacing and the decrease in collagen content per mg OI bone explains higher mineralization of per collagen fibrils in bone.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> The hyperhydroxylation of collagen I is an important factor in the increased brittleness in OI. By counteracting this hyper-hydroxylation of collagen I, the mechanical properties of the OI bone matrix may be improved.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> The contribution of the proximal apophysis of the tibia to tibial growth and the anatomy around the knee have not been thoroughly examined. Knowledges are restricted to changes found after tibia apophyseal fractures in children and early adolescents, and subsequent fixations. According to case reports, the cessation of growth in the apophysis following trauma might result in a recurvatum deformity in the proximal tibia. In this study, changes around the knee were examined anatomically and radiologically in growing rats by performing apophysiodesis. Possible changes can be used in the treatment of diseases (CP, arthrogryposis, and spinal dysraphism) with knee flexion deformities.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Eighteen 10-week-old male Sprague Dawley rats were used. One was excluded due to screw malposition. Under anesthesia, a cortical microscrew (1.2 &#xD7; 7&#x2009;mm) was placed in the anteroposterior direction under the patellar ligament to the right tibial apophysis. Six weeks later, lateral radiographic images of both the right and left hind (control) legs were taken under anesthesia, and the screws were removed. Euthanasia was applied to nine randomly selected animals. The other eight animals were left alive for observation to wait for the closure of the epiphyseal lines. Tibial slope angle (TSA), femoral, tibial, and fibular, and patellar ligament lengths were first measured from radiographs, and the Insall-Salvati index value was calculated.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> TSA value was found to be 6.60&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;8.49&#x2009;degree in the operation group and 21.84&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1.58 in the control (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.000). Femoral length (mm) was 34.41&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1.08 in the operation group and 34.66&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1.06 in the control (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.011). Tibial length was 35.92&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1.24 in the operation group and 37.37&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1.01 in the control (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.000). Fibular length was 23.49&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1.07 in the operation group and 23.88&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;0.77 in the control (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.043). Patellar ligament length was 8.01&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;0.66 in the operation group and 6.88&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;0.27 in the control (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.000). The Insall-Salvati Index was 1.74&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;0.18 in the operation group and 1.52&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;0.09 in the control, and a statistical difference was observed between the groups (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.000).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In recent years, different implants have been used to treat knee deformities caused by diseases by distal anterior epiphysiodesis of the femur. In this treatment method, since the surgery is performed medially and laterally from the patella, it can risk the patellar track. In this study, it was aimed at eliminating flexion deformity with a simple surgery, like tibial apophysiodesis.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> The significant reduction of the tibial slope in rats suggests that the flexion deformity in humans can be resolved with tibial apophysiodesis.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia (CPT) is a refractory condition characterized by the decreased osteogenic ability in tibial pseudarthrosis repair. Periosteal mesenchymal stem cells (PMSCs) are multipotent cells involved in bone formation regulation.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Clinical samples from 40 individuals, including 20 congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia (CPT) patients and 20 controls, were collected with ethical approvals. Periosteal tissue was processed, and primary mesenchymal stem cells (PMSCs) were isolated. Immunophenotyping and flow cytometry validated PMSCs. ALP and AR staining assessed osteogenic differentiation. Cell viability was measured using CCK-8, and EdU assays determined DNA replication. Western blot and qRT-PCR evaluated gene expression. Luciferase reporter assays, RNase R digestion, and Actinomycin D experiments were conducted. Biotin-miR-338-3p pulldown experiments were carried out. In vivo experiments involved an OVX animal model, microCT measurements, and histological analyses.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Our results demonstrated that circ_0000888 and PTN likely enhanced the viability, proliferation, and osteogenic ability of PMSCs, while miR-338-3p had the opposite effect. Further analysis confirmed the regulatory relationship circ_0000888 suppressed the activity of miR-338-3p and upregulated the expression of its downstream target PTN by binding to miR-338-3p, consequently promoting the viability and osteogenic differentiation ability of CPTdPMSCs.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our findings unveil an unexpected link between circ_0000888/miR-338-3p/PTN in promoting osteogenic ability and indicate the potential pathogenic mechanisms of CPT.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This study delves into the intricate mechanisms underlying CPT, a challenging condition marked by impaired bone repair. It sheds light onto the pivotal roles of circ_0000888, miR-338-3p, and PTN in regulating PMSCs and their osteogenic potential. The findings unveil a previously unknown relationship between circ_0000888, miR-338-3p, and PTN, showcasing their impact on PMSC viability and osteogenic differentiation. This research provides critical insights into the pathogenesis of CPT, potentially paving the way for novel therapeutic strategies to address the refractory nature of this condition and improve patient outcomes.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Trochlear dysplasia is the most common anatomic risk factor for patellar instability, being present in 80%&#x2013;90% of affected knees. However, correction of trochlear dysplasia by trochleoplasty is contraindicated in prepubertal children due to the risk of growth disturbances with the close relationship between the proximal trochlea and anterior aspect of distal femoral physis. The purpose of our study was to assess if guided growth can be used to deepen the trochlear groove.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> The study was approved by the IACUC committee. Eight 6-week-old New Zealand rabbits were divided into three groups. Four rabbits in group 1 formed the intervention group with a 2.4-mm transphyseal screw placed across the distal femoral physis. The screw was placed in a retrograde fashion in the center on AP view and anterior on the lateral view. For two rabbits in group 2, a similar screw was placed in a retrograde fashion but short of physis. For two rabbits in group 3, transphyseal drilling was performed, but no screw was placed. The contralateral knee acted as control knee for all rabbits. Preoperative, 3-month, and 6-month CT scans were performed for both knees for all eight rabbits. The trochlear depth, patellar height, and posterior condylar offset were calculated for preoperative and follow-up CT scans. At 6&#x2009;months, the knees were opened for a gross evaluation of the trochlear groove.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> There were no adverse events through 6&#x2009;months of follow-up. Three rabbits initially demonstrated deepening of the groove at 3&#x2009;months on CT. One of these normalized at 6&#x2009;months as the screw position changed with growth. Observationally, there was notable increased groove formation on two of the rabbits (Figure 1). Secondary changes, however, were observed in the distal femur with decreased patellar height and decreased posterior condylar offset (due to extension deformity).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The study demonstrates proof of concept that guided growth using transphyseal screws across the anterior aspect of the distal femoral physis below the trochlea can lead to trochlear deepening. Secondary changes were seen secondary to cessation of growth along the anterior distal femur. Smaller screws or a larger animal model can be used in the future to limit the secondary effects on the screw. In addition, the screw may need to be exchanged or placed bicortically to maintain its positioning in this physis.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Once the technique is optimized and validated, this may be used for management of trochlear dysplasia in the skeletally immature patient.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Mucopolysaccharidosis type I Hurler (MPSIH) is a lysosomal disorder caused by glycosaminoglycans accumulation due to deficiency of alpha-L-iduronidase, characterized by progressive skeletal dysplasia. We analyzed midterm results on hip dysplasia (HD) in MPSIH patients who received hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC)-gene therapy (GT).</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Eight MPSIH patients received HSPC-GT in a phase I/II clinical trial (NCT03488394) at 23.5&#x2009;months (range 14&#x2013;34) of median age. HD was evaluated in 16 hips using Acetabular Index (AI) and Migration Percentage (MP) on x-rays and MRIs at baseline, 12, 24, 36, and 48&#x2009;months after HSPC-GT with a median follow-up of 47&#x2009;months (range 36&#x2013;49) and a median age at last follow-up of 66&#x2009;months (range 56&#x2013;82). Cartilaginous Acetabular Index (CAI) and Cartilaginous Migration Percentage (CMP) were measured on MRIs. Hip-joint range of motion (ROM) were evaluated at the same timepoints.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> One patient was excluded from the analysis from 12&#x2009;months after HSPC-GT because of surgery for bilateral hip dislocation already present before HSPC-GT. Thereafter, 14 hips were analyzed. On x-ray, mean AI was 29&#xB0;&#xB1;&#x2009;6&#xB0; at baseline (16/16 hips), 25&#xB0;&#xB1;&#x2009;5&#xB0; at&#x2009;+12&#x2009;months after GT (8/14), 26&#xB0;&#xB1;&#x2009;5&#xB0; at&#x2009;+24&#x2009;months (10/14), 20&#xB0;&#xB1;&#x2009;6&#xB0; at&#x2009;+36&#x2009;months (12/14), and 17&#xB0;&#xB1;&#x2009;4&#xB0; at&#x2009;+48&#x2009;months (8/14), whereas mean MP was 61%&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;20% (16/16), 47%&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;8% (8/14), 41%&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;13% (10/14), 27%&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;8% (12/14), and 27%&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;10% (8/14), respectively. On MRI, mean AI was 31&#xB0;&#xB1;&#x2009;8&#xB0; at baseline (16/16), 30&#xB0;&#xB1;&#x2009;4&#xB0; at&#x2009;+12&#x2009;months (10/14), 29&#xB0;&#xB1;&#x2009;7&#xB0; at&#x2009;+24&#x2009;months (10/14), 23&#xB0;&#xB1;&#x2009;6&#xB0; at&#x2009;+36&#x2009;months (12/14), 23&#xB0;&#xB1;&#x2009;7&#xB0; at&#x2009;+48&#x2009;months (10/14); CAI was 12&#xB0;&#xB1;&#x2009;7&#xB0; (16/16), 11&#xB0;&#xB1;&#x2009;4&#xB0; (10/14), 11&#xB0;&#xB1;&#x2009;3&#xB0; (6/14), 9&#xB0;&#xB1;&#x2009;5&#xB0; (12/14), and 7&#xB0;&#xB1;&#x2009;5&#xB0; (10/14); MP was 44%&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;11% (14/16), 47%&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;10% (10/14), 36%&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;8% (10/14), 33%&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;7% (12/14), and 37%&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;12% (10/14); CMP was 26%&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;8% (14/16), 32%&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;5% (10/14), 28%&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;7% (10/14), 27%&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;9% (12/14), and 23%&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;3% (10/14), respectively. One of 14 hips showed progression of HD, not requiring surgery. Hip ROM results were always normal for abduction-adduction, internal-external rotation, and flexion while increased up to normal values in extension (10/14) at the last follow-up.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> After a median of 47&#x2009;months and at a median age of 66&#x2009;months, MPSIH patients undergoing HSPC-GT showed stabilization of HD in 13/14 hips. A longer follow-up is needed for definitive conclusions.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> HD is one of the most relevant skeletal manifestations in MPSIH for which standard of care (hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, enzyme replacement therapy) is ineffective. Our study indicates stabilization of HD early after HSPC-GT, highlighting its possible role in the treatment of MPSIH skeletal manifestations.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Clinical studies of Legg-Calv&#xE9;-Perthes disease (LCPD) have demonstrated correlation between the speed of femoral head repair and radiographic outcome. Plain radiographs are utilized to follow resorption and repair, but changes seen radiographically lag behind the physiologic process. Contrast-enhanced MRI (CE-MRI) is often used to assess severity of femoral head involvement in the early stages of LCPD. However, serial CE-MRI exams to monitor disease progression are not performed due to safety concerns of gadolinium contrast in children. In piglet model studies of LCPD, quantitative MRI techniques have been shown to be a non-contrast-enhanced alternative to detect ischemic injury to the femoral head; however, their sensitivities to detect reparative changes following the ischemic injury have not been evaluated.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Ischemic injury was induced in 7 femoral heads of 4 piglets (aged 6&#x2013;10&#x2009;weeks) using a unilateral traditional ligation model or bilateral intravascular embolization approach. Advanced 3&#x2009;T MRI sequences (3D DESS and quantitative T2, aT1&#x3C1;, and aT2&#x3C1; relaxation time maps) were acquired 7&#x2009;days after the onset of ischemia. Femoral heads were harvested for histological evaluation and stained with H&amp;E. A four-step process (Figure 1A) was used to define regions of interest (ROI) that were considered affected (necrotic, reduced cellularity, fibrovascular repair) or viable. Histological annotations were spatially coregistered to the 3D MRI images, and corresponding median relaxation times were then quantified for each of the annotated regions. The percent differences between the affected versus viable ROIs were then calculated for each femoral head.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 20 affected ROIs were identified (3 necrotic, 12 reduced cellularity, and 5 fibrovascular repair). T2, aT1&#x3C1;, and aT2&#x3C1; were all increased in the affected vs viable ROIs (Figure 1B). Comparisons among the affected ROIs identified an overall decrease in the relaxation times between regions of reduced cellularity and the fibrovascular repair.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> T2, aT1&#x3C1;, and aT2&#x3C1; relaxation times, which are known to increase following ischemic injury to the femoral head, subsequently decrease with infiltration of fibrovascular repair. This is significant since relaxation time mapping may provide a means to noninvasively assess the stages and progression of LCPD through the bone repair process.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Quantitative T2, aT1&#x3C1;, and aT2&#x3C1; relaxation time mappings are noninvasive, non-contrast-enhanced techniques that may provide alternatives to CE-MRI to detect ischemic injury and subsequent repair to the femoral head. These techniques may provide a needed window into progression of LCPD in patients to inform treatment decisions and evaluate the efficacy of treatments.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Despite developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) being the most prevalent congenital musculoskeletal disorder, its cause remains elusive. Adequate nutrient provision and coordinated electron exchange (redox) processes are critical for fetal growth and tissue development. This novel study sought to explore specific biochemical pathways in skeletal development, for potential involvement in the etiology of DDH.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Spot urine samples were collected from infants, aged 13&#x2013;61&#x2009;days, with and without DDH. Ion chromatography/mass spectrometry was used to quantify thiosulfate, sulfate, nitrate, and phosphate, while nitrite was quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography. Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were measured as markers of lipid peroxidation. Creatinine and osmolality were determined by 96-well plate assay and micro-osmometer to potentially normalize values for renal function, lean body mass and hydration status.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 97 urine samples were analyzed from 99 babies; 30 with DDH and 69 age-matched non-DDH controls. Thiosulfate, TBARS and creatinine concentrations differed between DDH and controls (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.025, 0.015, and 0.004, respectively). Urine osmolality was significantly lower in DDH than in controls (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.036), indicative of the production of a more diluted urine in DDH infants. Following adjustment for osmolality, significant differences became apparent in urinary sulfate levels in DDH (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.035), whereas all other parameters became similar between groups.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This is the first study to assess the potential role of these inorganic anions in DDH. The higher levels of sulfate found in infants with DDH suggests either enhanced intake from milk, increased endogenous formation, or impaired renal reabsorption. This investigation demonstrates the power of urine metabolomics and highlights the importance of normalization for hydration status to disentangle developmental disorders.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Our results strongly suggest that DDH is a systemic disease associated with altered uptake, formation, or handling of sulfate. There is potential for new opportunities in prevention or treatment of DDH via nutritional intervention.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), a type I collagenopathy characterized by increased bone fragility, has traditionally been considered a low bone mass disease. This study investigated the mechanism of low bone mass in the OI population and evaluated differences in bone morphology by age, sex, and bisphosphonate treatment.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> We retrospectively examined 52 hand/wrist radiographs from 28 children aged 0&#x2013;8&#x2009;years with OI (11 males, 17&#x2009;females), 77 from 36 children aged 8&#x2013;18&#x2009;years with OI (15 males, 21&#x2009;females), and 150 from 84 adults with OI (22 males, 62&#x2009;females). Second metacarpal length, robustness (total area/length), and relative cortical area (cortical area/total area) were measured. Bisphosphonate treatment&#x2009;&lt;2&#x2009;years was noted. Measurements were compared to 292 radiographs from fifty-seven 0- to 8-year-old controls (33 males, 24&#x2009;females), 346 radiographs from fifty-eight 8- to 18-year-old controls (29 males, 29&#x2009;females), and 63 radiographs from 63 adults (27 males, 36&#x2009;females) via nonparametric Kruskal&#x2013;Wallis and Mann&#x2013;Whitney U tests (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05).</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Average ages of the OI cohorts were 5.0&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;2.1&#x2009;years, 12.3&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;2.6&#x2009;years, and 42.7&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;15.4&#x2009;years, respectively. Metacarpals of children aged 0&#x2013;8 and 8&#x2013;18&#x2009;years with OI displayed decreased robustness (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05) and lower RCA (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) than age-matched controls, while adult OI metacarpals showed decreased robustness (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) but increased RCA (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) (Figure 1). Male adults and children aged 8&#x2013;18&#x2009;years with OI displayed higher robusticity than age-matched females with OI (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). However, there was no difference in robustness between sexes in children aged 0&#x2013;8&#x2009;years with OI. No effect of prior bisphosphonate treatment was seen on robustness or RCA in any age group.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Bones of children with OI displayed lower robustness and RCA than controls. Adults with OI also showed decreased robustness, indicating more slender and structurally weaker bones, but had higher RCA, which is the expected bone mass accrual pattern for slender bones. These findings suggest that individuals with OI have narrower, structurally weaker bones throughout the lifespan. Critically, lower RCA&#x2014;an indication of low bone mass&#x2014;was only observed for children. While OI could be considered a low bone mass condition in children, the bones of adults with OI may tend to fracture due to other structural and material properties.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Understanding the differences in the growth and aging patterns of bones of individuals with OI across the lifespan is important in informing treatment decisions. This study provides greater insight into the bone morphology in OI based on age, sex, and prior bisphosphonate treatment, which may extend to other osteoporotic populations.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Ollier disease (OD) and Maffuci&#x2019;s syndrome are rare diseases that produce leg length discrepancy and malalignment of long bones. External fixators are traditionally used to address these skeletal deformities. We propose in this case series our experience in motorized lengthening nail technique in such clinical scenarios.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Between 2014 and 2021, we reviewed retrospectively, in four different reference centers, patients with OD and Maffuci&#x2019;s syndrome with leg length discrepancy and had implantable lengthening nails with a minimum follow-up period of 24&#x2009;months. We noted the lengthening rate, lengthening target, clinical tolerance for lengthening, and complications. We measured the bone healing index (BHI) and evaluated all patients&#x2019; EQ-5D-Y functional and visual analog scores (VAS). We also analyzed the regenerate zone and the lengthened long bone to assess the evolution of the pre-existing enchondromas on all the radiographs obtained.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Ten limb segments underwent lengthening with the nailing technique, eight in the femur and two in the tibias. The mean age was 13.3&#x2009;years (range 11&#x2013;16). The mean follow-up time was 53.8&#x2009;months (range 26&#x2013;83). The mean correction amount for the femur and tibia was, respectively, 6.44&#x2009;cm (range 4&#x2013;8) over a mean duration of 76.8&#x2009;days (range 53&#x2013;100) and 3.75&#x2009;cm over 44&#x2009;days (range 38&#x2013;50). We achieved the lengthening goal. The mean VAS score was 6.63 points/15 (range 5&#x2013;8), and the mean EQ-5D-Y was 81/100 (range 70&#x2013;95). The reamed areas showed improvement in the cortical and medullary appearance of the bone, with the healing of enchondromas in eight segments out of 10 (Figure 1). We had no mechanical complications.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The motorized intramedullary lengthening nail is a safe technique in OD and Maffucci&#x2019;s syndrome. It achieves the goals of surgery, therapeutic effect on enchondromas, and satisfactory clinical and functional outcomes with fewer complications than the external fixator technique.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Our findings seem encouraging to use the motorized nail in these patients, but a more extensive prospective series would clarify this.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> The Myelomeningocele Functional Classification (MMFC) provides a comprehensive summary of functional mobility using manual muscle testing in patients with spina bifida. The functional hallmark of MMFC1 patients includes lack of quadriceps musculature (&lt;3 out of 5 strength), but patients may retain iliopsoas function. This functional weakness precludes independent ambulation, yet all patients have the potential to use a supportive stander. Limited data exist on the value of supportive standing; thus, the purpose of this study was to review standing history of MMFC1 spina bifida patients and identify clinical outcomes related to continued supportive standing and its impact on quality of life.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective chart review was performed between 2004 and 2023 of all spina bifida treated at a regional tertiary care center. Patients were excluded if manual muscle testing did not fit criteria for MMFC1 classification. Demographic, clinical factors, and PROMIS scores were reviewed. Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics, with p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05 reaching significance.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> In total, 2228 spina bifida patients were identified with 78 (3.5%) meeting MMFC1 inclusion criteria. Twenty-one patients discontinued standing at an average age of 10 (range 3 to 18). Of the 21 patients who discontinued standing, 14 (67%) patients mentioned worsening contractures as a factor and 5 (24%) patients mentioned ill-fitting standers. Orthopedic clinical outcomes included 33 patients (42%) with at least 1 fracture with 25 (76%) of those patients having a femur fracture. Thirty-nine patients (50%) had at least 1 pressure sore with 23 (59%) of those patients having a sacral or ischial sore. No significant correlations existed between age or weight and number of fractures or pressure sores. However, a significant difference in pressure sores was noted with standing patients having fewer in number (Table 1). See Table 2 for PROMIS score results. A significant difference in Neurogenic Bladder scores was noted with standing patients having fewer bladder symptoms.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> MMFC1 spina bifida patients have a high risk of incurring femur fractures and/or sacral/ischial pressure sores. In addition, patients who continued to stand had better quality of life regarding their bladder symptoms than those who discontinued standing.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> More preventive measures, such as supportive standing, weight management, and patient education are needed in lowering the risk of fractures and pressure sores in MMFC1 patients. Supportive standing may improve health-related quality of life outside of orthopedics, so a multidisciplinary team is needed to prevent barriers such as poor-fitting equipment that may preclude supportive standing in this high-risk population.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Anecdotally, there have been differences noted in sporting function of the clubfoot versus the nonclubfoot side in patients with unilateral corrected idiopathic clubfoot. While asymmetry is expected, the difference in strength, balance, and performance in the feet of the sporting child with unilateral corrected clubfoot has not been well documented. The aim of this study was to measure the sport performance of the clubfoot to the nonclubfoot side of patients with unilateral corrected clubfoot, so that patients with clubfoot and their families can be counseled about sports expectations.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Twenty-seven unilateral clubfoot patients treated with the Ponseti method at a single institution, including some who had been treated for recurrence, between the ages of 8 and 15 were enrolled in a cross-sectional study. Demographics, patient-reported outcome survey, and range of motion were collected for all patients. VALD machines (ForceFrame, ForceDecks, and HumanTrak) were used to measure sport performance. Gait data were collected using pressure-plate-outfitted treadmills and wearable foot sensors. One patient was excluded from gait analysis due to poor data quality. Student&#x2019;s <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-tests and one sample <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-tests were used to assess differences between the non-clubfoot side to the clubfoot side.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Thirty percent were male, with an average age of 11.2&#x2009;years, with a Dimeglio score of 10.5. Sixty-three percent of patients had right-sided clubfoot. Eighty-two percent of patients underwent heel cord tenotomy, 15% anterior tibialis tendon transfer, and 11% other procedures. May need to note our p value threshold. There were no significant differences among many of the performance categories. This included (1) single leg hop, (2) hop and return, (3) running gait, and (4) walking gait. The only differences noted were decreased balance with single-leg stand on the clubfoot side (measured as greater total excursion on clubfoot side, 948&#x2009;mm versus 817&#x2009;mm, and increased mean velocity, 63.2&#x2009;mm/s versus 54.5&#x2009;mm/s, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Similarly, jump height (1.9 inches versus 2 inches, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) was decreased on the clubfoot side.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Overall, no significant differences were noted between the clubfoot versus nonclubfoot side in many of the performance categories including single leg hop, hop and return, running, gait, and walking gait. Significant differences were noted with decreased balance with single-leg stand and jump height on the clubfoot side.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Despite having a clubfoot, most patients can perform on the involved side in a similar way to the nonclubfoot side. Focused physical therapy to improve balance, single-leg stance sway, and jump height may be beneficial.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Flexible flat feet (FF) can interrupt child activity by uneven pressure distributed to the medial column of the foot and may require surgery. A medializing calcaneal osteotomy (MCO) can theoretically restore the foot-tripod complex and alleviate abnormal pressure on the medial side of the foot. The objectives were to compare pedobarography and ankle-foot kinematics in children with symptomatic FF after MCO compared to controls.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> The MCO procedure consisted of medializing the calcaneal tubercle to align with the tibia axis. During the study, gait analysis was performed in 18 children with FF (32 feet) on average of 5.0&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;3.3 (range 1.0&#x2013;13.7) years after MCO. The data were compared to those of 18 controls (36 feet). The average age was 14.4&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;4.9 (range 8.0&#x2013;26.4) years for children with FF and 12.2&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1.2&#x2009;years (range 10.5&#x2013;14.9) years for controls. Maximum pressure, impulse, and contact area were obtained. Ankle-foot kinematics were recorded. The functional outcome was rated by the AOFAS-AHFS score in the FF group.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Sixteen children with FF and 14 controls were male. The average AOFAS-AHFS score was 96. The maximum pressure (N/cm<sup>2</sup>), impulse (Ns/cm<sup>2</sup>), and contact area (cm<sup>2</sup>) for children with FF were significantly higher than controls on the medial column of the foot, most notably in the area under the second-third metatarsal, midfoot, and heel area. In the midfoot, the maximum pressure, impulse, and contact area for FF and controls were 0.71&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;0.6 vs 0.26&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;0.4&#x2009;N/cm<sup>2</sup>, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.007, 0.13&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;0.2 vs 0.04&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;0.1 Ns/cm<sup>2</sup>, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.03, and 48.5&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;13.6 vs 29.8&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;7.2 cm<sup>2</sup>, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001, respectively. Post hoc power analysis at &#x3B1;&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.05 and &#x3B2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.8 was 95.3%. Children with FF had kinematics in dorsiflexion-plantar flexion and abduction-adduction that followed the same movement pattern as controls. However, children with FF demonstrate a higher range of abduction and eversion during the mid and terminal stance phases of the gait cycle. A figure demonstrated pedobarographic and kinematics graphs of the two groups.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Although the functional outcome for children with FF after MCO is excellent, there are areas under the medial column of the foot that demonstrate higher pressure than the data obtained from the matched controls. The abduction and eversion movements are larger.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> The MCO procedure could not normalize the pressure of the midfoot in the FF compared to the controls, and the deformity persisted in the midfoot and forefoot.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Idiopathic clubfoot is a complex congenital foot/ankle anomaly commonly treated by the Ponseti method. This consists of serial manipulation, casting, and typically an Achilles tenotomy. While gross motor function and activity level in childhood is similar among patients without clubfoot, data on sports participation following clubfoot treatment are lacking. The purpose of this study was to describe the prevalence of organized sports participation among children and adolescents with idiopathic clubfoot following Ponseti treatment.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> This is a multicenter cross-sectional survey study. Patients between 5 and 17&#x2009;years of age were included if they had a diagnosis of idiopathic clubfoot and were treated using Ponseti technique during infancy. Parents of subjects were asked to complete a one-time REDCap survey which included basic demographic questions, two validated activity scores (PACE&#x2009;+&#x2009;and PROMIS Physical Activity (PA) 8a sF V1.0), and questions relating to sports participation. A control cohort was composed of the siblings of clubfoot patients.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> One hundred patients with clubfoot and 27 siblings without clubfoot were included. In the clubfoot group, 68% were male compared with 67% in the sibling group (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.90). PROMIS <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-scores were 51.4 (IQR 8.5) vs 57.3 (IQR 11.6) in the clubfoot and sibling groups, respectively (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.004). PACE&#x2009;+&#x2009;scores were lower in the clubfoot group (median 3, IQR 3.5) than those in the sibling group (median 4.75, IQR 2.5, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.03). Sports participation included 77 (77%) patients with clubfoot and all 27 (100%) of the sibling group (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.004). Soccer (clubfoot 37%, siblings 59%), baseball (clubfoot 33%, siblings 41%), basketball (clubfoot 32%, siblings 56%), football (clubfoot 24%, siblings 22%), and swimming (clubfoot 22%, siblings 41%) were the most common sports played in both groups. Among parents of patients with clubfoot, 12 (16%) reported clubfoot stopped their child from participating in specific sports. Difficulty keeping up with peers was a common reason for limitations, reported in nine patients (9%).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These data suggest patients treated for clubfoot with the Ponseti method are active in sports and demonstrate physical activity scores, above the 50<sup>th</sup> percentile for PROMIS-PA. However, lower validated activity scores and withdrawal from sport recorded among patients with clubfoot suggest limitations with activity and sports participation. Further studies looking prospectively at sports participation and injury prevalence are necessary to better understand long-term clinical and functional outcomes in patients treated with Ponseti technique for idiopathic clubfoot.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This study provides helpful information regarding sports participation to share with parents of patients undergoing Ponseti treatment for idiopathic clubfoot.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> The clinical presentation of foot syndactyly and indications for surgical reconstruction are not well described. This study aimed to describe the presentation and treatment of foot syndactyly and to compare nonoperative versus operative treatment outcomes.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Patients presenting with congenital foot syndactyly at a single children&#x2019;s hospital between 2012 and 2022 had affected web spaces, associated syndromes, procedures, and postoperative complications abstracted from the electronic medical record. Patients were contacted by phone to collect information on treatment satisfaction and Wong-Baker pain ratings. They also completed patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures including a modified Australian Hand Difference Register (AHDR) aesthetic questionnaire and PROMIS Mobility and Peer Relations modules. Descriptive statistics and nonparametric tests were used to interpret the data.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 922 web spaces (719, 78.0% bilateral) in 423 patients (166, 39.2% female) were included. Patients presented at an average 1.7&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;3.0&#x2009;years of age, and 98 patients (23.7%) had associated syndromes, most commonly amniotic band syndrome (25) and Apert syndrome (14). Overall, 740/922 web spaces in 309 patients were treated nonoperatively, and 182/922 web spaces in 114 patients underwent surgical reconstruction at an average 2.0&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;2.8&#x2009;years of age with mean follow-up of 0.6&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1.1&#x2009;years. Second web spaces (88/182, 48.4%) were most often surgically reconstructed (Table 1). Nearly one-third of operative web spaces (59/182, 32.4%) experienced late postoperative complications, including hypertrophic scarring (30, 16.4%) and web creep (23, 12.6%). Syndromic association and reconstruction requiring full-thickness skin grafting were significant predictors of late postoperative complications (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.004 and 0.022, respectively). Six web spaces (2.6%) underwent revision procedures. Sixty-five patients completed PROs at an average age of 6.9&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;4.5&#x2009;years. Regardless of treatment type, patients scored within the normal range (50&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;10) on PROMIS Mobility and Peer Relations modules (mean 54.9&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;7.2 and 54.4&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;6.8, respectively) with no significant difference between the two cohorts. Patients who underwent surgical reconstruction reported low, although significantly higher, pain compared to nonoperative patients (1.6&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;2.4 versus 0.3&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1.2, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002). A higher proportion of operative than nonoperative patients &#x201C;strongly agreed&#x201D; or &#x201C;agreed&#x201D; with statements &#x201C;I am happy with how my feet look&#x201D; (43.8% versus 39.6%).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Despite risks of postoperative complications, foot syndactyly reconstruction may remain important for aesthetic satisfaction. However, patients that undergo surgical reconstruction may experience low-level residual pain.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Surgeons should help patients and families weigh the risks of foot syndactyly reconstruction against potential aesthetic advantages.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Sprengel&#x2019;s deformity is a rare congenital anomaly of the scapula, characterized by an undescended or elevated position, inferior tilting of the glenoid, and hypoplasia. There are limited data on the impact of this congenital anomaly, but the existing literature describes reduced shoulder motion and function as well as cosmetic deformity. This study aims to objectively characterize initial clinical presentation and quantify both range of motion and patient-reported function in children with Sprengel&#x2019;s deformity.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Children with Sprengel&#x2019;s deformity were prospectively enrolled into the multicenter Congenital Upper Limb Differences (CoULD) Registry between 2012 and 2023. Shoulder range of motion and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) data were collected from the patient&#x2019;s most recent preoperative follow-up and compared to normative values. PROs included the Pediatric Outcomes Data Collection Instrument (PODCI) and PROMIS Depression, Anxiety, Peer Relations, and Upper Extremity domains. Univariate analysis was performed between bilateral, syndromic, and Cavendish subgroups.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> In total, 59 patients (31, 52.5% female) were included with median age of 5.9&#x2009;years at most recent evaluation. Most patients (53, 89.9%) presented with a unilateral deformity, and a minority of cases (13, 22.0%) were syndromic, predominantly Klippel-Feil Syndrome (9/13, 69.2%). Cavendish Grade III deformity was most common (31/61, 50.8%), followed by 24.6% Grade II, 14.8% Grade I, and 9.8% Grade IV. Average shoulder abduction (113&#xB0;) and forward elevation (120&#xB0;) were significantly less than normal range (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) (Table 1). Children with Sprengel&#x2019;s deformity reported less anxiety/depression than the normative population as indicated by a mean PROMIS Anxiety score of 44.5 (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.017) and a mean Depression score of 45.9 (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.028). Mean PROMIS Upper Extremity scores also trended lower than normative values. Patients scored significantly lower on PODCI Upper Extremity Function, Sports, and Global Function modules than the normative population (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05) (Table 1). PODCI Transfer sub-scores significantly varied by Cavendish classification (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.011) with Grade 1 and 2 deformities scoring within the normal range (average 100.0 and 97.0, respectively) versus Grades 3 and 4 scoring below normal (average 91.0 and 93.5, respectively). Neither bilateral presentation nor syndromic association significantly affected PROs (p&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.05).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Children with Sprengel&#x2019;s deformity have decreased shoulder range of motion, specifically abduction and forward elevation. Regardless of bilateral or syndromic presentation, patients generally demonstrated significantly lower physical function and sports abilities but decreased anxiety and depression compared to unaffected populations. Higher Cavendish grade was associated with worse transfer and mobility function.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Sprengel&#x2019;s deformity, particularly Cavendish Grades 3 and 4, significantly affects physical function.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Bone lengthening has been indicated in various forearm deformities of children. Most authors prefer the distraction osteogenesis using external fixator, while this technique may associate a high complication rate with a long duration wearing it. Lengthening over the plate (LOP) has been used in leg length discrepancies, which is proved to be a reliable technique with reduced external fixation duration. However, its use in forearm deformities has not been reported.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Six patients of forearm deformity (10~18&#x2009;years old, mean: 13.6) have been treated by LOP technique, including three patients of posttraumatic growth arrest and three patients of multiple hereditary exostosis. There were one radial lengthening and five ulnar lengthening patients. Two patients needed additional corrective osteotomy of the associated radial deformity. Lengthening was performed with the aid of monolateral lengthening frame and small locking compression plate. After achieving a desired length, a second step operation was done placing two or three screws at the other side of the plate and removing the external fixator.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> The amount of lengthening averaged 3.0&#x2009;cm (range 2.5&#x2013;3.2&#x2009;cm). Mean time in the fixator was 51&#x2009;days, and mean external fixation index was 18.3&#x2009;days/cm (range 11.6&#x2013;24.8&#x2009;days/cm). All patients achieved a successful healing of distraction callus. Every patient restored the preoperative level of motion in wrist and elbow. There were no major complications which needed surgical procedure. One patient suffered the superficial pin track infection, combined with contact dermatitis.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> LOP procedure of the ulna or radius may be a reliable technique for treating forearm deformities with its discrepancy in children. This technique significantly reduced the duration of external fixation and its related complications.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> The clinical significance of this study is that it introduces a novel technique called LOP for treating forearm deformities in children. LOP involves using a plate and monolateral lengthening frame to achieve bone lengthening, reducing the duration of external fixation and related complications. The study suggests that LOP may be a reliable and effective method for addressing forearm deformities, offering potential benefits in terms of shorter external fixation periods and fewer associated complications.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Interpretation of pediatric elbow radiographs can be challenging due to the eccentric nature of pediatric ossification centers. The purpose of this study is to define the pattern of radial head ossification at different ages of skeletal maturity using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Secondarily, we sought to describe the offset between the ossification centers of the radial head and the capitellum on MRI.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Patients younger than 18&#x2009;years with elbow MRIs completed between January 2011 and September 2022 were identified. We attempted to include at least one study from age and sex. Exams were excluded if there was any trauma to the radial head, or if true coronal or sagittal images were not available. Measurements were performed on the sagittal and coronal views, and the difference between the centers of the cartilaginous and ossified radial heads was calculated as a percentage of the total ossification center. Radio-capitellar offset was also measured on the sagittal and coronal views. Pearson correlation analysis was performed to assess for correlation between radial head ossification offset and radio-capitellar offset with age.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> This study included 66 patients (37 male and 29 female). We were able to obtain images for each age and sex category except for 4-year-old females. Approximately 68% of radial head ossification centers were eccentric in the sagittal plane, and 71% were eccentric in the coronal plane. Of the patients with eccentric ossification centers, the offset was more often posterior and radial. There was no significant correlation between radial head ossification center location and age in the sagittal plane (p&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.05); however, there was a significant correlation between decreasing radial head ossification offset and increasing age in the coronal plane in males (Pearson coefficient &#x2212;0.608, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02). The magnitude of radio-capitellar offset in the sagittal plane was overall small with an average offset of 0.2% for males and 2.6% for females. In the coronal plane, the average radio-capitellar offset was 18% for both males and females. There was no correlation between the magnitude of offset and age (p&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.05).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This is the first study to our knowledge to describe the pattern of radial head ossification. Radial head ossification is eccentric in most patients. Radio-capitellar alignment is less eccentric in the sagittal plane.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Radial head ossification tends to occur eccentrically and does not correlate with age. Eccentric radio-capitellar alignment persists to skeletal maturity but is less in the sagittal plane.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Brachial plexus birth injuries (BPBI) cause permanent impairments in 1 in 1000 live births. The most common injury pattern involves C5&#x2013;6 nerve roots, followed by C5&#x2013;7 and C5&#x2009;T1 injuries. Traditional upper-extremity functional assessments consider gross ranges of motion and classification scores that have inherent measurement limitations and have limited associations with patient-reported outcomes. Reachable workspace offers quantitative and visual measurement of the space the hand can reach around the body. Early investigations demonstrated measurable differences between affected and unaffected limbs, as well as moderate correlation with patient-reported outcomes. However, differences by BPBI injury level have not been assessed. We hypothesized that a reachable workspace would be more limited in patients with greater number of nerve roots injured.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Thirty-six patients with BPBI participated in three-dimensional motion analysis assessment of reachable workspace with real-time feedback. Affected and unaffected limb data were analyzed by octant regions and normalized by arm length. Percent workspace reached, and median reach distances were compared between groups (C5&#x2013;6: n&#x2009;=&#x2009;17; C5&#x2013;7: n&#x2009;=&#x2009;8; C5&#x2009;T1: n&#x2009;=&#x2009;11; unaffected: n&#x2009;=&#x2009;36) for each octant using one-way repeated-measures analysis of variance.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> All BPBI groups had significantly less percent workspace reached than unaffected limbs in the upper regions and lower/posterior/ipsilateral region, and at least one BPBI group did in the remaining regions (Figure 1A). The C5&#x2009;T1 group had significantly less workspace than the C5-6 group in the upper, anterior, ipsilateral region and significantly less workspace than the C5&#x2013;7 group in the lower/anterior/ipsilateral region. Median reach distance was significantly less than the unaffected limbs in at least one BPBI group for all regions except lower/anterior/contralateral (Figure 1B). The C5&#x2009;T1 group had significantly less median reach distance than the C5&#x2013;6 group in both upper/anterior regions.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Reachable workspace demonstrated significant differences between BPBI groups and unaffected limbs across all octants. Reachable workspace also differentiated between BPBI injury levels, particularly in the anterior octants. The octants that had no percent workspace reached differences between BPBI groups had low percent workspace reached across all groups and may either be too low in all BPBI patients to discriminate injury levels or underpowered. Reach distance in the lower regions was similar between all BPBI groups. This study confirmed decreased reachable workspace in the C5&#x2009;T1 group, primarily in the upper/anterior regions.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Reachable workspace is able to differentiate between BPBI injury levels, which expands the utility of reachable workspace as a clinical tool for objective assessment of upper limb reach in children with BPBI.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Patients with upper-limb agenesis (ULA) can potentially benefit from the use of myoelectric prostheses (MP), but their real usefulness, the functions they develop, and the impact on their daily life are unknown. The aim of this study is to demonstrate the usefulness of recreational-therapeutic workshops (RTW) in the use of PM in patients with unilateral ULA using specific assessment scales.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Prospective observational study including patients with unilateral ULA using PM who participated in weekly or fortnightly RTW. These were distributed in three age groups: small (4&#x2013;7&#x2009;years), medium (9&#x2013;12&#x2009;years), and older (14&#x2013;22&#x2009;years). To assess the ability to control a myoelectric prosthetic hand, the Assessment of Capacity for Myoelectric Control (ACMC) scale was used, which consists of 22 items distributed in four areas (grasping, holding, releasing, and re-adjusting the grip). The items are rated on a 4-point scale of varying difficulty, from very easy to very difficult. The results are converted to a linear score from 0 to 100, with 100 being the best score and therefore the greatest skill in the use of the MP. A comparative analysis was performed between the ACMC score before the intervention and at 1-year follow-up using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and a subgroup analysis by areas.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 12 patients, 6 boys and 6 girls, with a median age of 7.5&#x2009;years (IQR, 6&#x2013;11.25) were included in the study. The median preintervention ACMC score was 42.1 (36.83&#x2013;55.4), and the postintervention score at 1 year was 67.1 (50.75&#x2013;73.35), the improvement being statistically significant (18.3 points (8.75&#x2013;30.2); p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.003). The percentual improvement was significant in all areas: grasping (from 35.19% (17.59&#x2013;49.07) to 79.63% (49.07&#x2013;85.19), p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.004), readjusting (from 16.67% (0&#x2013;45.83) to 67.67% (37.5&#x2013;66.67), p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.004), holding (from 60% (46.67&#x2013;83.33) to 100%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.004), and releasing (from 61.11% (30.56&#x2013;66.67) to 86.11% (63.89&#x2013;93.06), p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.014; Figure 1A). The area of readjustment is the one that experienced the greatest improvement, probably due to the lower previous score in that area and to specific training. Regarding the analysis of specific activities, those that experienced the greatest improvement were grasping with support, appropriate grip force during grasping, repetitive grasp and release, holding in motion, and holding in motion without visual feedback (Figure 1B).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> RTWs are an effective tool in patients with unilateral upper-limb agenesis, improving functionality and dexterity in the use of PM myoelectric prostheses.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Children with ULA benefit from RTW to improve their use and functionality of PM.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Cubital tunnel syndrome (CuTS) is uncommon in children with limited literature on presentation, surgical treatment, and outcomes. This investigation aims to describe the clinical presentation of CuTS in a pediatric cohort. We hypothesized that children would predictably return to asymptomatic baseline function following surgery.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective review was conducted of all patients treated operatively for CuTS at a single institution from 2012 to 2023. Patients with acute fracture(s) were excluded. We collected demographics, injury characteristics, management, surgical technique, complications, and outcomes. Descriptive statistics were performed in IMB SPSS v29.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Fifty-six patients (27 males) with 62 involved elbows underwent 64 operations for CuTS at a mean age of 15.7&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;3.1. Twenty-six (58%) patients experienced symptoms in the dominant arm, including most athletes (14/19, 74%). A history of elbow trauma (29/64), including prior fracture (17/64), and sports overuse (24/64) were the most common etiologies. Seventeen of 24 athletes participated in a throwing sport (11 baseball, 5 softball, 1 lacrosse). Eight cases were idiopathic. Common presenting symptoms included pain (78%) and paresthesias (65%). Sixteen (25%) patients presented with weakness, and 7 (11%) with clawing. The most common positive exam maneuver was Tinel&#x2019;s sign (39/50). Eighteen (28%) patients presented without positive exam findings. Electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies were normal in 15/33 (45%) cases; abnormal EMGs included decreased motor unit potentials in 9/11 abductor digiti minimi and 9/14 first dorsal interossei. There were 22 (34%) in situ decompressions, 35 (55%) subcutaneous transpositions, and 7 (11%) submuscular transpositions. Three cases required concomitant centralization or resection of a &#x201C;snapping&#x201D; medial triceps. Both patients with cubitus valgus underwent supracondylar osteotomies. Of 9 medial epicondyle fracture cases, 7 involved fractures initially treated operatively. Fifty-eight (90%) cases resulted in full resolution of symptoms. One case had remaining weakness, and 5 had residual pain/paresthesias. There were no surgical complications. Results are further detailed in Table 1.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> CuTS appears primarily pathology-driven, deviating from the idiopathic presentation common in adults. Patients may present with negative exam and diagnostic findings, so suspicion should be exercised in children with fracture history or athletic overuse. Future work should investigate the utility of primary neurolysis with medial epicondyle fixation. While most children return to baseline with standard surgical treatment, surgeons should be mindful that corrective osteotomy or triceps centralization may be necessary for children with cubitus valgus or snapping triceps, respectively.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Prior elbow fracture and athletic overuse are common etiologies of CuTS in children.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Recent literature has demonstrated that standardized protocols and more limited use of ultrasound can be safely implemented with excellent outcomes in the nonoperative management of infant developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH). Implementation of remote care management across healthcare services is increasingly affording reduced travel and costs to caregivers, with high rates of satisfaction. There was consensus among our clinician team that hybrid in-person and virtual care in clinic would provide numerous improvements in family-centered care. Therefore, we established a new hybrid virtual model of care in our clinic for DDH.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> This quality-improvement study implemented a Plan-Do-Study-Act iterative model. Participant recruitment occurred in a unified multidisciplinary Baby Hip Clinic between December 2022 and June 2023. Practice changes were made to a published comprehensive nonoperative DDH treatment protocol by switching to virtual interim follow-up visits for consultation and examination and omitting ultrasound examination once the hip was centered as per evidence-based guidelines. New online educational resources for caregivers were added to supplement reduced in-person care. A dedicated clinic email was created for streamlined asynchronous clinical advice from healthcare providers. Caregiver and staff satisfaction surveys were administered to collect feedback on satisfaction, clinic flow and perceived quality of care.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Forty-five infants and their caregivers and 20 staff were enrolled in the study. Forty-three infants successfully completed the PH treatment. Two infants failed PH treatment, and two infants developed femoral nerve palsy. No failures of harness treatment or complications occurred during virtual interim follow-up period. Seventy-seven virtual follow-up visits occurred in place of in-person visits. Travel to the clinic was reduced by 6220&#x2009;km for caregivers. Seventy-seven fewer ultrasound scans were ordered, saving $15,500 in imaging costs, compared to previous standardized protocol. The institutional DDH educational website drew 11,800+&#x2009;views, and the new clinic email received 38+&#x2009;emails requesting advice on DDH and harness care. A total of 262 caregiver and 45 staff surveys were completed. Ninety-three percent of caregivers were either satisfied or very satisfied with virtual visits, and 85.1% of staff rated satisfaction with virtual appointments as either good or excellent.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This study successfully streamlined care to minimize in-person visits, made use of the hospital&#x2019;s new virtual care platforms, reduced the need for expensive, scarce imaging resources, and improved caregiver experience while maintaining exceptional clinical results.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Our hybrid virtual Baby Hip Clinic represents an advance in the model of care for nonoperative management for DDH which could increase equitable access, especially for those in remote and economically challenged areas.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Developmental hip dysplasia occurs in up to 3% of human newborns. Diagnosis by a skilled physical examination is limited in detecting the full spectrum of abnormality; thus, hip ultrasound imaging is commonly used, but screening strategies have been controversial. Ultrasound may be limited by availability, cost, and skill, especially in low-resource settings and developing nations. A low-cost, easy-to-use, sensitive screening method would be helpful to assist with early detection. This study investigated the feasibility and potential differences in sound transmission through the hip joint using an ultra-low-cost acoustic screening method to detect developmental hip dysplasia.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A novel device was developed, utilizing band-limited white noise (50&#x2013;1000&#x2009;Hz) as the excitation signal. The signal was transmitted through the hip joint and was captured by a digital stethoscope positioned at the greater trochanter (GT) on each side of the hip joint. The analysis included calculating the transmission amplitude asymmetry between the left and right sides at different frequencies. This was followed by calculating the maximum transfer function (MTF) in the 150&#x2013;900&#x2009;Hz range, the corresponding frequency, and the average coherence. Fifty-six infants were enrolled in the study, comprising 29 hips in 18 patients with confirmed dysplasia (7 unilateral and 11 bilateral cases) based on standard hip ultrasonography. In addition, 38 patients exhibited normal hip morphology on both sides, resulting in 83 hips with normal morphology.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> The mean acoustic frequency at MTF for normal, dysplastic, unstable, and dislocated hips were 464, 459, 561, and 540&#x2009;Hz. Coherence analysis showed mean coherence values of 0.649, 0.668, 0.871, and 0.460 for normal, dysplastic, unstable, and dislocated hips, respectively, suggesting differences in the consistency of sound transmission patterns among these groups. We applied a threshold on the MTF, leading to the successful differentiation between hips with normal morphology and those with dislocated hips. Specifically when the exciter was placed at the ASIS, the method exhibited a sensitivity and specificity of 80% and 79%, respectively.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Detecting differences in the qualities of acoustic transmission across the hip joint in infants is feasible. There are differences in the transmission of sound across a hip joint with and without hip dysplasia.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> The proposed ultra-low-cost acoustic screening method has the potential to differentiate between normal and dislocated hips.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> In Legg-Calv&#xE9;-Perthes disease (LCPD), the femoral head epiphysis is affected by an ischemic event leading to a femoral head necrosis and eventually its deformation. The acetabular involvement of the LCPD-affected hip is not entirely investigated including its chronological appearance and the possible prognostic value of early involvement. This study aimed to evaluate the evolution of the acetabular side in surgically treated patients with Perthes disease. The secondary aim is to evaluate if early acetabular involvement can predict the disease&#x2019;s severity before the fragmentation stage.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> For this retrospective cohort single-center study, radiographs of 80 surgically treated patients between 4 and 12&#x2009;years have been analyzed at diagnosis, at maximal fragmentation, and at healing. Variables of interest were the lateral acetabular inclination, the acetabular depth-to-width ratio, the extrusion index, and Sharp&#x2019;s angle, at both affected and unaffected hip.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> The lateral acetabular inclination of the affected hip became more upward-sloping from diagnosis to healing. The lateral acetabular inclination of the unaffected hip became more downward sloping from diagnosis to healing. The acetabular depth-to-width ratio decreased from diagnosis to healing in the affected hip and remained unchanged in the affected hip. The extrusion index of the affected hip decreased from diagnosis to maximal fragmentation and increased from maximal fragmentation to healing. The Sharp angle of both hips was the largest at diagnosis. In the unaffected hip, the extrusion index remained the same throughout all stages. At the healing stage, the acetabular depth-to-width ratio was significantly smaller in the affected hip than that in the unaffected hip. The extrusion index was significantly larger in the affected hip than that in the non-affected hip. The Sharp angle of the affected hip at the healing stage was significantly larger than that in the unaffected hip at the healing stage. A smaller acetabular depth-to-width ratio at diagnosis was associated with a higher lateral pillar class at maximal fragmentation.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Acetabular changes during the disease&#x2019;s course were detected in all affected hips mostly worsening during the disease&#x2019;s course. Only the acetabular depth-to-width ratio at diagnosis was associated with the lateral pillar class at the fragmentation stage.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> LCPD disease has a consistent impact, and as the disease progresses, the condition of the acetabulum tends to worsen. This information could be critical for clinicians to anticipate and monitor changes in the hip joint over time and could offer options to strategize treatments accordingly. A lower acetabular depth-to-width ratio at diagnosis might predict how the disease will progress.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> In developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH), an objective measure evaluating the medial hip on a pelvis radiograph has yet to be established and commonly used in practice. The acetabular teardrop shape has been described as &#x201C;U,&#x201D; a normal developed teardrop, or &#x201C;V,&#x201D; an abnormal widened teardrop. The V teardrop also corresponds to a laterally displaced hip and is associated with persistent hip dysplasia. An objective measurement that analyzes the medial hip is beneficial to pediatric orthopedic surgeons assessing hip development and stability. Therefore, we created the acetabular teardrop ratio (ATR), a continuous radiographic measurement on an AP pelvis.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Three blinded reviewers retrospectively evaluated patients who underwent open hip reduction for DDH at a single quaternary referral children&#x2019;s hospital. Patients were included if they underwent an open hip reduction, had a preoperative AP pelvis, and had at least 5&#x2009;years of follow-up. Patients were excluded with a diagnosis other than DDH. Radiographs were reviewed for Tonnis grade, acetabular depth ratio, migration percentage, acetabular index, Smith&#x2019;s ratio, and ATR. ATR was calculated by taking the largest width of the teardrop, proximally at the tri-radiate, and dividing it by the teardrop length (Image1).</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Forty-eight patients met inclusion and exclusion criteria. Ten patients underwent bilateral hip open reduction. Fifty-eight hips were evaluated; 43 females and 15 males, and 32 left and 26 right. Average age at surgery was 1.7&#x2009;years (0.3&#x2013;5.7&#x2009;years) with average follow-up duration of 9.6&#x2009;years (5.9&#x2013;6.1&#x2009;years). Twenty-eight hips underwent an additional surgery. ATR (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001) was significantly greater in patients who underwent an additional surgery (0.44, range 0.33&#x2013;0.67) than in those who did not (0.38, range 0.230.49). Acetabular index (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.07) approached significance between patients who underwent an additional surgery, 41&#x2009;degrees (27&#x2013;54&#x2009;degrees), and those who did not, 37&#x2009;degrees (25&#x2013;50&#x2009;degrees). ATR interrater reliability was 0.75.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In DDH with hip dislocation, the medial acetabular teardrop is not well formed. The ATR allows one to quantify how well formed the medial hip is. A larger ratio represents a widened teardrop and a laterally displaced hip than a smaller ratio that represents a medialized, well-reduced hip. This new radiographic measurement can be used to monitor DDH and may be effective in determining associated sequelae of a lateralized hip.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> The ATR is a novel radiographic measurement that can objectively evaluate if a hip is adequately medialized and reduced in DDH.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Iatrogenic femoro-acetabular impingement (FAI) following periacetabular osteotomy (PAO) is a well-documented cause of early failure and poor results. The anterior inferior iliac spine (AIIS) is an increasingly recognized source of extra-articular FAI, and previous studies have documented high rates of AIIS morphologic subtypes at risk for causing FAI in patients undergoing PAO for hip dysplasia. The typical reorientation maneuver to increase anterior and lateral hip coverage during PAO theoretically increases the likelihood of creating subspine impingement. To our knowledge, there are no studies that evaluate the effects of PAO with concomitant AIIS osteoplasty on range of motion (ROM) and function.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> We performed a retrospective study of 63 consecutive hips for 55 patients who underwent PAO with concomitant AIIS osteoplasty between the years 2019&#x2013;2023. All patients underwent pelvic CT with 3D reconstruction including condylar cuts. AIIS was classified using 3D reconstruction, and femoral version was measured on axial CT imaging. ROM of hip internal rotation (IR) at 90&#x2009;degrees was systematically recorded during preoperative exam, intraoperatively following PAO (preosteoplasty and postosteoplasty), and at 6&#x2009;months postoperatively. Merle d&#x2019;Aubign&#xE9; (MDA) scores were calculated preoperatively and postoperatively. IR motion changes across timepoints were compared using repeated-measures ANOVA with post hoc comparisons using a Bonferroni correction. Regression analyses were performed to evaluate the impact of femoral version on motion parameters before and after AIIS osteoplasty. MDA scores were compared using a pairwise <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-test.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Significant clinical improvements in MDA scores were noted at the latest follow-up. Repeated-measures analysis of variance showed significant changes in hip internal rotation following PAO with concomitant AIIS osteoplasty (F&#x2009;=&#x2009;10.9, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01). Table 1 shows hip IR motion across multiple timepoints. IR motion loss was noted following acetabular reorientation, but addition of an AIIS osteoplasty significantly improved IR intraoperatively, and this motion was preserved at long-term follow-up. No differences were noted in hip IR comparing preoperative to postoperative motion. The impact of IR restoration with AIIS osteoplasty correlated significantly with femoral version, with greater motion improvement noted in patients with lower femoral version (t&#x2009;=&#x2009;3.3, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> When planning PAO for hip dysplasia, careful appreciation of motion parameters is critical. Regardless of AIIS morphology, consideration of an intraoperative AIIS osteoplasty should occur in cases where IR is decreased following acetabular reorientation.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Future work to better understand the potential sources of FAI following PAO, including acetabular position and femoral morphology, is important to improve our ability to prevent impingement and improve function.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> There is inconsistency in the literature regarding the relationship between increased birthweight and risk of developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH). This study aimed to investigate the correlation between increased birthweight and ultrasound measurements used in DDH diagnostics (pubo-femoral distances (PFD) and Graf&#x2019;s &#x3B1; angle) in newborns of both sexes undergoing hip ultrasound at 6 weeks of age.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Basic newborn characteristics and ultrasound measurements were retrospectively collected during a 1-year study period. We excluded multiple births, newborns born at less than 37 gestational weeks, and those with incomplete information. Simple and multiple linear regression analyses were performed to evaluate the correlation of birthweight and PFD and second birthweight and &#x3B1; angles including a stratified regression analysis investigating the potential effect modification of sex.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 707 newborns (1414 hips) were included. Mean birthweight was significantly higher for male newborns (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Increased birthweight was positively correlated to PFD values (crude coefficient 0.21 (CI: 0.10&#x2013;0.32)), and the correlation was still present after adjusting for sex, family history, and breech presentation (adjusted coefficient 0.18&#x2009;mm/kg (CI: 0.07&#x2013;0.29)). A regression model was established according to the following: PFD&#x2009;=&#x2009;3.27 (mm)&#x2009;+&#x2009;0.18 (mm) &#xD7; birth weight (kg). The stratified &#x3B1; angle model for males was significant for both the crude coefficient (&#x2212;0.73&#x2009;degrees/kg (CI: &#x2212;1.28 to &#x2212;0.19)) and the adjusted (&#x2212;0.59&#x2009;degrees/kg (CI: &#x2212;1.15 to &#x2212;0.03)), while for females, it was also significant (crude coefficient &#x2212;1.14&#x2009;degrees/kg (CI: &#x2212;1.98 to &#x2212;0.31); adjusted coefficient &#x2212;1.15&#x2009;degrees/kg (CI: &#x2212;1.99 to &#x2212;0.31)). As a result, a regression model was established according to the following: females &#x3B1; angle&#x2009;=&#x2009;69.3&#x2013;1.15 &#xD7; birth weight (kg), and males &#x3B1; angle&#x2009;=&#x2009;69.0&#x2013;0.59 &#xD7; birth weight (kg).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> An increase in birthweight was positively correlated to PFD and negatively correlated to &#x3B1; angles. While the correlations were clinically insignificant, increased birthweight may be a contributing factor to the overall risk of DDH for newborns.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> To our knowledge, this is the first study that examined the influence of increased birthweight on PFD measurements, as well as its effect on &#x3B1; angle measurements in hip ultrasounds of newborns screened for DDH at 6 weeks post-partum. Birthweight may be relevant in the context of a multiple factor risk profile for DDH.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> The common complication after treatment of DDH is type II avascular necrosis (AVN). Traditional treatment methods include varus osteotomy and guided growth of the hip alone. Although both can effectively correct the femoral valgus, they have not improved hip development. Long-leg dysplasia, caused by unsolved leg-length discrepancy (LLD) on the affected side, was thought to account for this condition. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the outcomes of combined hip guided growth and knee growth tethering with varus osteotomy.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> This retrospective study collected patients undergoing combined guided growth and growth tethering (16 patients) or varus osteotomy (18 patients) for caput valgum with LLD during 2009/09~2019/09. Inclusion criteria included children who had undergone open reduction and Pemberton acetabuloplasty for DDH and with a minimum 2-year follow-up after index surgery. Demographic and radiological data, including head-shaft angle (HSA), neck-shaft angle (NSA), center-edge angle (CEA), acetabular index (AI), and leg-length discrepancy (LLD) at baseline, 2 years, and at extended follow-up, were compared. Revision and subsequential surgery were also evaluated.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 16 patients underwent combined guided growth and growth tethering guided growth, and 18 underwent varus osteotomy. There were no differences in demographic and preoperative data. The follow-up CEA, AI showed significant improvement in the combined group, while not in the osteotomy group. The HSA, NSA, and LLD improved significantly in both groups, but rebound phenomenon was observed in the osteotomy group. Regarding hip development and LLD, the combined guided growth and growth tethering group had significant and persistent improvement, while there were unsustainable or insignificant outcomes in the VO group due to the rebound phenomenon. We can reasonably presume that persistent improvement of LLD can effectively avoid long-leg dysplasia and lead to better hip development than guided growth alone.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The outcomes of combined guided growth and growth tethering are superior to osteotomy in terms of LLD and hip development. Both had comparable improvement for caput valgum. Therefore, we recommend such patients receive combined surgery in the future.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> The LLD may interrupt the development of children&#x2019;s hip joints and coronal balance of pelvis. Especially in patients with DDH, long-leg dysplasia was thought to affect the development of the acetabulum on the lesion side, which in turn leads to the rebound phenomenon of acetabular coverage at the posttreatment side. This study verified the phenomenon of long-leg dysplasia and proposed a new surgical strategy for such patients in the future.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Accurate and reproducible measurement of femoral anteversion is essential for preoperative planning of hip reconstructive surgery and treatment of lower limb deformities. Beside clinical assessment (cFA), several methods of radiological femoral anteversion measurements (rFA) can be used. However, the relevance of both clinical and radiological methods is still challenged. The development of three-dimensional modeling allows for greater precision in morphological measurements (3D-FA). The objective of this study is to look for a correlation between these three measurements method.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Clinical femoral anteversion measurements were performed on 26 ambulatory diplegic subjects (52 measurements) before multi-stage surgery. Radiological measurements were performed on 17 subjects (22 measurements) before surgical hip reduction. rFA was measured with the hip flexed at 90&#xB0;, abducted at 40&#xB0;, and internally rotated to align the femoral neck axis with the diaphysis axis. Using low-dose CT scans and 3D preoperative modeling, 3D-FA was measured using CREO Parametric 6.0 software based on geometric primitives. The measurements are compared in a paired manner using Wilcoxon tests, correlation analysis, and graphically using the Bland and Altman method (significance p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05).</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> cFA and rFA show significant differences compared to 3D-FA measurements of 3.40&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;10.23&#xB0; and 9.95&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;7.63&#xB0;, respectively. cFA and rFA show strong correlations (R&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.66; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05) and very strong correlations (R&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.96; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05) with 3D-FA values, respectively.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In comparison to 3D measurement, cFA assessment presents a range of errors comparable to those reported in the literature for CT scans or EOS, while showing higher correlations. rFA measurement has a very strong correlation with 3D measurement but seems to overestimate it by about 10&#x2009;degrees.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Clinical measurements allow for longitudinal tracking of femoral anteversion but should be complemented with 3D assessment for preoperative planning. Radiological assessment allows for intraoperative control; however, it may overestimate the femoral anteversion.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> To explore whether the 16-week duration of Pavlik harness (PH) wear, traditionally employed at our institution, was warranted, by assessment of differences in sonographic appearances at specific timepoints through treatment.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> This was a prospective study of patients successfully treated in PH over a 2-year period. At 6-, 12-, and 16-week time points in treatment, Alpha and Beta angles, femoral head coverage (FHC), plus bony, and cartilaginous acetabular roof morphology was measured. Acetabular Index (AI) was measured at the age of 2&#x2009;years. Three raters made independent measurements. Student&#x2019;s <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-test and Wilcoxon&#x2019;s signed rank test were used to compare variables. Inter-rater reliability was tested with Fleiss&#x2019; Kappa and intraclass correlation coefficient.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> There were 148 hips (102 patients) treated in PH, of which 25 hips (19 patients) were excluded due to early cessation of harness treatment. This left 123 hips (83 patients (69 female; 14 male)) for analysis. Alpha angle was significantly improved at both 12&#x2009;weeks (mean 74.3&#xB0;; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05) and 16&#x2009;weeks (mean 75.3&#xB0;; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01) compared to 6&#x2009;weeks (mean 72.1&#xB0;). Beta angle remained similar throughout (mean 43.1&#xB0; and 44.4&#xB0;; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.1 and p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.98, respectively). FHC was significantly different between the 6-week (mean 75.9%) and 12-week scans (mean 74.1%; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01) but remained similar between 12- and 16-week scans (mean 73.9; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.62). The cartilaginous roof between the 6-, 12-, and 16-week scans showed ongoing significant improvement (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01). The bony roof was significantly improved between 6- and 12-week scans (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01), with no change between 12 and 16&#x2009;weeks (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.0). Mean (SD) AI at age 2&#x2009;years was 21.5 degrees (3.6 degrees). Inter-rater reliability was poor for alpha, beta angles, and cartilaginous roof. The bony roof showed fair agreement only at the 16-week scan. FHC showed substantial agreement, as did the AI.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Almost all improvements in bony morphology of the acetabulum were achieved within 12&#x2009;weeks of PH treatment, indicating that a shorter PH program may be sufficient.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Contrary to the expert consensus of no upper limit to Pavlik Harness use, our study attempts to define the upper limit of standard Pavlik Harness use at around 12&#x2009;weeks, by which time the hip should have normalized.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is one of the most common orthopedic pediatric conditions, affecting 0.1 to 6.6 per 1000 children worldwide. The Pavlik harness is the most used orthosis to treat DDH in children under 6&#x2009;months of age. Severe complications of treatment are rare, but little is known about its impact on child motor development. Pavlik is thought to affect gross motor skill acquisition, and parents of DDH patients often inquire about Pavlik treatment&#x2019;s impact on gross motor skill acquisition. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the impact of Pavlik harness treatment of children with DDH on their gross motor skills development, in comparison with normal counterparts without an orthopedic condition.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A prospective case-control study was designed. Cases were defined as children diagnosed with DDH. Children with other orthopedic or neurological conditions or in the need for other treatment were excluded. Data regarding sex, medical history (including obstetric and birth data), family history (first degree relative with DDH), clinical signs of DDH (asymmetric skin folds, positive Ortolani maneuver, positive Barlow maneuver, positive Galeazzi test, and limitation of the abduction of the hip), and duration of treatment were registered. Controls were recruited from routine evaluation appointments by their family doctor at a local health center. Parents were given a diary for registering time acquisition of all three development milestones considered in our study (sitting without support, hands-and-knees crawling, and walking alone). Statistical significance level was established at p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> The groups had no differences regarding sex distribution, gestational age, birth weight, and rate of twin pregnancy. The prevalence of positive family history of DDH (20.0% vs 3.0%, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.003), breech presentation (38.2% vs 1.5%, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), and C-section delivery (60.0% vs 19.7%, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) was significantly higher in the DDH group. Median age of first orthopedic evaluation was 3.3&#x2009;months (1.4&#x2013;9.1&#x2009;months). End of treatment was at a median age of 7.0&#x2009;months (3.9&#x2013;12.6&#x2009;months), with 29 children (52.3%) finishing treatment after 6&#x2009;months of age. Children with DDH achieved the three gross milestones evaluated 1 month later than healthy controls, but this was not statistically significant (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.133 for sitting, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.670 for crawling, and p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.499 for walking).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Children with DDH, treated by Pavlik harness, do not have significant delays in motor skills acquisition.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Pavlik Harness is an effective and safe alternative for DDH treatment, without harming motor development.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> The evolution of Legg-Calv&#xE9;-Perthes (LCP) disease remains unpredictable in Herring B, B/C, and C hips, and whether surgical or conservative treatment should be applied remains controversial. The aim of the study was to evaluate the natural course of the LCP in children who fulfill the criteria for surgical intervention but in whom nonoperative management was undertaken regardless of the reason, to predict the best therapeutic attitudes.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A total of 165 Herring B, B/C, and C hips treated nonsurgically were included in this multicentric retrospective study. The hip radiographs, index of Reimers, and Herring classification were evaluated at the time of diagnosis, 3&#x2009;months, 6&#x2009;months, 1&#x2009;year, and&#x2009;&gt;3&#x2009;years. The worst Herring stage for each hip was considered. The existence of a toto-epiphysary fissure and its position regarding the acetabular rim were noted. The primary endpoint was modified Stulberg classification. To identify prognostic factors impacting the final outcome (modified Stulberg classification), logistic regression was performed, with the modified Stulberg classification as the dependent variable and demographic, radiological, and therapeutic factors as independent variables.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> The worst Herring stage was Herring B (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;62), Herring B/C (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;13), and Herring C (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;90). Eighty-five hips had an index of Reimers&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;20&#xB0; and were considered extruded. A toto-epiphysary fissure was found in 35 hips, among which nine were facing the acetabular rim. Modified Stulberg was A (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;111; 67%), B (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;26; 16%), and C (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;28; 17%). Logistic regression showed that the final outcome was influenced by the age at diagnosis (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01), extrusion of the femoral head (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002), presence and location of a toto-epiphysiary fissure (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001), and Caterall &#x201C;head-at-risk&#x201D; signs (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Contrary to other studies, this one showed that Herring at diagnosis as well as its worst stage during evolution might not predict the outcome of LCP disease. Outcome of nonoperated hips that should have been treated surgically yielded satisfactory results regardless of Herring classification. Age at diagnosis, femoral head extrusion, and Caterall head-at-risk signs were correlated with final outcome. A new prognostic factor, the toto-epiphysary fissure facing the acetabular rim might also be an indicator of bad evolution and dictate eventual treatment modality.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> LCP hips have a less-predictable outcome than previously thought, and their final outcome is dependent on multiple radiographic and clinical factors. A case-by-case approach should be undertaken to treat this disease, and further studies may be required to identify new prognostic factors to help with treatment.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Hypothyroidism is a known risk factor for slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE), and prior studies of hypothyroid-associated SCFE have demonstrated an incidence of up to 6%. However, there is limited evidence and no formal practice guidelines regarding whether patients presenting with SCFE should undergo screening for endocrine disorders. This study aims to investigate the incidence of abnormal thyroid function studies in patients presenting with SCFE.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> This was a retrospective review of all patients treated for SCFE at a single pediatric hospital from January 2015 to July 2022. On presentation, patients&#x2019; BMI and relevant laboratory testing at discretion of treating surgeon, including thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), free T4, vitamin D, creatinine, BUN, and HbA1c levels, were documented. Follow-up and treatment for any identified endocrinopathies were noted. In addition, the chronicity, stability, and severity of their slips were recorded.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Ninety-eight patients with 106 hips were included in this study. TSH was obtained at time of initial presentation in 66.3% (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;65/98) of patients. Median TSH was 2.99 (range: 0.02&#x2013;919, SD: 132.4). The normal reference range for our institution is 0.5&#x2013;4.5 mcIU/mL. Of the patients with a documented TSH, 32.3% (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;21/65) had an abnormal value. Of those patients who had an elevated TSH, three were diagnosed with clinical hypothyroidism and went on to treatment with levothyroxine (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;3/19, 15.8%), two patients had been started on levothyroxine prior to presentation (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;2/19, 10.5%), and two patients were followed in endocrinology clinic until their TSH levels had normalized without further intervention (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;2/19, 10.5%).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Screening of our SCFE population revealed a 32.3% incidence of thyroid abnormalities, which affected treatment in 23.8% of those patients. This is a much higher incidence of hypothyroid-associated SCFE than previously demonstrated in the literature and has prompted us to include TSH with reflex T4 as a routine part of our workup for all SCFE patients.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Given the relatively high incidence of thyroid screening abnormalities for patients presenting with SCFE, we recommend that TSH and reflex T4 testing be standard of care for patients presenting with SCFE to increase the likelihood of identifying occult endocrine disease and begin appropriate treatment.</p>

        <title>Optimizing the arthrogram: does local anesthetic improve the duration of femoral head visualization?</title>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Closed reduction and spica casting for hip dysplasia is one of the most commonly performed procedures in pediatric orthopedics. As the fluoroscopic visualization of the arthrogram inevitably fades with time, one technical challenge is maintaining adequate visualization of the hip joint from initial closed reduction through final evaluation in spica cast. The purpose of this study was to objectively evaluate our anecdotal experience that a combination of local anesthetic plus radiopaque dye has an improved duration of femoral head visualization as compared to dye alone.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A total of 30 femurs from fifteen 14-day-old mice were harvested and debrided of all attached soft tissues and capsule. The femurs from each mouse were then randomly assigned to one of three groups: 25% dye, 50% dye, or 75% dye. Within each group, one femur was incubated for 10&#x2009;minutes in a dye plus 1% lidocaine solution (experimental group) while the other was incubated in dye plus saline (control group). Each femur was then washed, incubated in saline, and serially radiographed in 5-minute intervals. The visible volume of the femoral head region immediately following incubation was used as a baseline, and each subsequent timepoint was expressed as a fraction of this volume. The brightness of the femoral head in each radiograph was measured by taking the average greyscale of the region and multiplying it by the total volume of the visible region to obtain a quantitative measure of femoral head staining. Results were then averaged across all femurs from each group.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> As compared to controls, the dye plus lidocaine group had an increased fraction of the femoral head visible by radiographs across all three tested concentrations (Figure 1). The differences were most pronounced at 15&#x2009;minutes after incubation, with the 25% dye, 50% dye, and 75% dye groups displaying 20%, 12%, and 11% increases in fraction of femoral head visible on radiograph, respectively. Overall, the 25% dye plus 75% lidocaine group displayed the greatest differences from their respective controls.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These findings suggest that combining a radiopaque contrast agent with a local anesthetic may serve to enhance the duration of femoral head visualization by delaying the diffusion of the dye away from the cartilaginous femoral head. Additional work is needed to translate this technique to clinical practice.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Diluting arthrogram dye with local anesthetic may be a useful clinical trick for improving fluoroscopic interpretation of the femoral head during closed reduction and spica casting for hip dysplasia.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Osteochondral lesions of the femoral head in young patients are a rare but challenging clinical problem. Fresh osteochondral allograft (OCA) transplantation is a restorative treatment option which may improve function and delay hip arthroplasty, but there is a paucity of published data. The purpose of this study was to assess allograft survivorship and patient-reported outcomes in patients undergoing OCA transplantation for osteochondral lesions of the femoral head.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Eighteen patients (19 hips) who underwent femoral head OCA transplantation between 1985 and 2021 and had a minimum 2-year follow-up were included. Indications included avascular necrosis (84%), osteochondritis dissecans (5%), chondroblastoma (5%), and cystic lesion (5%). Median age was 15.7&#x2009;years, and 63% were male. Median allograft size was 25&#x2009;mm, and median thickness was 9&#x2009;mm. Evaluation included frequency and type of further surgery, Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS), Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), modified Harris Hip Score (mHHS), and UCLA function score. Clinical failure was defined as conversion to arthroplasty.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Six of 19 hips (32%) experienced clinical failure (5 total hip arthroplasties and 1 resurfacing arthroplasty), with a median time to failure of 3.8&#x2009;years (range, 1.0&#x2013;8.5&#x2009;years). All these failures were in patients with femoral head osteonecrosis. Allograft survivorship was 82.0% at 3&#x2009;years and 64.6% at 5&#x2009;years (Figure 1). Of the remaining 13 hips, the median follow-up duration was 3.4&#x2009;years (range, 1.9&#x2013;9.5&#x2009;years). At the latest follow-up, median HOOS was 74.7, median WOMAC was 80.7, median mHHS was 81, and mean UCLA score was 7.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Young patients with large osteochondral lesions of the femoral head may benefit from fresh OCA transplantation. OCA is a useful treatment option that preserves function and delays the need for arthroplasty in young individuals with osteochondral lesions of the femoral head.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Although rare, osteochondral lesions in young patients can have devastating lifelong implications. We have found that treatment with osteochondral allograft may provide many of these patients with relief of clinical symptoms and may delay arthroplasty in this younger population.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> A body of research has consistently demonstrated the safety and efficacy of combining hip arthroscopy with periacetabular osteotomy (PAO) as a viable treatment modality for patients afflicted with symptomatic acetabular dysplasia and intra-articular pathology. However, it is important to note that the previously reported excellent short- and mid-term outcomes have largely relied on a relatively limited patient cohort.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Data were prospectively collected from October 2010 to January 2018. Patients were included in this study if they underwent concomitant hip arthroscopy and PAO and if they had preoperative scores documented for the following patient-reported outcomes (PROs): modified Harris Hip Score (mHHS), Nonarthritic Hip Score (NAHS), Hip Outcome Scored Sports-Specific Subscale (HOS-SSS), and pain on a visual analog scale (VAS). Follow-up was considered complete with these outcomes collected after surgery, as well as the International Hip Outcome Tool (iHOT-12) and patient satisfaction on a 0&#x2013;10 scale. Significance was set at p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Thirty-four patients were eligible, all of whom had complete follow-up at a minimum of 5&#x2009;years after surgery. There were 30 female subjects. The average age of the patients was 23.5&#x2009;years (range, 12.3&#x2013;35.3&#x2009;years), and the average body mass index was 25.4&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;8.77 (range, 12.3&#x2013;50.3). The mean lateral center-edge angle increased from 15.8 to 30.2 (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001), and the anterior center-edge angle increased from 16.4 to 31.3 (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001). The T&#xF6;nnis angle of acetabular inclination decreased from 15.6 to 4.6 (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001). The alpha angle decreased from 53.4 to 43.6 (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001). Thirty patients had a preoperative T&#xF6;nnis grade of 0, six patients had a preoperative T&#xF6;nnis grade of 1, and one patient had a preoperative T&#xF6;nnis grade of 2. There was no progression of arthritis in radiographs taken at the latest clinical visit. All patient-reported outcomes scores demonstrated significant improvement from preoperative baseline to the minimum 5-year follow-up scores (mHHS; NAHS; HOS-SSS, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001). The VAS score decreased from a preoperative mean of 5.4 to 1.9 at the latest follow-up (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001). Four patients had a conversion to a total hip arthroplasty.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Concomitant hip arthroscopy and PAO appears to be a safe and effective procedure with favorable mid-term outcomes that are durable compared to the short-term outcomes.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> To report minimum 5-year follow-up results of concomitant hip arthroscopy followed by periacetabular osteotomy (PAO) to treat acetabular dysplasia and intra-articular pathology, such as femoro-acetabular impingement syndrome and labral tears.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Pathologic femoral neck fractures pose a challenging clinical problem due to the nature of the fracture and the compromised bone stock for fixation. Different fixation types may be utilized, including proximal femoral locking plates (PFLP), which remain controversial for use in femoral neck fractures but may provide adequate mechanical fixation in pathologic bone. Limited literature is available on these patients and suggests a low rate of avascular necrosis (AVN). The purpose of this study is to report outcomes of children with pathologic femoral neck fractures treated with various fixation techniques including PFLP.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> We retrospectively reviewed all surgically treated pathologic femoral neck fractures in patients&#x2009;younger than 18&#x2009;years between 2003 and 2018. Cases were reviewed for underlying pathology of fracture, fracture location by Delbet Classification, surgical fixation, and reoperation. Radiographs were evaluated for osseous union within 1&#x2009;year of treatment, and AVN at the final follow-up.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Twenty-two patients were identified with mean age at surgery of 9.7&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;3.7&#x2009;years (range 3.7&#x2013;16.8&#x2009;years) and mean follow-up of 3.9&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;2.9&#x2009;years. Five patients (23%) were female. Pathologies included benign bone cyst (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;11, 50%), fibrous dysplasia (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;3, 14%), osteogenesis imperfecta (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;3), osteopetrosis (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;1, 5%), Gaucher disease (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;1), Duchenne muscular dystrophy (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;1), Langerhans cell histiocytosis (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;1), and spondylometaphyseal dysplasia (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;1). The distribution of fractures by Delbet classification included 54% Delbet II, 32% Delbet III, and 14% Delbet IV. Surgical fixation was performed with PFLP (68%), dynamic hip screw (9%), cannulated screws (9%), flexible intramedullary nails (9%), or Kirschner wires (5%). Radiographically, 18 patients (82%) demonstrated osseous union within 1&#x2009;year, with three undergoing revisions for nonunion. Within the PFLP group, the union rate was 73%. Only three (13%) developed AVN at the final follow-up. Reoperation was performed in 9 (41%) patients: 4/9 (44%) elective removal of hardware or revision of fixation due to growth, 3/9 (33%) nonunion, and 2/9 (22%) for peri-implant fracture (neither involving PFLP fixation).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This study provides further evidence of the relatively low risk of AVN in pediatric pathologic femoral neck fractures compared to higher energy traumatic femoral neck fractures. PFLP may be considered to provide stable fixation in compromised bone.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This is the largest reported series evaluating characteristics and surgical outcomes of children with pathologic Delbet I-IV femoral neck fractures.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) who present late with severe acetabular dysplasia can be treated with a Bernese PAO with improved radiographic parameters. However, their functional and gait data have not been studied previously. The purpose of this study is to analyze a cohort of CMT patients who have undergone a Bernese PAO for acetabular dysplasia to define their overall radiographic and gait results.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> This is a retrospective analysis of a consecutive series of CMT patients who underwent a Bernese PAO for acetabular dysplasia with at least 2-year follow-up. Gait analysis was performed with 3D motion capture via a 12-camera VICON system to obtain kinematic variables. Patients were fitted with a modified Helen Hayes marker set and instructed to walk at a self-selected speed, and kinetic data were captured with embedded Advanced Mechanical Technology force plates. Comparisons were made between preoperative and 2-year postoperative data and between 2-year postoperative data and controls. All patients completed a modified Harris Hip score (mHHS) questionnaire (maximum 89) and UCLA activity scores (maximum 10) at each time point.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Eight patients (8 females) with an average of 15.5&#x2009;years at surgery were enrolled. The radiographic parameters improved from preop to 2&#x2009;years for lateral center edge angle (&#x2212;20.1 to 11.8&#xB0;, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002) and Tonnis angle (38.3&#x2013;15.6&#xB0;, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0017). There was no difference when comparing preoperative and 2-year follow-up for hip flexor power (0.97 versus 0.96&#x2009;W/kg) or hip abductor impulse (0.13 versus 0.16 Nm/kg-s). There also was no difference in the preoperative/postoperative gate deviation index (GDI) (76.3 vs 76.8). When comparing the 2-year data of CMT patients to controls, hip flex power was less (0.97 vs 1.45&#x2009;W/kg, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02), and abductor impulse was lower (0.16 vs 0.30 Nm/kg-s, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.004). The mHHS improved at 2&#x2009;years compared to preoperatively (83.6 vs 67.9, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.04) without a change in the UCLA activity score (6.7 vs 5.6, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.39).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> CMT patients undergoing a Bernese PAO for acetabular dysplasia have significantly improved radiographic parameters and self-reported outcomes without a change in their activity level. Gait data at 2&#x2009;years postoperatively demonstrated return-to-baseline parameters in the coronal and sagittal planes but were lower than controls and reflect the underlying condition.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Preoperatively, CMT patients can be counseled that with proper rehabilitation, they should be able to regain their baseline function by 2&#x2009;years after undergoing an uncomplicated Bernese PAO.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Legg-Calv&#xE9;-Perthes disease induces a residual deformity showing as an ellipsoidal shape. This is related to the asymmetric growth of the femoral head physis. The objective is to assess the effectiveness of a hemiepiphysiodesis of the healthy physis in the posteroinferior quadrant as a means of disrupting femoral head ovalization in cases of LCPD disease for those who had started an ovalization process.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> We carried out a prospective study of 39 LCPD disease hips operated by hemiepiphysiodesis of the posteroinferior quadrant during the reossification phase. Surgical indication was based on (a) an increasing in the ellipsoidal index; (b) the presence of a double epiphyseal nucleus of Reossification; (3) physeal narrowing; (4) physeal angulation. Hemiepiphysiodesis was carried out at the mean age patient of 8.8&#x2009;years (SD 1.5) and a mean of 4.7&#x2009;years (SD 1.4) after the onset of the disease (Figure 1).</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> We found a preoperative ellipsoidal index 1.80 (SD 0.2), which was decreased to 1.72 (SD 0.2) in cases operated by hemiepiphysiodesis (p&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.05). Physeal angulation increased from 50&#xB0; preoperatively (SD 9.3) to 54.29&#xB0; (SD 9.7) at the end of growth (p&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.05) in cases operated by hemiepiphysiodesis. The final result according to the Stulberg classification showed 20 Class-II cases, 16 Class III, and 3 Class IV, and SDS was 25.97 (SD 9.95; range: 9.36&#x2013;51.67; Table 1; Table 2; Figure 2).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> As revealed by the ellipsoidal index, the ovalization of the femoral head can be stopped by a selective hemiepiphysiodesis in the posteroinferior quadrant.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Hemiepiphysiodesis in the posteroinferior quadrant of the affected femoral head improves the sphericity. It is accepted that a rounder femoral head improves joint congruity and, therefore, function and pain, which could allow an active quality of live in the most productive years of life.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is a common disorder of atypical hip development. Pelvic osteotomy (e.g. according to Salter, Pemberton or Dega) may be indicated for children with DDH at walking age. The most popular postoperative treatment is a hip spica cast. Alternative postoperative options include abduction braces and non-weight-bearing protocols combined with physical therapy. The aim of this systematic review was to determine the most effective form of postoperative treatment after unilateral pelvic osteotomy in children with DDH in terms of clinical and radiological outcomes and complications.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A systematic review was conducted and reported according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis 2020 guidelines and registered in the International prospective register of systematic reviews. Articles were selected from PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases. The quality of all (non-)randomized included studies was assessed using the Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS) criteria.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> The search strategy yielded 3524 articles. Fourteen articles with 367 hips were included in this review. A total of 312 hips were treated with spica casts, 49 with abduction braces, and 6 with non-weight-bearing protocols. The quality of evidence was moderate (MINORS, 3&#x2013;12 points). All types of postoperative treatments had good clinical outcomes overall, without secondary displacement of the osteotomy. Clinical outcomes for spica casts were reported according to McKay&#x2019;s criteria in 135 hips, with 123 excellent and 12 good results. Clinical outcomes for abduction braces and avoidance of weight-bearing showed satisfaction for all parents (49 out of 49). The radiological outcome was overall well preserved with any postoperative treatment. There was a higher complication rate with the use of hip spica casts, including avascular necrosis, pain complaints, and superficial infections.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This systematic review showed no benefit of postoperative spica casts compared with abduction braces and avoidance of weight-bearing after simple pelvic osteotomy for residual DDH.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> These findings may be of interest, as the unilateral pelvic osteotomy is a very common procedure, and the results of the review may affect treatment protocols.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Gallows traction is used at our hospital before open reduction in infants with developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH). Theoretically it reduces height of hip dislocation and in turn soft-tissue tension, allowing an easier surgical reduction and therefore lower complications including redislocation and avascular necrosis (AVN). Owing to the lack of evidence regarding its use prior to open reduction, this study aims to quantify whether traction is safe, and whether it is effective.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Notes and charts of 80 patients undergoing preoperative traction were retrospectively reviewed for any complications. The height of hip dislocation was classified using the IHDI classification system on both radiographs taken before and after traction. The requirement of femoral shortening osteotomies and redislocation rate was further recorded. The avascular necrosis rate (Kalmachi-McEwan) and radiological appearance (Severin) at most recent follow-up were recorded (mean 6&#x2009;years).</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> There were no permanent neurovascular complications in this cohort. Only two babies were complicated with broken skin sores; however, surgery still progressed. Before traction, 49 hips were classified as grade IV, 27 hips were grade III, and 4 hips were grade II. Following 1 week of preoperative traction, resting position was grade IV in 24 hips, grade III in 37 hips, and grade II in 19 hips. The median IHDI grade before traction was 4 compared to 3 after traction, a statically significant decrease in height of dislocation following traction: IHDI 3, z&#x2009;=&#x2009;&#x2212;5.51, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.00001. No hips in the cohort required femoral shortening surgery, and the redislocation rate was 0%. Eighty-four percent of hips had no or minimal AVN (grade 0&#x2013;1). Ninety-six percent of hips were classed as either excellent or good radiologically (Severin 1 and 2) at the last follow-up.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Traction was found to be safe when used in infants weighing&#x2009;&lt;12&#x2009;kg. One week of preoperative traction appears to significantly improve the resting position of the hip in high-degree dislocations. The AVN rate and radiological appearance at follow-up are excellent. This study supports the theoretical use of traction ahead of DDH open reduction surgery in high-grade dislocations.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This is the first study to identify that preoperative traction appears to significantly improve the resting position of the hip in high-degree dislocations prior to surgical reduction. Second, despite the practicalities of the traction regime, this study demonstrates that traction is effective at reducing complication postsurgical reduction, supporting its use.</p>

        <title>Radiation burden and associated cancer risk among children undergoing open reduction for developmental dysplasia of the hip</title>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Radiological imaging plays an important role in the diagnosis and treatment of developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH), ensuring cases are not missed and helping monitor postinterventional response. However, radiological surveillance comes with risk including increased cancer incidence. Children undergoing open reduction for DDH represent a particularly vulnerable group given their additional imaging burden. The purpose of our study was to quantify the added radiation that children undergoing open reduction for DDH are exposed to and the associated lifetime cancer risk.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Records of children undergoing open reduction for DDH at a tertiary center were reviewed. Children who had their operation and completed follow-up to a minimum age of 7.5&#x2009;years at the center were included in the study. X-rays, fluoroscopic events, and CT scans relevant to the DDH diagnosis and treatment were analyzed. Age at the point of imaging, tube voltage, and dose area product of each imaging episode were used in conjunction with published conversion factors to calculate the effective dose that a child was exposed to during each episode. The cumulative effective dose was calculated and converted to a cancer lifetime risk using established risk models.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Thirty-nine patients were retrospectively analyzed. Seventy-eight percent of children were female, and the mean age at follow-up was 10.18&#x2009;years. The mean number of x-rays a child underwent was 13.85, and the average number of CT scans and fluoroscopic events was 1.31 and 2.98, respectively. The average effective dose across the cohort was 2.11 mSV, and the associated added lifetime cancer risk was 1:4692. Patients who had more than one operation during their DDH treatment were exposed to twice the amount of radiation during their clinical journey (single operation: 1.70 mSv vs two or more operations: 3.32 mSV).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Radiation exposure of children undergoing open reduction for DDH is within safe limits, and the associated cancer risk is considered low by the United Kingdom&#x2019;s National Radiological Protection Board. Although the effective dose is roughly 10 times higher than that for children undergoing Pavlik harness treatment for DDH and rises further with additional surgery, the total dose is still approximately only one third of the USA&#x2019;s average annual background radiation dose.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Healthcare teams and families can be reassured that the radiation risk stemming from children undergoing open reduction is low. While efforts should be made to reduce radiation exposure within children, this should not come at the expense of clinically indicated imaging needed to help improve outcomes.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> A previous large prospective multicenter study of patients with Perthes disease found no significant differences in the outcome between 5 common treatments: no treatment (No Tx), range-of-motion therapy (ROM), bracing, femoral varus osteotomy (FVO), and Salter osteotomy (SO). One major limitation of the study was the use of Stulberg classification which lessens the statistical power of the study due to its categorical and subjective nature. The purpose of this study was to re-analyze the treatment outcomes and prognostic factors of the large prospective study using a continuous, quantitative outcome measure called the sphericity deviation score (SDS).</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Of 345 hips included in the original study, 26 hips were excluded for poor image quality (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;6), late-stage at treatment (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;12), and bilaterality, keeping 1 hip/case (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;8), leaving 319 hips for reanalysis. All patients were treated at Waldenstr&#xF6;m stage 1 or 2 and followed to skeletal maturity. SDS was measured by two independent observers with ICC of 0.891 (95% CI 0.817&#x2013;0.930, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Both bone age (BA) and chronological age (CA) at onset were used. Statistically, treatment outcomes stratified by significant prognostic factors on the multivariate regression analysis were compared, and regression tree models were also employed.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> BA&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;6&#x2009;years (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), CA&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;8&#x2009;years (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.030), and male gender (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.062) were included in the multivariate model as favorable outcome predictors. For patients with BA&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;6&#x2009;years, there was no significant difference in SDS outcome between the treatment groups (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.476). For patients with BA&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;6&#x2009;years, the FVO and SO groups showed significantly better SDS outcome than the No Tx/ROM group (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.025) but not the bracing group. The proportion of the patients with SDS&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;10 (shown to correlate with Stulberg class I or II hips) was highest in the FVO (27.3%) and SO (26.5%) groups, followed by the brace (14.5%) and No Tx/ROM (5.3%) groups. When stratified by CA, no significant difference was observed between the treatment groups. The regression tree model indicated BA as the most significant prognostic factor.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our new analysis using SDS revealed significantly better treatment outcomes in the FVO and SO groups than the No Tx/ROM group in patients with BA&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;6&#x2009;years. The analysis also revealed BA as the most significant prognostic factor.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> While this study indicates better SDS outcome with FVO or SO in patients with BA&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;6, only a modest proportion of patients achieved SDS&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;10 (i.e. spherical femoral head).</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Patients present with hip pain, with and without radiographic findings indicating cause of hip pain. The purpose of this study was to better understand self-reported pain scores at clinical presentation, degree of hip dysplasia, and implications for orthopedic interventions.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> An institutional review board (IRB)-approved retrospective study was completed on patients aged 12&#x2013;40 years who were diagnosed with developmental dysplasia of the hip, presenting to a large pediatric orthopedic service between 2015 and 2023. Patients who had underlying neuromuscular or congenital anomalies were excluded. Demographics, Visual Analog Scale (VAS) pain scores, medications, and behavioral health (BH) diagnoses/treatment were collected. Radiographs were measured using lateral center-edge angle (LCEA) to define degree of dysplasia;&#x2009;&lt;25&#xB0; defined as &#x201C;dysplastic&#x201D;; LCEA 5&#xB0;&#x2013;15&#xB0; is moderate;&#x2009;&lt;5&#xB0; is severe. Comparative means statistical analyses were completed with univariate analysis of variance to identify statistical significance.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 297 charts were reviewed. Of the total, 123 met inclusion criteria (age: 21.9&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;7.3 years, BMI: 25.07&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;5.2). Patients were white (92%), female (88%), teenagers (53%), and were privately insured (75%). VAS scores (max 10) averaged 4.0&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;2.7; 42% (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;52) reported mild pain (VAS 0&#x2013;3); 37% (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;46) reported moderate pain (VAS 4&#x2013;6); and 20% (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;25) reported severe pain (VAS 7&#x2013;10). Mean LCEA was 15.4&#xB0;&#xB1;&#x2009;8.1&#xB0;. Those who reported severe pain scores had the highest LCEA average of 18&#xB0;. Average LCEA in no pain/mild pain group was 14&#xB0;. Pain scores and LCEA average approached significance (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.056). Ninety-six hips were treated surgically; 27 hips were nonsurgical. Thirty-eight percent (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;36) in the surgical group reported no pain or mild pain with average LCEA 13&#xB0;; 22% (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;21) reported severe pain and average LCEA 18&#xB0;. Forty percent in the nonsurgical group reported moderate to severe pain with mild hip dysplasia. Forty percent (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;49) of all patients had a BH diagnosis. Eighteen percent with depression, 31% anxiety disorder(s), 22% attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), 12% behavioral concerns, 8% osteochondritis dissecans (OCD), and 10% history of suicidal ideation. Seventy-one percent were prescribed psychotropic medication. No significance in reported pain scores for those with or without BH diagnosis (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.232).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Over half of all adolescents/young adults who present to clinic with hip dysplasia complain of moderate to severe pain. There is an inverse correlation between severity of dysplasia and pain. Nearly half have an underlying BH diagnosis that may play a role in presentation and treatment plans.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> While hip pain may develop as part of degenerative process, pain should not be the primary indication for surgical intervention. It is important to evaluate functional and psychological factors which may contribute to self-reported pain and inform treatment plans.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> To explore whether a broken Shenton&#x2019;s line does truly indicate underlying pathology in children with developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH).</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Data were collected prospectively on all babies treated in Pavlik harness at our children&#x2019;s hospital over an 18-month time frame. Babies were included in the study if they were clinically and radiologically normal at 5&#x2009;years of age and had had anterior-posterior radiographs available from three time points: 1, 2, and 5&#x2009;years of age.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> There were 101 children (170 hips) with full imaging available for inclusion in this study. Sixty-nine (69%) of these children had a broken Shenton&#x2019;s line(s) on radiographs at 1&#x2009;year of age, 62 (61%) at 2&#x2009;years of age, and 36 (35%) at 5&#x2009;years of age, despite all children being clinically and otherwise radiologically normal. All other radiological parameters were within normal range. A broken Shenton&#x2019;s line was also seen in the contralateral, nondiseased hip of 30/32 (94%) children with unilateral DDH, at one or more time point.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Using Shenton&#x2019;s line to interpret normality or pathology in pediatric hips is no better than flipping a coin. It should be interpreted with caution in the radiological assessment of children with DDH. A broken Shenton&#x2019;s line appears to be a normal radiological variant in this age group.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Broken Shenton&#x2019;s lines can be interpreted as a normal radiological variant in this age group, hence, saving on unnecessary further investigations and follow-up.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Patients with developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) may require a pelvic osteotomy to improve acetabular coverage. The purpose of this study was to compare the changes in acetabular version, tilt, and regional coverage angles following the San Diego acetabuloplasty (SDA), the modified San Diego acetabuloplasty (mSDA), using a more anteriorly positioned graft, and the Pemberton acetabuloplasty (PA).</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Fourteen patients with DDH and preoperative computed tomography (CT) imaging were retrospectively identified. From the CTs, 3D reconstructions were created from which two identical pelvises were 3D-printed for each patient (bone was rigid acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), and cartilage was more flexible thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU)). For each model pair, the SDA was performed on one, and the PA was performed on the other. CT scans were obtained before and after the mock acetabuloplasty. Next, the bone graft in the SDA model was moved anteriorly representing the mSDA procedure, and the pelvic model was reimaged. Acetabular version, tilt, and coverage angles in five acetabular octants (posterior, superior-posterior, superior, superior-anterior, and anterior) were calculated. Preoperative to postoperative differences were evaluated with repeated-measures ANOVA or the Wilcoxon signed ranks test, and significance was set to p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Mean age at time of CT was 5.8&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1.2&#x2009;years (range: 3.9&#x2013;7.5&#x2009;years). All three procedures (SDA, mSDA, and PA) significantly increased acetabular tilt (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.045), with a similar change observed for all three (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.868). The PA was the only procedure to significantly decrease relative acetabular version (6.5&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;6.5&#xB0;, preoperative: 12.9&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;5.3&#xB0;; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.004). Both the SDA and mSDA significantly increased coverage in the superior-posterior octant (SDA: 92.6&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;9.3&#xB0;, mSDA: 92.3&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;9.8&#xB0;, preoperative: 81.9&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;9.5&#xB0;; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.02), with a similar percent change among the two (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.0). All three procedures significantly increased superior coverage (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.04); the increase was similar among the three (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.205). The PA was the only procedure to produce a significant increase in coverage in the superior-anterior octant (91.0&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;16.7&#xB0;, preoperative: 74.0&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;12.1&#xB0;; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.005) or the anterior octant (50.7&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;11.7&#xB0;, preoperative: 45.8&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;8.9&#xB0;; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.012).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The SDA and mSDA procedures produced similar postoperative changes primarily in the superior and superior-posterior acetabular octants. Placing the graft more anteriorly did not increase anterior coverage in the mSDA, and only the Pemberton increased acetabular coverage in the superior and superior-anterior acetabular octants.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Surgeons are advised to select the procedure that addresses the particular acetabular deficiency of their patient. The SDA can result in improved posterior-superior coverage, while the PA can result in improved anterior-superior coverage. The anterior mSDA does not improve anterior acetabular coverage.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) is a common hip disorder in adolescents that can result in substantial complications, impacting quality of life. Growth hormone (HGH) administration may elevate the risk of SCFE, although the relationship remains unclear. Clarifying this association could enable better monitoring and earlier diagnosis of SCFE in patients receiving HGH. The aim of the study is to investigate the association between HGH administration and the incidence of SCFE.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> This retrospective cohort study utilized data from the TriNetX research database from January 2003 to December 2022. The study included two cohorts, an HGH cohort including 36,791 patients aged&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;18&#x2009;years receiving growth hormone therapy and a control group consisting of patients who did not receive growth hormone therapy. A 1:1 propensity score matching technique was employed to ensure comparability between the HGH and no-HGH cohorts. The primary outcome measure was the development of SCFE identified by ICD codes. For comparative analysis, both risk ratios (RR) and hazard ratios (HR) were computed to evaluate the association between growth hormone therapy and the development of SCFE.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> The HGH cohort had an increased risk of SCFE compared to the no-HGH cohort (risk ratio: 3.5, 95% CI: 2.073&#x2013;5.909, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) and had an increased hazard of developing SCFE (hazard ratio: 2.627, 95% CI: 1.555&#x2013;4.437, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Patients with higher exposure to HGH (defined as&#x2009;&gt;10 prescriptions) had a risk ratio of 1.914 (95% CI: 1.160&#x2013;3.159, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.010) when compared to their counterparts with&#x2009;&lt;10 prescriptions.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In the largest study to date, HGH administration was associated with an elevated risk of SCFE in children in a dose-dependent manner.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Physicians should remain vigilant in pediatric patients being treated with HGH for the presentation of symptoms associated with SCFE</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> The sphericity deviation score (SDS) is a relatively new continuous hip parameter to describe the femoral head shape after healing in patients with Legg-Calv&#xE9;-Perthes disease (LCPD). This study aims to evaluate the reproducibility of SDS and to explore its association with femoral head sphericity as classified by the modified three-group Stulberg classification.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> From the radiographic archive, we identified 250 LCPD patients who were followed from diagnosis until healing with anteroposterior and frog-leg lateral radiographs. Forty-eight randomized patients were included, and radiographs were provided to six observers with different levels of experience from four different institutions. The observers independently conducted SDS measurements on two occasions, at least 2 weeks apart. We assessed intra- and interobserver agreement using the 95% limits of agreement and defined good agreement when the range was below 40. Reliability was assessed with the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC). ICC values of &lt;0.01 indicate poor reliability; 0.01&#x2013;0.20, slight reliability; 0.21&#x2013;0.40, fair reliability; 0.41&#x2013;0.60, moderate reliability; 0.61&#x2013;0.80, substantial reliability; and more than 0.80, excellent reliability. Mean SDS values of all observers were associated with the modified three group Stulberg classification (round, ovoid, and flat femoral head).</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Only experienced observers demonstrated good intraobserver agreement and excellent intraobserver reliability (Tables 1 and 2). Good agreement and excellent reliability were observed solely between observers conducting the study at the same institution. SDS measurements between lesser experienced observers (Obs 1&#x2013;2) and/or observers from different institutions showed poor interobserver agreement and slight to fair reliability (Tables 1 and 2). There was a significant association between mean SDS values and the femoral head shape (analysis of variance (ANOVA), p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), with mean SDS values of 16.2 (95% confidence interval (CI): 14.1&#x2013;18.3) for round hips (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;23), 24.1 (95% CI: 19.9&#x2013;28.4) for ovoid hips (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;20), and 47.4 (95% CI: 34.1&#x2013;60.1) for flat hips (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;5).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> SDS is a continuous variable which is significantly associated with the modified three-group Stulberg classification to describe the femoral head sphericity. However, it is a time-consuming and complex parameter to apply, and it cannot be reproduced sufficiently between inexperienced observers and/or observers of different institutions.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> The lack of sufficient reproducibility between observers poses a concern about the usefulness of SDS in future research.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> The Pavlik Harness (PH) or Tubingen Hip Flexion Splint (THFS) are commonly used to treat developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH). Dynamic reduction of the hip can be achieved with both methods, although patients require weekly follow-up for the first 3&#x2013;4&#x2009;weeks. However, the success rate for treating severe DDH, such as Graf &#x2162; or &#x2163;, does not always meet expectations. Consequently, many infants may have to endure unnecessary treatment with PH or THFS. In this study, trans-perineal hip ultrasound (TPHUS) is used to detect the relationship between the femoral head and acetabulum during PH or THFS treatment for Graf type III and type IV DDH, to minimize unnecessary interventions.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> From January 2018 to January 2023, we reviewed 118 cases of DDH of Graf types III and IV. The average age was 15&#x2009;weeks (4&#x2013;28&#x2009;weeks), with 83 cases of Graf III and 35 cases of Graf IV. The method of PH or THFS was randomly used, and TPHUS was performed immediately after the application of PH or THFS. The direction of the femoral head was observed as we described in previous study (fig. 1). Patients were followed during the first, second, and third weeks of treatment. Treatment was discontinued if femoral head reduction could not be achieved.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Follow-up duration was 13 (6&#x2013;60)&#x2009;months. Out of the 35 cases with Graf type &#x2163; DDH, immediate ultrasound examination showed that femoral head was directed to acetabular in the PH or THFS in 14 cases (40%). Out of these cases, femoral head was successfully reduced in the third week. However, the direction of femoral head in other cases could not be adjusted to acetabular, leading to unsuccessful reduction. In such cases, the PH or THFS had to be discontinued eventually. For Graf type III, eighty femoral heads in these 83 cases (96.4%) were directed toward the acetabulum and were ultimately reduced.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Transperineal ultrasound examination conducted immediately following conservative treatment is an effective technique for predicting hip reduction in cases of severe developmental dysplasia of the hip treated using PH or THFS. If the orientation of the femoral head is incorrect and cannot be aligned with the acetabulum using these techniques, alternative treatment options should be considered.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Transperineal ultrasound examination conducted immediately following conservative treatment is an effective technique for predicting hip reduction in cases of severe developmental dysplasia of the hip treated using PH or THFS.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Early-onset slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) treated with in-situ fixation have a high risk of significant limb-length discrepancy (LLD) and femoro-acetabular impingement (FAI). Physeal-sparing procedure that stabilizes the physis without fusion is useful in such cases. The aim of this study was to investigate treatment outcomes at skeletal maturity after physeal-sparing procedure for early-onset SCFE.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> We reviewed medical records and radiographs of patients with SCFE at our institution from 1992 to 2022. Patients with early-onset SCFE at age&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;10&#x2009;years and followed up to skeletal maturity were included. Physeal-sparing procedure has been selectively indicated for the treatment of mild to moderate stable SCFE. A long screw with a short-threaded tip was prepared by cutting the end of thread short enough to be mounted only on the epiphysis for the physeal-sparing procedure. Patients were divided into physeal-sparing and in-situ fixation groups according to surgical procedures. Radiographic and clinical outcomes were compared between the two groups: changes in slip angle, LLD, femoral neck length (FNL), articulo-trochanteric distance (ATD), angle alpha, femoral head&#x2013;neck offset (OS), and Harris Hip Score (HHS).</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Fifteen patients underwent physeal-sparing procedure, whereas 15 patients underwent in-situ fixation. There was no further slippage or loss of fixation in either group. Changes in slip angle of physeal-sparing group were significantly larger than those of in-situ fixation group (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001). LLD at maturity of physeal-sparing group was significantly smaller than that of in-situ fixation group (2.0&#x2009;mm versus 21.2&#x2009;mm, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). In physeal-sparing group, there were no significant differences in FNL, ATD, angle alpha, and OS between affected and unaffected sides at the final follow-up. However, in in-situ fixation group, significant decreases in FNL, ATD, and OS and increase in angle alpha were observed on the affected side compared to the unaffected side (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001, and p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001, respectively). The average HHS improved significantly from 58.7 points preoperatively to 89.0 points postoperatively in physeal-sparing group. The main purpose of additional surgeries during the follow-up was the screw change into a longer one because the proximal femoral physis outgrew the screw in physeal-sparing group, whereas LLD and FAI in in-situ fixation group.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Physeal-sparing procedure using a long screw with a short-threaded tip can stabilize the proximal femoral physis. It may also allow the continual growth and remodeling of the proximal femur.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This procedure may benefit to reduce significant LLD and deformation of the proximal femur with FAI in the treatment of early-onset SCFE.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> During the conservative treatment of the unstable development dysplasia of the hip (DDH), after reduction in spica cast (spC), the position of the femoral head is usually checked with CT or MRI. The sonographic technique described by van Douveren (vDT) uses an inguinal approach to detect the position of the femoral head. The aim of this study is to describe the vDT technique and compare it with MRI. The hypothesis is that MRI has more accuracy to detect persistent hip dislocation than vDT.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> In this prospective cross-sectional pilot study, patients treated conservatively with SpC for unstable DDH were enrolled and followed-up until maturation of the hip(s). From 2016 to 2019, 14 consecutive patients (18 hips) treated at a single center were included. The treatment consisted in closed hip reduction and spC. The casting procedure was repeated monthly until unstable hips became stable, both clinically and sonographically. Each time the hips were classified according to Graf, casted and checked with both vDT (immediately after casting) and MRI (within 24&#x2009;h). In this study, an unstable hip is defined as Graf type III and IV, while stable hip are type II or I.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Nine out of 14 patients (12/18 hips) were treated each with 3 SpC, 4/14 (5/18) with 2 SpC; in 1/14 (1/18), the conservative treatment was interrupted after the first spC because the hip was irreducible in a closed fashion. Totally, there were 47 events (vDT and MRI checks) for unstable hips. In 47/47, vDT and MRI showed agreement (Cohen&#x2019;s K&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.0; 100% agreement): there were 46/47 events with reduced hip and 1/47 with dislocated hip. In 1/46 with reduced hip, the vDT showed a persistent hip dislocation in spC; therefore, the reduction and cast procedure was repeated before the MRI; after the second spC both vDT and MRI showed a reduced hip. This was performed to avoid further procedures to the patient, but consequently in this study, nothing can be reported about false positive.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> vDT and MRI showed a perfect agreement (k&#x2009;=&#x2009;1), and the accuracy of MRI was not superior to vDT. As every operator-dependent technique, vDT must be properly performed.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> vDT can be considered as a bed-side technique to check the reduction of the unstable hip in spC.</p>

        <title>Upper retinacular vascular avulsion: a newly described cause of avascularity of the femoral epiphysis in unstable slipped capital femoral epiphysis</title>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Recent data have shown only epiphyseal-unstable slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) is at risk for developing avascular necrosis (AVN). There are several proposed mechanisms for AVN after SCFE, including kinking of vessels, hematoma, and iatrogenic damage. However, the relationship between epiphyseal-instability and epiphyseal vascular perfusion is not well-defined. We therefore sought to characterize how epiphyseal-instability relates to vascular perfusion following SCFE.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> We conducted a retrospective chart review from 2007 to 2022 of all Loder-unstable SCFE treated with closed reduction. Those without both intraoperative dynamic fluoroscopic imaging and postoperative nuclear medicine bone scan (NMBS) were excluded. Epiphyseal-instability was defined as relative motion between the epiphysis and metaphysis on dynamic fluoroscopic imaging. Hematoma evacuation and intraosseous arterial monitoring were performed at the discretion of the attending surgeon. Patient demographics, clinical data, all imaging, and follow-up were recorded.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Of 92 Loder-unstable hips, 13 hips had intraoperative dynamic fluoroscopic imaging and postoperative NMBS. Of these 13 hips, 12 (92%) were determined to be epiphyseal unstable and 1 epiphyseal stable. Median follow-up was 11.9 (range: 1.1&#x2013;34.2)&#x2009;months. The epiphyseal-stable hip had positive radiotracer uptake at 1-month postoperative NMBS and never developed AVN. Of the 12 epiphyseal-unstable hips, 7 (58%) had normal uptake in the affected epiphysis and never developed AVN. The 5 (42%) with reduced uptake postoperatively all developed AVN. Of these five, three had postoperative NMBS 1-month postoperatively. The other two had complete dissociation of the epiphysis from the metaphysis prior to closed reduction and underwent early postoperative NMBS due to high concern for a traumatic vascular injury. These two patients returned to the OR for open surgical management. Both patients were found to have avulsed superior retinacular vessels to the proximal femoral epiphysis along with a completely torn retinaculum.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> More than 40% of epiphyseal-unstable SCFE have reduced perfusion by NMBS following closed reduction and all such patients progress to AVN. Complete dissociation of the epiphysis from the metaphysis on dynamic fluoroscopic imaging is associated with avulsed vasculature from the epiphysis and is an irreversible cause of AVN after SCFE. Epiphyseal-unstable SCFE encompasses a range of damage to the stabilizing soft tissue around the epiphysis which risks tearing epiphyseal vessels themselves.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Besides hematoma, torsion, and iatrogenic damage, which are reversible or preventable causes of AVN, another significant factor contributing to AVN after SCFE is the complete avulsion of superior retinacular vessels. This avulsion represents an irreversible cause of AVN and is underrepresented in the existing literature.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Osteomyelitis of the clavicle is rare, but has a unique presentation, disease course, and treatment. Noninfectious osteomyelitis is an uncommon condition but is relatively more common in the clavicle, with its presence being part of the diagnosis of chronic noninfectious osteomyelitis (CNO), also known as chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO). The purpose of this study was to compare infectious and noninfectious clavicular osteomyelitis in pediatric patients presenting to a tertiary care referral center, while describing a novel radiographic sign.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> This is a retrospective review of a tertiary care referral center from 2008 to 2022 of pediatric patients presenting with lesions of the clavicle. The demographics, radiographic characteristics, laboratory analyses, and treatment course of these patients were reviewed. Patients with radiographs, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and tissue biopsy of the clavicle were included.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> There were 44 patients with MRI and tissue biopsy confirmed clavicular osteomyelitis, with 45% (20/45) diagnosed as noninfectious osteomyelitis. Noninfectious cases were more likely to be female (90% vs 60%) and females were younger (6.0&#x2009;+&#x2009;3.7 vs 11.6&#x2009;+&#x2009;7.4). Less than 10% of noninfectious cases had elevated CRP and ESR. The radiographic features of noninfectious osteomyelitis include medial bony expansion, sclerosis, and chronic remodeling that has the appearance of a platypus (Figure 1). Tissue biopsy shows chronic osteomyelitis with negative cultures.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Noninfectious clavicular osteomyelitis represents a higher proportion of clavicular osteomyelitis cases than osteomyelitis of the long bones. Patients are more likely to be younger and female, with little or no elevation in inflammatory markers. The radiographic appearance shows bony expansion medially in the clavicle, appearing like a platypus. The pediatric orthopedic surgeon should recognize these features of noninfectious osteomyelitis and avoid unnecessary surgical intervention.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Noninfectious clavicular osteomyelitis is often treated with tissue biopsy and/or open-surgical debridement, which is unnecessary. This condition is self-limiting and should be medically managed symptomatically, with most cases responding to NSAIDs. This study serves to improve awareness and diagnosis of this condition by pediatric orthopedic surgeons, while avoiding unnecessary invasive testing.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Rickets, a pediatric condition resulting in defective bone mineralization and deformities, has seen a resurgence in recent years. Children with rickets are prone to fractures and skeletal deformities due to impaired bone development and remodeling. While studies have linked trauma to musculoskeletal infections, the prevalence of septic arthritis and osteomyelitis in rickets patients remains unexplored. Limited case studies have reported the coexistence of rickets and bone and joint infections. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the prevalence of septic arthritis and osteomyelitis in rickets patients compared to a control group, hypothesizing an increased prevalence in rickets patients.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> We performed a retrospective cohort study utilizing the TriNetX Analytics Network, a federated health research network that aggregates de-identified electronic health record data from more than 92 million patients across the United States. We queried pediatric patients with rickets, based on International Classification of Disease, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) encounter diagnoses. Patients in this group with any ICD-10-CM encounter diagnoses of osteomyelitis or septic arthritis were reported. We also established a control cohort to compare the prevalence in patients without rickets by calculating relative risks.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Of 7092 pediatric patients with rickets, 94 (1.33%, 95% CI (confidence interval): 1.06%&#x2013;1.59%) had a history of osteomyelitis and 27 (0.38%, 95% CI: 0.24%&#x2013;0.52%) had a history of septic arthritis. In comparison, of the 16,363,780 patients without rickets, 15,520 (0.09%, 95% CI: 0.09%&#x2013;0.10%) had a diagnosis of osteomyelitis and 7475 (0.05%, 95% CI: 0.04%&#x2013;0.05%) had a diagnosis of septic arthritis. The relative risk for osteomyelitis in pediatric patients with rickets was 13.97 (95% CI: 11.41&#x2013;17.12), while the relative risk for septic arthritis was 8.33 (95% CI: 5.72&#x2013;12.15).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Pediatric patients with rickets have more than 10- and 5-times higher relative risks for developing osteomyelitis and septic arthritis, respectively, compared to those without rickets. This is the first study to explore musculoskeletal infections in rickets patients, highlighting the importance of clinicians being vigilant about these conditions. Further research should determine if changes to diagnostic approaches are needed due to the significantly elevated relative risk.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Due to the ambiguous presentation of musculoskeletal infections, clinicians may overlook the symptoms of patients with rickets as they are predisposed to conditions which mimic osteomyelitis and septic arthritis. Our results illustrate the increased prevalence of these musculoskeletal infections in the rickets population which may warrant greater vigilance by clinicians, modified diagnostic criteria, and lower thresholds for joint aspiration, labs, and advanced imaging in comparison to control populations.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Treatment of acute hematogenous osteomyelitis has recently evolved to a short 2&#x2013;4&#x2009;days intravenous antibiotic treatment before the oral switch. The aim of this preliminary study was to evaluate the possibility of exclusive oral antibiotic treatment in selected pediatric benign osteomyelitis.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> All children treated with exclusive oral antibiotics treatment for a suspicion of uncomplicated osteomyelitis, were prospectively included since 2019. All the patient had to meet the following low-risk criteria: (1) 1&#x2013;4&#x2009;years old, (2) without underlying medical conditions, (3) fever &#x2264;38.5&#xB0;, (4) with a localized bone pain and/or limping, (5) a C-reactive protein (CRP)&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;50&#x2009;mg/L, (6) less than 5&#x2009;days of evolution, and (7) normal X-rays. Complicated osteomyelitis (sub-periosteal or intra-osseous abscess, articular effusion) were excluded. Oral treatment consisted in cefalexin (50&#x2009;mg/kg&#x2009;&#xD7;&#x2009;3 per day) for a total duration of 21&#x2009;days. Diagnosis was confirmed secondarily by bone scintigraphy and/or magnetic resonance imaging. In case of negative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or scintigraphy, antibiotics were stopped. Patients were evaluated at 7 and 21&#x2009;days and at latest follow-up in outpatient clinic visits with a physical examination and a blood test and radiographic controls.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 27 patients met the underlying criteria. Eleven patients (mean age 2.2&#x2009;years) had confirmed acute osteomyelitis (nine by MRI and two by bone scintigraphy). All patients presented with acute limb pain. Mean temperature at presentation was 37.6&#xB0;C, with a mean CRP of 13&#x2009;mg/L. Ten were treated with oral antibiotics for 3&#x2009;weeks and one patient had a proximal tibia pre-abscessed osteomyelitis and was treated for a total of 5&#x2009;weeks. No pathogen was identified in blood culture. No complication was reported at a mean follow-up of 9.3&#x2009;months in any of the 11 confirmed cases.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Exclusive oral antibiotics by cefalexin might be a safe option in selected benign uncomplicated osteomyelitis. However, all the criteria of mildness must be observed, and the patients still required close observation.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Level III prospective case study.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Pediatric orthopedic surgeons must rapidly triage the severity of musculoskeletal infections (MSKIs) to determine which children are at the greatest risk for disease dissemination and adverse outcomes. Diagnostics, such as Kocher criteria, are excellent at predicting the likelihood of an infection. However, few diagnostics predict the severity of an infection. Hence, diagnostics are needed, as they not only predict adverse outcomes but also aid in determining whether a child is improving or declining through serial measurement. The gold standard diagnostic for determining severity is C-reactive protein (CRP). Alternatively, clinicians often use a serum white blood cell (WBC), because of its ubiquitous availability. While useful for predicting infection, WBC is not sensitive to infection severity. Alternatively, the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte-to-platelet ratio (NLR/P) can be obtained readily from a complete blood cell (CBC) with differential, reflecting inflammatory and coagulation pathways in disease. Thus, we hypothesized that, like CRP, the NLR/P is predictive of both infection and disease severity in pediatric MSKI.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective cohort study was conducted at a single tertiary care center for all pediatric orthopedic consultations for MSKI between January 2013 and July 2022. Diagnoses were categorized as MSKI or no infection (e.g. transient synovitis) based on radiographic findings and review of medical records. The degree of infection was stratified based on previously published criteria as no infection, local infection, disseminated infection, or disseminated infection with complications infections. NLR/P was calculated as absolute neutrophil count divided by absolute lymphocyte count divided by platelet count.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> While WBC could indicate whether an infection was present (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.0013), it was unable to differentiate between the levels of severity of infection (p&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;.9999). Alternatively, NLR/P &#xD7;1000 was both capable of determining the presence of an infection (20 vs 7.4, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.0001) and demonstrated non-inferiority to CRP in differentiating between no infection, local infection, disseminated infection, or disseminated infection with complications infections (7.4, 11.7, 26.4, 79.1, respectively, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.0001).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Determining an NLR/P ratio from a CBC is non-inferior to the gold standard of CRP and is useful for identifying both the presence of infection and patients decompensating from MSKI.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> These data are paradigm-shifting regarding the use of a CBC in children with MSKI. While WBC is commonly used by clinicians in the setting of infections, and is a component of the Kocher Criteria, it is ineffective at measuring disease severity. On the contrary, an NLR/P ratio is not only useful in prognosticating the presence of an infection but also stratifying infection severity.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Septic arthritis (SA) and Lyme disease of the knee often have similar presentations, but bacterial SA necessitates urgent surgical treatment. Predictive factors for differentiating SA and other infectious/inflammatory conditions have been published. Our purpose was to test these algorithms using patients from a retrospective multicenter musculoskeletal infection database.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Patients&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;18&#x2009;years old with isolated SA or Lyme disease of the knee were identified. Diagnostic criteria for SA were synovial white blood cell (WBC) count&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;50,000 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, imaging with fluid aspiration suggestive of SA, or joint aspirate/tissue sample that cultured positive for bacteria. Diagnostic criteria for Lyme disease were a positive Lyme titer. Demographics, weight-bearing status, admission vitals, and laboratory tests were collected. Predictive factors from the Baldwin criteria for differentiating knee SA and Lyme disease, and Kocher criteria for differentiating hip SA and transient synovitis were tested.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Around 119 patients with SA and 36 patients with Lyme disease were analyzed. Patients with SA were younger (2.2 vs 8.0&#x2009;years), more likely non-weight-bearing (74% vs 33%), had a higher admission pulse (127 vs 106), and higher admission WBC (12.4 vs 10.2) (all p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). The Baldwin criteria (pain with joint motion, history of fever, C-reactive protein (CRP)&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;40&#x2009;mg/L, age&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;2&#x2009;years) were tested. Pain with joint motion was not collected in our database. Of the remaining factors, the probability of SA with 0 factors was 63% compared with 92% if three factors were present (area under the characteristic curve (AUC) 0.64). The Kocher criteria (non-weight-bearing, temperature&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;101.3&#xB0;F, WBC&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;12.0, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;40&#x2009;mm/h), and CRP&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;20&#x2009;mg/L were also tested. The probability of SA with 0 factors was 41% compared with 96% if all five factors were present (AUC 0.69) (Table). Using data from our patients, regression analysis with backward stepwise elimination determined that age&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;4&#x2009;years, non-weight-bearing, admission WBC&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;13.0, platelets&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;325 &#xD7; 10<sup>9</sup> cells/L, and ESR&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;70 were predictive factors for SA. The probability of SA with 0 factors was 16%, 1 factor was 52%, 2 factors was 86%, 3 factors was 97%, and 4 factors was 100% (AUC 0.86).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our model identified age&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;4&#x2009;years, non-weight-bearing, admission WBC&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;13.0, platelets&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;325, and ESR&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;70 as independent predictive factors for SA of the knee. The more factors present, the higher the likelihood of having SA.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Age&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;4&#x2009;years, non-weight-bearing, admission WBC&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;13.0, platelets&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;325, and ESR&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;70 are independent predictive factors for SA of the knee. The more diagnostic criteria present, the more likely patients have SA versus Lyme disease.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Postoperative infections jeopardize outcomes despite surgical success. We aim to address the knowledge gap of whether neurodivergent children and adolescents (i.e. with diagnoses of autism spectrum disorders, anxiety, depression, personality disorders, etc.) are at increased risk of infection after pediatric orthopedic surgery.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Patients younger than 18&#x2009;years who underwent elective or emergency orthopedic surgeries at two tertiary referral hospitals between 1997 and 2022 were analyzed. Postoperative infections were identified through medical records, positive microbiological culture growth, antibiotic prescriptions, and reoperations. Operations for native musculoskeletal infections, closed reductions without incisions, Botox injections, cast applications, and examination or manipulation under anesthesia were excluded. Neurodivergence was identified through a territory-wide clinical data repository with ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes 291-316. Patient demographics, disease, and microbiological factors were investigated. Analysis was performed by one orthopedic resident, one orthopedic specialist, and one microbiologist. Statistical hypotheses testing through univariable analysis and multivariable regression adjusting for confounding were carried out by a graduate statistician.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Almost 7724 subjects were included in analysis, of which 1577 (20.4%) were neurodivergent, the most common diagnoses being developmental delay (36%), pervasive developmental disorders including autism (12%), and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (11%). Around 353 (179 girls and 174 boys, at mean age of 11.50&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;4.56&#x2009;years) experienced postoperative infections, amounting to a postoperative infection rate of 4.6%. Of these 353 patients, 93 (26%) were neurodivergent. Neurodivergence was a risk factor for postoperative infection (5.9% vs 4.2%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.005). Specifically, infection risk was higher among neurodivergent patients undergoing operations at the spine (11% vs 6%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002), pelvis (15% vs 6%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.012), involving fracture fixation (5% vs 3%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.022), and implants including K-wires (10% vs 6%, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01). Microbiologically, neurodivergent patients were observed to be at higher risk of infection by coagulase-negative <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococci</italic> (2.5% vs 1.4%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002), <italic toggle="yes">Enterococci</italic> (0.4% vs 0.1%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002), and anaerobes (0.2% vs 0.0%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.029). On multivariable binary logistic regression, neurodivergence remained a significant risk factor (adjusted hazards ratio 1.3, 95% CI 1.1&#x2013;1.6, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.035) after adjusting for age, anatomical location, surgery type, and administration of prophylactic antibiotics.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Neurodivergent patients are at increased risk of infection, especially in surgeries involving the spine, pelvis, fracture fixation, and in the presence of implants. Risk of infection by coagulase-negative <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococci, Enterococci</italic>, and anaerobes were higher than in neurotypical patients.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Vigilance against postoperative infections should be higher in neurodivergent pediatric patients undergoing orthopedic surgery. This study provides the basis for further investigation into potential infection-mitigating strategies.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Neuroblastoma is the third most common solid tumor in children. It is estimated that 45%&#x2013;50% of new neuroblastoma patients are characterized as high-risk with a 5-year survival rate of 61% based on Children&#x2019;s Oncology Group&#x2019;s Risk Grouping. The presence of bone metastases in high-risk neuroblastoma may lead to pathologic fractures; however, the risk factors and outcomes are not well described.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Retrospective review of a prospectively collected database of children with high-risk neuroblastoma. High-risk patients without metastatic bone disease were excluded. Patient demographics, data related to pathologic fracture, and disease burden were collected. The disease burden was measured based on the number of bone metastatic sites. Metastasis was categorized by skull, shoulders, ribs/chest, thoracic/lumbar spine, humerus, radius/ulna, pelvis, femur, and tibia/fibula. Metastatic bone disease was recorded as unilateral or bilateral. Sites noted as &#x201C;Unilateral&#x201D; counted as one area of involvement, while bilateral involvement was counted as two. These numbers were then summed to measure the number of areas of osseous metastases. Patients with a pathologic fracture were matched to patients without a fracture based on age, gender, and metastasis to the site of pathologic fracture in a 2:1 ratio. Areas of bone metastases, and if the patient was deceased, were recorded for both control and pathologic fracture cases. We computed significance using a t-test and the Mantel&#x2013;Haenszel method.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 362 patients with neuroblastoma had bone metastases. Eleven patients (3.03%) suffered 16 pathologic fractures after osseous metastases, of which three patients suffered multiple fractures. About 12 of the 16 fractures occurred in long bones (i.e. femur, humerus, tibia/fibula), 7 of which were diaphyseal and 5 were metaphyseal. Operative treatment was necessary for three of the pathologic fractures. There was not a significant relationship between the number of osseous metastases and the risk for pathologic fracture when compared to controls (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.94). Nine of the 11 patients were deceased at the time of the study. There was a significant difference in the proportion of death among patients with a pathologic fracture compared to their matched controls (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Pathologic fractures among patients with neuroblastoma are rare but indicate poor prognosis. Results indicate that an increase in overall presence of metastatic bone disease does not correlate with an increased risk for pathologic fracture.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> No risk factors for pathologic fractures were found, but it is a sign of poor prognosis. Future studies should analyze risk factors related to lesion size and anatomical location.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Multiple hereditary exostoses (MHE) is a genetic disorder affecting approximately 1 in 50,000 individuals. Compression of the peroneal nerve by osteochondromas is documented in the literature. The purpose of this article is to describe indications, complication rate, and revision rate of peroneal nerve decompression in pediatric patients with MHE.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> All patients with a diagnosis of MHE seen at our institution from July 2009 to July 2023 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients who underwent peroneal nerve decompression and were less than 18&#x2009;years of age at the time of surgery were included. Indications, revision rate, location of osteochondromas, and complications were recorded. All patients were included for the indication and complication portion of the review. Patients were excluded from the revision analysis if postoperative follow-up was less than 1&#x2009;year. Logistic regression was performed to determine what factors affected the likelihood of complication or revision.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Fifty-seven patients with 78 limbs were included in the full analysis; 68 limbs were included in the revision analysis. Mean age at the time of surgery was 11.6 (&#xB1;3.5) years. Mean follow-up for the entire cohort was 2.7 (&#xB1;2.1) years. Around 88 operations were performed, and indications are illustrated in Figure 1. There were three patients with preoperative foot drop. One patient with neuropathic pain did not improve after surgery. About 14 of 88 (16%) operations experienced a postoperative complication: 4 foot drop, 3 weakness, 6 neuropathic pain, and 1 wound breakdown. All foot drop improved with observation. All patients with postoperative weakness fully recovered. One limb with wound breakdown and one limb with neuropathic pain required an additional operation. Logistic regression demonstrated excision of an anterior osteochondroma (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0030) as a significant predictor of complication with an odds ratio of 6.4 (CI 1.9&#x2013;21.8). Almost 10 of 68 (14.7%) limbs required revision peroneal nerve decompression. Logistic regression demonstrated age at the time of surgery (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0474) to be a significant factor for revision with an odds ratio of 0.8 (CI: 0.64&#x2013;1.0).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Common indications for peroneal nerve decompression include pain, weakness, and a positive Tinel&#x2019;s sign. Our experience demonstrated a 16% complication rate; however, most improved without further operative intervention. Anterior fibular osteochondroma excision appears to increase the probability of complication. Performing decompressions at a later age may mitigate the need for revision surgery.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This is the first study to look at a large, single-center experience of peroneal nerve decompressions exclusively in pediatric patients with MHE.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Hip joint septic arthritis is a pediatric orthopedic emergency that requires urgent clinical work up, diagnosis, and management. An essential step in confirming diagnosis is joint synovial fluid aspiration. Traditionally, hip aspirations are performed in the operating room (OR) or with the assistance of interventional radiology (IR). However, expeditious care via these pathways is frequently limited by IR personnel or OR availability. Therefore, our orthopedic residents began performing ultrasound-guided bedside aspirations in the emergency department. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of this practice on time to diagnosis and definitive treatment of septic arthritis of the hip. We hypothesized that bedside aspiration would decrease time to diagnosis, operative time, and number of patients taken to the OR who did not require formal debridement.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> This is a retrospective study of patients who presented to our pediatric orthopedic tertiary care emergency room and required a hip aspiration to rule out septic arthritis between 2003 and 2023. Patient demographics, Kocher criteria values, time to aspiration, and final treatment are presented. Kruskal&#x2013;Wallis and Fisher&#x2019;s exact tests were used to compare demographic and clinical differences in RStudio using a two-sided level of significance of 0.05.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Hip aspiration was performed to rule out septic arthritis in 57 patients (average age 6.0&#x2009;years; 58% female). Time to obtaining joint fluid was significantly shorter for patients undergoing bedside or IR-guided aspiration compared to OR aspiration (7.6 hours vs 5.3 hours vs 15.07 hours, respectively). Time from presentation to OR for open surgical debridement, total operative time, and the percentage of patients requiring open surgical debridement did not significantly differ between groups. There was no significant difference between groups regarding duration of symptoms or Kocher criteria values.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Bedside hip aspiration by on-call orthopedic residents provides an expedited method to diagnose septic hips in the emergency room and decreases the number of patients needing to be taken to the OR if IR aspiration is unavailable. Bedside ultrasound machines are readily available in the emergency room, and the technique is safe and can be easily taught to junior on-call residents.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Ultrasound-guided hip aspirations performed by orthopedic residents decreases the time to diagnosis while simultaneously decreasing the burden on the overall health system by not relying on other subspecialties to perform the aspiration and avoiding unnecessary trips to the OR.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Operative orthopedic oncology surgical cases including the biopsy tract with primary resections may limit operative options, potentially contributing to higher morbidity. This study aims to explore the resection of biopsy tracts during a separate procedure from the primary wide-tumor resection specimen and the implications this may have on local recurrence of the resected tumor and overall survival.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> This is a retrospective single-center study from 2014 to 2023. A total of 45 pediatric sarcoma cases were included with diagnoses of osteosarcoma (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;30), Ewing sarcoma (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;11), and other primary bone sarcomas (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;4). Of these, the biopsy tract was resected separately from the main specimen in 24 (53%) cases.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> We noted a total local recurrence of 8.9% pediatric bone sarcomas. For cases with separate biopsy resection, 4.2% (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;1) demonstrated evidence of disease in the separate biopsy tract specimen. Separate resection of the biopsy tract did not affect the rate of local recurrence (OR 0.88, 95% CI: 0.11, 6.77, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.90). There was no association between local recurrence and open versus core-needle biopsy (OR 0.28, 95% CI: 0.35, 2.29, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.24). Positive margins in the primary resected specimen (17.8% of cases) was an independent risk factor for the development of local recurrence.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> There was no increased risk of local recurrence in cases where the biopsy tract was resected separately compared to cases where it was resected with the main tumor. Positive margins in the primary resection specimen was the greatest predictor of local recurrence, so optimizing the surgical approach and resection strategy to best ensure negative margins is paramount.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Risk of local recurrence is dependent on margins on the primary resection specimen and not affected by separate biopsy tract resection from the primary tumor.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Chronic osteomyelitis is a major surgical challenge in orthopedics. In children, this challenge is exacerbated by smaller bone stock, risk of growth arrest, chronic state of toxemia which may threaten the general condition of the child, in addition to lack of a single surgical solution to eradicate the infection. Antibiotic-loaded calcium sulfate has been used with promising results; we report our experience in treating these cases, in 65 children.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Sixty-five children were included in this study, they were divided into two groups; Group 1 includes 34 children who were treated by surgical debridement, guttering, and curettage with application of vancomycin-loaded calcium sulfate STIMULAN&#xD2;, while group 2 includes cases who were treated without application of vancomycin-loaded calcium sulfate. Mean age was 12&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;5 and 11.5&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;3.5&#x2009;years for group 1 and 2, respectively. Mean follow-up for all cases was 24&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;4&#x2009;months. Infection was in the tibia in 27 cases, in the femur in 19 cases, in the humerus in 9 cases, in calcaneus in 6 cases and metacarpal in 4 cases. Parenteral administration of antibiotics till the CRP is lowered to half of the base line value, then oral administration of oral antibiotics till normalization of CRP.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Group 1: Discharge has stopped in 30 out of 34 cases, in 4 cases; 11.7%; additional surgical debridement was performed at an average of 17th week due to exacerbation of infection. Complete bone integration of the substitute was achieved in 28 cases, within a mean time of 14&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;3&#x2009;weeks. In six cases, additional bone grafting from iliac crest was performed after clearance of infection. Full weight-bearing was allowed after complete integration of bone in plain radiographs. At the final follow-up, two cases had recurrent exacerbation after the second debridement. Group 2: Discharge has stopped in 23 out of 31 cases, in eight cases; 25%. Second surgical debridement was performed at an average of 14th week. Third debridement was performed in five cases; at an average of 31st weeks after the first surgery. At the final follow-up, four cases had recurrent exacerbation after the third debridement.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Surgical debridement with administration of vancomycin-loaded calcium sulfate, along with administration of antibiotics provide a significantly better surgical solution for treatment of chronic osteomyelitis in children.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Local application of vancomycin-loaded calcium sulfate with surgical debridement can improve the surgical results of treating chronic osteomyelitis in children</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Aneurysmal bone cysts (ABCs) are relatively rare bone tumors in children. Although pathologically benign, their expansile nature makes these lesions challenging to treat. We conducted a retrospective multicenter study to evaluate whether factors such as lesion site, stage (Enneking), tumor volume, and radiological healing response (Capanna) affected the onset and displacement of pathological fractures during the initial presentation and follow-up of patients treated with curettage and grafting.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> The study included 88 children with ABCs who were treated with curettage and grafting in 6 tertiary care centers. We recorded the patients&#x2019; demographics, lesion characteristics, early and late complications, and 5- to 8-year survival rates, with recurrence and pathological fracture as the endpoints.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> The participants&#x2019; mean age was 9.9 (range: 2&#x2013;17)&#x2009;years, and the mean follow-up was 43.9 (range: 6&#x2013;112)&#x2009;months. The femur (36.4%), tibia (27.3%), and humerus (12.5%) were the most frequently involved bones; 54.5% of the lesions were limited to the metaphysis, 23.9% included the metaphysis and diaphysis, and 11.4% spanned the epiphysis and metaphysis. The mean tumor volume was 92.4 (range: 0.3&#x2013;627.2)&#x2009;cm<sup>3</sup>. Twenty-five patient (28.4%) had pathological fractures at the initial presentation, and 5 patients (5.7%) had pathological fractures during the follow-up. The rate of index fracture was 75.0% for the radius, 72.7% for the humerus, 28.1% for the femur, 16.7% for the pelvis, and 8.3% for the tibia (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001). The fracture rate during follow-up was 25% for the radius, 9.1% for the humerus and 9.4% for the femur (p&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.05). When fractures occurred, they were displaced more than 2 mm in 50% and 27.3% of the cases in the radius and humerus, respectively (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.005). Tumor size, location (epiphysis/metaphysis/diaphysis), Enneking stage, and Capanna grade had no effect on the pathological fractures during follow-up. The presence of a pathological fracture during presentation increased the risk of early and late complications (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001). The 5- and 8-year survival rate was 92.4% and 73.9%, respectively.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The ABC location is the main factor affecting the onset of pathological fractures during the initial presentation. The upper extremity bones have the highest rate of fracture, even though lesions in the femur and tibia are under constant stress during weight-bearing. Patients with lesions in the non-weight-bearing bones might be asymptomatic until late stages of the disease, increasing the risk of unsuspected fracture in a child.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Curettage and grafting of ABC is a successful treatment method with high survival and low re-fracture and recurrence rates. Tumor location is the main factor for complications following surgery.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Current treatment of rotational deformities of long bones in children is osteotomies and fixation. In recent years, the use of guided growth for correction of rotational deformities has been reported in several pre-clinical and clinical studies. Various techniques have been used and different adverse effects, like growth retardation, articular deformities, and rebound effect have been reported. We have tested a novel plate concept (RotOs Plate TM) intended for correction of rotational deformities of long bones by guided growth, with sliding screw holes to allow for longitudinal growth, in a porcine model.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Twelve, 12-week-old female porcines were included in the study. Mean weight at insertion of the plates was 42 (38&#x2013;45)&#x2009;kg, mean duration of intervention was 88 (83&#x2013;98)&#x2009;days, and mean weight at plate removal was 85 (80&#x2013;94)&#x2009;kg. Surgery was performed in the left femur while the right femur was used as control. Plates were placed on the lateral and medial side of the distal femur, spanning the growth plate, in an orientation meant to induce external rotation, as longitudinal growth occurred. Computed tomography (CT)-scans and X-rays were performed at plate insertion and removal. From the CT-scans, 3D-models of the left and right femur were made and used for measuring the achieved rotation.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> The plates rotated as intended in all 12 porcines. One porcine was excluded due to congenital deformity of the proximal part of the femurs. In 2 of the 12 porcines, there was cut-out of the proximal screw on the lateral side, observed at the end of the intervention. These two porcines were included in the results. The untreated femurs exhibited a slight inward rotation 2.81&#xB0;&#xB1;&#x2009;2.00&#xB0;, while the treated femurs exhibited &#x2013;3.97&#xB0;&#xB1;&#x2009;3.81 of external rotation. The mean difference was thus 6.8&#xB0; (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002) of rotation. Further analyses of potential side effects (malalignment in other planes) will be presented.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The plate worked as intended and significant external rotation was achieved. Additional analysis of the data with regards to possible adverse effects like limb length discrepancy, angular and articular deformities and rebound effect is ongoing.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> While the use of guided growth for correction of rotational deformities is already being used clinically, it is still to be considered an experimental procedure with sparse evidence. This study shows promising results for the feasibility of the method in a large animal model and is an important first step in validating the technique and detecting possible adverse effects, before future clinical studies.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Angular deformity is a common cause for parental concern. In order to address their deformity using guided growth techniques, it is important to be able to estimate the anticipated correction so intervention can be appropriately timed. We aimed to present our experience in a large population to assess efficacy of guided growth in addressing angular deformity. As a secondary aim, we wanted to use angular correction equations to assess their accuracy compared to the results we observed.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> We retrospectively reviewed the charts of patients who underwent intervention to address an angular deformity. We looked at age, sex, underlying diagnosis, type of deformity, affected bone, length of bone, initial deformity, date of surgery, and deformity at each subsequent follow-up. All patients were treated by the same two pediatric fellowship-trained attendings. We then used multiplier equation and Menelaus equation to predict our correction and compared them to our observed correction.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> We identified 164 limbs seen between 2006 and 2017 who underwent hemi-epiphysiodesis for coronal deformity. The femur was involved in 63 patients and the tibia in 101 patients. The average age of patients at time of surgery was 11&#x2009;+&#x2009;3. The average final correction was 6.84&#xB0;, average yearly angular correction was 5.8&#xB0;, and average monthly correction was 0.48&#xB0;. Our sick physis group had an average correction of 7.1&#xB0; with an average yearly angular correction of 5.6&#xB0; and average monthly correction of 0.47&#xB0;. Our idiopathic group had an average correction of 6.4&#xB0; with an average yearly angular correction during treatment 6.1&#xB0;, and an average monthly correction was 0.51&#xB0;. Our idiopathic tibial group had an average correction of 5.4&#xB0;. The idiopathic femoral deformity group had an average correction of 7.9&#xB0;.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> We observed adequate correction in both idiopathic and &#x201C;sick&#x201D; physes groups. Predictive models were applicable, though they did tend to overestimate correction. All groups correlated better with the Menelaus method. As expected, given a more predictable physis, the idiopathic group correction was closer to both estimates. We confirm that guided growth remains a successful tool and that predictive models can be useful in guiding patient follow-up and treatment.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Angular deformity about the knee can present a challenge in timing of treatment. This study is one of the largest groups looking at angular deformity and demonstrates the potential for using predictive models to time intervention.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Reimbursement for services rendered by physicians is determined by a computation of the relative value unit (RVU) associated with CPT codes. It is based on the amount of work required to provide a service, the resources available, and the level of expertise involved. Because limb reconstruction surgeons often are among the lowest RVU generators in their practice group, we wanted to evaluate whether the RVU values were comparable across different orthopedic subspecialties. Consequently, this study compares the documented RVU totals of three common pediatric orthopedic surgeries, arthroscopic ACL reconstruction, spinal fusion for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis and antegrade femoral intramedullary limb lengthening (IMLL).</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> This was an Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved, multicenter, retrospective chart review. Charts of subjects who had ACL reconstructions, including meniscal repairs; spinal fusion surgeries for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (7&#x2013;12 levels), including Ponte osteotomies; and femoral antegrade internal limb lengthening procedures, each completed by fellowship-trained pediatric orthopedic surgeons were reviewed. Comparisons were carried out between several parameters, including the mean duration of each procedure, the number of CPT codes associated with each procedure, the number of post-operative visits in the 90-day global period, and the computed wRVU for each procedure.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Around 50 charts (25 from each center) for each procedure were reviewed. The results are summarized in the table and figure below. The RVU per hour was significantly lowest in the antegrade femur lengthening group (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001). The number of post-op visits in the 90-day global post-surgery period were significantly higher in the antegrade femur lengthening group (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> RVUs per time are statistically significantly lowest in the limb lengthening group and highest in the scoliosis group. The limb lengthening patient also requires significantly more visits and time in the post-operative period compared to the other groups. These extra visits during the global period do not add any RVU value to the lengthening surgeon and occupy clinic spots that could be filled with new patients. Based on these data, a review of the RVU values assigned to the limb lengthening codes may be necessary.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This study clearly demonstrates that there is a large discrepancy in wRVU per hour between these three surgeries. For pediatric deformity surgeons, this can potentially lead to lower incomes, less leadership opportunities if RVU productivity is taken into consideration and possibly burnout.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> We hope to better understand patient and family preferences in treatment decision-making for congenital femoral deficiency (CFD), specifically the importance of treatment features and the most and least difficult aspects of decision-making.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> We surveyed patients (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;52), parents (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;135), and clinicians (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;55). Patients/parents were identified from a multicenter, pediatric orthopedic hospital system. Clinicians were identified using professional societies/networks. Surveys were administered online and included a discrete choice experiment (DCE) to measure various treatment features that influence decision-making and a best-worst scaling (BWS) experiment to measure the most/least difficult aspects of treatment decision-making. To analyze the DCE and BWS, we calculated the weight of feature importance and preference shares. We also assessed risk tolerance, role preferences for shared decision-making, clinical characteristics, and demographic information.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Patients and parents ordered the importance of treatment features similarly. The treatment feature that carried the most weight was mobility outcomes. The three next features were weighted similarly and included avoiding amputation, number of surgeries, and chance of serious complications. The least-weighted feature was the number of follow-up appointments; however, parents weighted this more heavily than patients (11.1% vs 4.8%). Clinicians placed much greater weight on mobility relative to other treatment features; the weight for mobility (47.5%) was more than double the weight of the next most important treatment feature (chance of serious complications; 19.0%). For clinicians, less weight was assigned to avoiding amputation (11.0%) than for families (23.3%, 21.7%). Preference shares for sources of decisional conflict varied across groups (Figure 1). For patients, lack of information about conditions and treatments was the most difficult aspect of decision-making, whereas, for parents, it was the permanency of the decision. Clinicians believed that the most difficult aspect of decision-making for families would be weighing the tradeoffs of treatment options (42.0%), but families did not consider this one of the more important sources of difficulty (9.1%, 9.3%).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This study highlights key treatment priorities and decision-making factors in CFD from the perspectives of patients, parents, and clinicians. Patients and parents prioritize mobility outcomes, while clinicians place greater emphasis on mobility and less on avoiding amputation. Variances in sources of decisional conflict across groups underscore the need for enhanced informational resources and decision-making aids.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> These findings emphasize the importance of a patient-centered approach to shared decision-making and the development of patient decision aids to align treatment strategies with patient and family values in CFD treatment planning.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Motorized intramedullary lengthening nails (MILNs) have become increasingly popular for the treatment of lower limb length discrepancy (LLD). Recently developed MILNs function through distraction osteogenesis to grow regenerate. As such, they rely on accuracy of distraction parameters to achieve timely consolidation. According to the trauma literature, factors such as age, infection, and degree of lengthening have been implicated in delayed consolidation. Studies describe reamed intramedullary nailing as attenuating rates of nonunion and malunion, versus un-reamed nailing. No literature exists, however, assessing the degree of canal reaming as it relates to delayed consolidation in LLD.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Clinical records of 179 patients (145 femurs and 85 tibias) who had undergone lengthening for LLD between 2014 and 2021 were reviewed. Analysis was performed on cases meeting the following eligibility criteria: patients with follow-up of &gt;12&#x2009;months, those who received treatment with an MILN through a piriformis or trochanteric approach (femur) or via suprapatellar or infrapatellar entry (tibia), as well as records which noted reamer size. Degree of canal reamed was calculated by the proportion of reamer size to canal, given as a percentage, and separated into three groups (&lt;80%, 80%&#x2013;120%, and &gt;120%). These were matched to instances of delayed consolidation to determine significance. A subgroup analysis was also conducted by age, gender, body mass index (BMI), and weight.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Overall mean percentage of canal reamed was 95.6% (femur) and 94% (tibia), with a mean consolidation index of 52.4 and 164, respectively. Fifty-five femurs (37%) and 47 tibias (55%) developed delayed consolidation (more than 6 months) with 15% (femurs) and 7% (tibias) requiring return to the operating room (OR). Neither percentage of canal reamed, nor age, weight, BMI, or gender demonstrated statistically significant bearing on consolidation time.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Delayed consolidation after distraction osteogenesis for LLD presents a challenge for patients and surgeons alike. Our findings revealed no statistically significant impact on delayed consolidation associated with the degree of reaming prior to MILN insertion.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> The existing literature has suggested that reamed intramedullary nailing may attenuate rates of nonunion and malunion, versus un-reamed nailing. Previously, however, no research had evaluated the impact of the degree of canal reaming prior to MILN insertion on delayed consolidation in LLD. The retrospective analysis herein revealed no statistical significance between the two factors, presenting encouraging, provocative data which could bolster understanding in the field, and which clearly warrants further investigation in a larger sample size.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Coronal plane deformity is a well-known feature of multiple hereditary exostoses (MHE). Although prior reports have demonstrated successful treatment with hemi-epiphysiodesis, details regarding correction rate and comparison to an idiopathic population are lacking. This study aimed to detail our institution&#x2019;s experience with guided growth about the knee in patients with MHE and compare this to an idiopathic population.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> All pediatric patients (age&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;18&#x2009;years) with MHE who underwent lower extremity hemi-epiphysiodesis at a tertiary care medical center between 1/2016 and 12/2022 were retrospectively reviewed. Pre- and post-operative mechanical lateral distal femoral angle (mLDFA) and medial proximal tibial angle (MPTA, the primary outcomes) were measured in addition to mechanical axis deviation (MAD) and hip-knee-ankle angle (HKA). Patients were 1:2 matched based on age, sex, varus, or valgus deformity, and physes instrumented to a cohort with idiopathic coronal plane malalignment.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> About 31 extremities in 20 patients with MHE underwent hemi-epiphysiodesis of the distal femur, proximal tibia, and/or distal tibia. Mean age at surgery was 11.6&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;2.4&#x2009;years. For all patients with MHE, HKA corrected a mean 0.31&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;0.31&#xB0;/month for distal femur, 0.24&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;0.24&#xB0;/month for proximal tibia, and 0.87&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;0.54&#xB0;/month for combined distal femur and proximal tibia-guided growth. There were no differences in correction rates per month for mLDFA (0.52&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;0.33&#xB0; vs 0.51&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;0.32&#xB0;, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.857) or MPTA (0.31&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;0.22&#xB0; vs 0.48&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;0.49&#xB0;, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.136) between MHE and idiopathic groups. For 12 extremities in the MHE group with open physes at hardware removal, they experienced a mean recurrence of HKA of 3.33&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;4.01&#xB0; at 20-month follow-up.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Hemiepiphysiodesis corrects lower extremity malalignment in patients with MHE at a similar rate compared to an idiopathic coronal plane deformity population.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Rebound deformity of 3&#xB0; 20&#x2009;months after hardware removal in MHE patients with remaining open growth plates should make surgeons conscious of remaining growth potential when planning deformity correction.</p>

        <title>Infantile Blount disease and overweight in Ghana</title>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Blount disease is characterized by a growth arrest and disturbed endochondral ossification of the posteromedial part of the proximal tibia. This results in genu varum, internal rotation, and procurvatum. Three different forms of the condition are described, based on the age of onset of the condition. Infantile, or early onset, starts before the age of 4&#x2009;years, juvenile onset starts between the age of 4 and 10&#x2009;years and adolescent or late onset starts after the age of 10&#x2009;years. Although several hypotheses exist, the etiology of Blount disease remains unknown. The best-founded hypothesis for the development of Blount disease is the &#x201C;increased mechanical force hypothesis.&#x201D; There is evidence for a relationship between obesity and Blount disease, although, most studies supporting this are conducted in high-income countries, mostly the United States. However, unlike in the western population that was studied to establish this hypothesis, Blount disease is relatively common in African countries and obesity is not.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> After reviewing patient files and conventional Roentgenologic imaging, 96 patients with infantile Blount disease seen in a rural hospital in Ghana (2012&#x2013;2021) were included. Demographic information was collected form patient files. Body weight and height at first and follow-up consultations were collected. The World Health Organization (WHO) weight-for-age growth standard was used. Overweight was defined as a percentile between 85th and 97th. Obese as a percentile between 97th and 99th. Above the 99th percentile was defined as severely obese.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> The mean age at presentation was 6&#x2009;years and 3&#x2009;months (&#xB1;3&#x2009;years and 4&#x2009;months). This was not different between boys (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;27) and girls (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;69). The mean weight for age percentile in our population was 56.8th (&#xB1;35.3) (Boys: 54.1th (&#xB1;38.2), girls: 57.9th (&#xB1;34.3). In our total study population, 68% was of normal weight, 14% overweight, 9% obese, and 9% severely obese.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The most researched hypothesis for the etiology of Blount disease is an increased mechanical force because of obesity. This study shows that almost 70% of patients with infantile Blount disease in Ghana have a normal weight, and 18% is obese or severely obese. This is in great contrast with the literature, showing about 90% of the infantile Blount patients are obese or severely obese.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This study is one of the few more recent studies on Blount disease in Africa, including almost a hundred patients. The results of this study change the paradigm about obesity as the leading factor of Blount disease.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> LIMB-Q Kids is a new patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) for children with lower limb differences (LLDs). The objective of this study was to conduct an international field test study.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A mixed-method multiphase approach was used to develop LIMB-Q Kids. In phase 1, a systematic review was conducted to identify concepts from existing PROMs. A preliminary conceptual framework derived from the systematic review informed an international qualitative study conducted at sites in Canada, Ethiopia, India, and the United States. The data from qualitative interviews were used to develop items for the LIMB-Q Kids, which were further refined through multiple rounds of cognitive debriefing interviews (CDIs) with children. Input was also obtained from parents and healthcare professionals from Australia, Canada, Ethiopia, India, United Kingdom, and the United States. LIMB-Q Kids was translated and culturally adapted (TCA) into multiple languages following the guidelines from The Professional Society for Health Economics and Outcomes Research.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> The field-test version of LIMB-Q Kids consists of 11 scales (159 items) that measure appearance, physical function, symptoms (hip, knee, ankle, foot, and leg), leg-related distress, and school, social, and psychological function. This version was translated into Danish, Finnish, German, and Hindi. Translations that are in progress include Arabic, Dutch, Portuguese, Spanish, and Hebrew. An international field-test study is underway in 7 countries (15 sites). To date, 678 patients from 15 sites have completed LIMB-Q Kids. Around 535 participants have completed LIMB-Q Kids, PROMIS physical function items and PedsQL at the same time. These data will be used to validate LIMB-Q Kids with previously established PROMs. About 85 participants have done LIMB-Q Kids twice at a 2-week interval for the test re-test reliability analysis. A preliminary analysis of the available data using Rasch Measurement Theory analysis provided evidence that the scales in the LIMB-Q Kids work as hypothesized.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> There is currently no rigorously developed and internationally applicable PROM for children with LLDs. The data from the field test study will be used to perform Rasch analysis to reduce the number of items in the scales, examine their psychometric performance (reliability, validity), and develop scoring algorithms.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Once completed, the LIMB-Q Kids will provide a common metric for outcome assessment for children with LLDs internationally. The modular nature of LIMB-Q Kids will offer the flexibility of selecting the scales based on the clinical and research needs. This will be an important aspect in reducing the patient burden for completing PROMs.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Tibial hemimelia is a rare condition that ranges from subtle aplasia of the tibia or complete absence of the tibia. The most severe type of tibial hemimelia is complete absence of the tibia. The purpose of this article is to review results of limb reconstruction in patients with complete absence of the tibia with a minimum 4-year follow-up.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective review was performed of all patients with tibial hemimelia. Patients were included if they had complete absence of the tibia and underwent limb reconstruction. Patients were excluded if follow-up was less than 4 years. Included limbs were divided into two groups: those with a patella and those without. Clinical data, surgeries, and complications were recorded. Analysis was performed with an independent t-test and Wilcoxon rank sum test. Fisher&#x2019;s exact test was used to compare knee outcomes.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Twenty-nine patients with 36 limbs were included. The median age at the initial surgery was 2.1 (IQR 2.6)&#x2009;years. The mean follow-up was 8.4 (&#xB1;3.0)&#x2009;years. Sixteen limbs had patellas and 20 did not. The median preoperative knee flexion deformity was 45&#xB0; (IQR 46.3&#xB0;); there was no difference between the groups (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.5748). The median preoperative predicted limb length discrepancy 9.0 (IQR: 12.4)&#x2009;cm and no difference between types (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.2274). The mean number of surgeries was 7 (&#xB1;2.8), complications 5.6 (&#xB1;2.9) and complications requiring operative intervention 2.8 (&#xB1;1.8), and there were no differences between the types. Figure 1 illustrates the final knee outcome; there was no difference between the groups (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.4205). All ankles were fused. In limbs with knee motion, the mean knee flexion deformity was 6.0&#xB0; (&#xB1;8.0&#xB0;) and mean knee range of motion was 48.1&#xB0; (&#xB1;34.5&#xB0;), and there was no difference between the groups (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.269, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.981). About 14 of 19 limbs that had knee motion required a KAFO or HKAFO to ambulate. All but two patients were able to ambulate following reconstruction.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> A mobile &#x201C;knee&#x201D; was created in approximately 50% of limbs in the study. Another 31% were salvaged with a knee fusion. Surgical reconstruction requires multiple planned surgeries and some unplanned interventions. All but two patients, regardless of the most recent treatment, were able to ambulate.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This is the largest, single-center study to describe mid-term results of limb reconstruction in tibial hemimelia with a completely absent tibia. These data can help surgeons set expectations for patients undergoing reconstruction.</p>

        <title>Magnetic intramedullary lengthening nails can be lengthened to their maximum with no increase in nail failure</title>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Magnetic intramedullary lengthening nails (MILNs) have become an increasingly popular method for long-bone distraction osteogenesis, to overcome the limitations of bone lengthening with an external fixator, which could include the inconvenience of a bulky external device, discomfort, and the risk of pin-site infection. These devices may introduce other complications, however, such as muscle contractures, hardware failures, and local adverse tissue reactions. While factors like nail diameter, nail alignment, and various mechanical characteristics have been associated with an increased risk of nail breakage, the relationship between the percentage of maximal lengthening achieved, and the incidence of nail breakage, remains unexplored. We specifically assessed overall complications in (1) in the absence of contractures and (2) contractures by amount of distraction (25%&#x2013;60%, 61%&#x2013;90%, and 91%&#x2013;100%).</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> We retrospectively reviewed 176 pediatric and 109 adult patients who underwent limb lengthening with at least 12&#x2009;months of follow-up. Cohorts were divided based on amount of distraction: 25%&#x2013;60% (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;75), 61%&#x2013;90% (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;72, and 91%&#x2013;100% (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;29) in children, and 25%&#x2013;60% (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;30), 61%&#x2013;90% (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;29), and 91%&#x2013;100% (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;50) in adults. Complications included: contractures, lost length, fracture, axial deviation, and nail, lengthening, rod, and screw failures. All lengthening and alignment parameters were assessed radiographically.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Without contractures, complication rates were similar among the pediatric cohorts as stratified by distraction level (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.07): 61%&#x2013;90% (12.5%), 25%&#x2013;60% (2.7%), and 91%&#x2013;100% (6.9%). With contractures, complication rates were greatest in the 61%&#x2013;90% cohort (49.0%), followed by the 91%&#x2013;100% cohort (34.5%) and the 25%&#x2013;60% cohort (25.3%) (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01). The adult population outcomes followed a similar trend, with complication rates for patients without contractures showing little variation among groups. Likewise, complications with contractures were greatest for adults in the 91%&#x2013;100% (52%) distraction cohort, followed by 61%&#x2013;90% (44.8%), and 25%&#x2013;60% (13.3%) (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.002). All but six contractures in adults resolved with surgery while all but of the contractures resolved with surgery in the pediatric population.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This is the first study to explore the relationship between percentage of nail lengthening and nail complications. The concern that full extension of the nail may lead to increased nail failure (bending or breaking) was not consistent with our findings. Contractures notwithstanding, complication rates were similar regardless of the amount of distraction applied. Interestingly, however, we found a greater amount of distraction was associated with more contractures and loss of ROM in our cohorts.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This result has important clinical relevance in guiding the surgeon to minimize the number of postoperative complications in select patients.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> When a baby is born with lower limb deficiencies (LLD) of any type, a lifetime of functional limitations is predicted. It is common practice to calculate predicted adult LLD and plan surgical options accordingly. Rarely, conservative treatment is chosen, meaning the child will mobilize with length equalization&#x2014;either shoe lift, or a personally fitted extension-prosthesis if the LLD is more than 4&#x2009;cm. To date, only limited research describes the long-term implications of LLD and use of extension-prosthesis. This presents a challenge when discussing prognoses with newly diagnosed patients&#x2019; families. The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term QoL and functional capabilities of adults with LLD mobilizing with an extension-prosthesis.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> We retrospectively reviewed medical records of patients aged 18&#x2009;years and older who were prescribed an extension-prosthesis between 2000 and 2020. Data included demographics, medical diagnoses, surgeries, and prosthetic prescriptions. Prospective telephone interviews were conducted, including data on living conditions, family status, education and employment, prosthetic use and mobility, pain, participation, prosthesis evaluation questionnaire (PEQ), and SF-12. Descriptive statistics were used to calculate means, standard deviations (SD), medians, and frequencies of all relevant variables.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Eighty-five patients met inclusion criteria; 3 died by the time of interviews; 36 replied (44%). About 26 males (72%); mean age 51.36 (SD&#x2009;=&#x2009;15.90). All but one patient currently uses their extension-prosthesis. Fifty-five percent reported having surgery of the affected lower limb. Around 61% report having pain, mainly in the lower back. All live independently; 18 (50%) are married, mean length of marriage 25.17&#x2009;years (SD&#x2009;=&#x2009;13.87); and mean number of children 3.41 (SD&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.69). Almost 90% completed high school or some level of post-secondary education. Fifty-five percent employed. Body mass index (BMI) is normal to somewhat high for age, mean 25.35 (SD&#x2009;=&#x2009;5.48). Ambulation is limited, although more than half report walking independently indoors. Most described themselves as physically active in sports, now or in the past. All need some assistance in ADL. Mean independence outcome was 16.31 (SD&#x2009;=&#x2009;3.3). With regard to QoL SF12 (range&#x2009;=&#x2009;0&#x2013;100), mean Physical (PCS) was 53.92 (SD&#x2009;=&#x2009;29.36), and mean Mental MCS was 70.96 (SD&#x2009;=&#x2009;23.38) (higher scores indicate better function). Short PEQ (range&#x2009;=&#x2009;0&#x2013;100) mean sub scores were Satisfaction&#x2009;=&#x2009;74.29 (SD&#x2009;=&#x2009;24.41), Utility&#x2009;=&#x2009;68.31 (SD&#x2009;=&#x2009;16.6), Appearance&#x2009;=&#x2009;57.1 (SD&#x2009;=&#x2009;14.56), Residual limb health&#x2009;=&#x2009;68.12 (SD&#x2009;=&#x2009;15.58), Ambulation&#x2009;=&#x2009;59.23 (SD&#x2009;=&#x2009;21.82), and Transfer&#x2009;=&#x2009;68.9 (SD&#x2009;=&#x2009;22.0).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The study results include key data toward providing more informed patient education and decision-making on preferred treatment recommendations when the patients are at a crossroad concerning the selection of treatment options.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Helping families selecting treatment options.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Limb lengthening surgery has seen wide adoption of motorized internal lengthening nails (MILNs). There is limited information about retaining such implants in vivo and re-using them for a second lengthening. Specifically, the internal mechanism of the devices are not designed to be routinely reversed and re-deployed.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective review was performed to determine success rates and complications of re-use of MILNs. Patients were included if they had undergone previous MILN use in the humerus, femur, or tibia, for either lengthening or compression, between 2015 and 2023. Patient data were collected if the magnetically controlled intramedullary lengthening nail underwent attempted re-use in either the same lengthening episode or in a temporally distinct lengthening treatment after a second corticotomy.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Fourteen patients with 16 lengthening episodes were analyzed including six tibial, six femoral, and four humeral segments. Mean age was 13 (range: 6&#x2013;19)&#x2009;years. Overall, 10 of 15 nails (67%) were successfully redeployed without the need for MILN exchange. Five of six nails (80%) were retracted and then re-used for continued distraction in the same lengthening treatment. Five of 10 nails (50%) were successfully reactivated in a separate, later episode of care. In patients for whom nails were successfully reactivated, no additional surgical complications occurred during the reactivation procedure. Nail re-use may have been less successful if the nail mechanism had been fully deployed before attempted retraction (in 50% of such cases, nails failed to retract and were therefore exchanged). Bony ingrowth into empty interlocking holes also may have prevented nail retraction.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Reuse of MILNs for a second lengthening episode is an off-label technique that may be considered for patients requiring ongoing or later lengthening of the femur, tibia, or humerus. Regardless of whether the nail is used in the same or separate lengthening treatment, surgeons should be prepared for exchange to a new implant. Full deployment of MILNs may decrease the likelihood of successful re-use.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Re-use of a magnetically controlled intramedullary lengthening nail will reduce surgical trauma and save implant cost in limb lengthening surgery.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Knee joint line obliquity (JLO), particularly medially directed obliquity, increases the stress on the knee cartilage which can lead to cartilage injury and early onset of osteoarthritis. The incidence JLO after growth modulation (GM) is unknown. The purpose of this study was to define the incidence of knee JLO in the skeletally mature patient after GM of the distal femur (DF) and/or the proximal tibia (PT) for genu valgum or varum.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Retrospective analysis of all patients who underwent GM of the DF and/or PT for genu valgum or varum and followed to skeletal maturity. Only patients with standing AP radiographs of the bilateral lower extremities pre-operatively and at skeletal maturity were included. Patients undergoing an osteotomy of the affected lower extremity after GM and prior to maturity were excluded. Demographic and surgical data were recorded. Radiographic parameters analyzed pre/post-operatively included the mechanical axis deviation (MAD), mechanical lateral distal femoral angle (mLDFA), mechanical medial proximal tibial angle (mMPTA), lateral distal tibia angle (LDTA), joint line convergence angle (JLCA), and joint line obliquity angle (JLOA). JLOA&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;4&#xB0; was considered abnormal. A paired <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-test or Wilcoxon&#x2019;s signed rank test as appropriate for comparisons of pre-post data.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 202 limbs (74 varus, 128 valgus) in 128 patients (74 bilateral) were included. Location of GM was DF (95), PT (70), and DF with PT (39). Most patients underwent single hole (8-plate or O-plate) tension band plating (160, 78%). The MAD was significantly improved at skeletal maturity (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001) for patients with varus and valgus. However, only patients with valgus had a significant change in JLO at skeletal maturity (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001 vs p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.3372 varus). Around 136 limbs (67%) maintained normal JLO or fully corrected JLO at maturity (Table 1). However, 66 (33%) limbs maintained or developed JLO at maturity, with 54 having medially directed JLO. Comparing preoperative varus/valgus in those with JLO at maturity, there was no difference in sex, age at presentation, age at surgery, unilateral versus bilateral, length of follow-up or type/location implant.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> GM significantly improved MAD, but 33% of patients in this cohort demonstrated knee JLO post-operatively, with most having medially directed JLO. 5% of patients were normal preoperatively and ended with JLO.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> GM for the treatment of genu varum and valgum does not fully correct JLO and can make it worse if the DF and/or PT deformities are not properly identified.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Reduced bone density and, consequently, bone strength in non-ambulatory, disabled children present an increasingly significant challenge for orthopedic doctors, neuropediatricians, and medical rehabilitation specialists today. Non-ambulatory and often non-upright children develop secondary juvenile osteoporosis. The lack of natural weight-bearing and insufficient vitamin D3 intake observed in this population lead to low-energy fractures of long bones, jeopardizing their health.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> The study evaluated the following: densitometry of the lumbar spine and the proximal end of the femur, which are the best indicators of bone density in patients. In addition, laboratory tests were conducted, including parathyroid hormone, alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, cross laps, Ca2+, total calcium, Na+, inorganic phosphorus, Mg2+, vitamin D3 level, and albumin level. The study is prospective.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Among the 64 patients examined, 12 (18.75%) had significant deficiencies in vitamin D3 (below 20&#x2009;ng/mL), with 4 (6.25%) patients developing secondary hyperparathyroidism (PTH&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;65). Hypocalcemia (&gt;1.2&#x2009;mmol/L) was observed in 15 (23.43%) patients. Albumin levels below the norm (3.5&#x2009;g/dL) were detected in 5 (7.5%) patients. In addition, densitometry of the lumbar spine or proximal femur was performed on 28 patients. The mean Z-score value for the proximal femur was &#x2013;2.4 with a maximum of 1.1 and a minimum of &#x2013;5.5 (ambulatory: 1.55, non-ambulatory: 3.3). The mean value for the lumbar spine segment was &#x2013;1.37 with a maximum of 1.6 and a minimum of &#x2013;5.2 (ambulatory: 0.55, non-ambulatory: 2.81). This study is one of the few that correlates vitamin D3 levels with the season.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Measurement of vitamin D3 levels, total calcium, ionized calcium, and PTH at least once a year is recommended. Densitometric examination of patients with neuro-orthopedic diseases (especially non-ambulatory) should be conducted at least once every 2&#x2009;years.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> The aim of the study is a comprehensive assessment of bone health in children with neuro-orthopedic diseases resulting in disability in patients. The evaluation will encompass both biochemistry and phosphate-calcium metabolism, as well as bone density assessment using densitometry.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Children with cerebral palsy (CP) often require hip reconstruction with a proximal femoral varus derotation osteotomy (VDRO). After osteotomy healing, the hardware can either be retained or removed; hardware removal can be done reactively due to symptoms or prophylactically. Hardware removal carries the risk of an additional anesthetic and the potential risk of fracture, but this decision remains controversial. The aim of this study was to compare the rate of proximal femoral fractures in children with CP with retained hardware to the rate of proximal femoral fractures in children who had their hardware removed after VDRO. The secondary aim was to identify risk factors for fracture in these patient cohorts.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Out of 334 children with CP undergoing VDRO, 212 children had removal of hardware. Patients were followed from initial VDRO to 2&#x2009;years, hardware removal, or fracture. After hardware removal, patients were followed to a minimum of 2&#x2009;years or until the time of fracture. Chi-square testing was utilized to determine risk factors for fracture following hardware removal. A p-value&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Eleven (3%) out of 334 total patients had a peri-implant fracture after VDRO, 8 (2%) of which were within 2&#x2009;years following their VDRO. Looking at all peri-implant fractures, the median time to fracture was 1.3&#x2009;years with an IQR of 3.2 (range: 0.0&#x2013;12.4)&#x2009;years. Ten (3%) out of 212 patients in the hardware removal group fractured after removal. All 10 fractures were all within 2&#x2009;years of removal. The mean time from hardware removal to fracture was 0.48&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;0.65 (range: 0.02&#x2013;1.94)&#x2009;years. A prior VDRO revision surgery was found to be a significant risk factor for fracture after hardware removal (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.029). Hardware removal less than 1 year after VDRO was also found to be a significant risk factor for fracture (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.007; Table 1).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> There was no difference in the number of fractures between the two groups. We determined that the risk for proximal femoral fractures after hardware removal is increased if the patient has had a prior revision surgery or if the hardware is removed in the first year following VDRO.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This study provides evidence to proceed with caution when removing hardware if a patient has had a prior revision surgery, as well as to wait at least 1 year following VDRO to remove proximal femoral implants.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Single-event multilevel surgery (SEMLS) is routine in children with bilateral cerebral palsy (BCP). While the goal is to provide durable improvements in gait patterns, avoiding multiple, &#x201C;Birthday surgeries&#x201D; over a child&#x2019;s formative years, evidence to support SEMLS is sparse. The aim of this study was to evaluate the medium-term outcomes after SEMLs, focusing on gait parameters, need for further surgeries and complications.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> In this retrospective study, all children with BCP, who had undergone SEMLS between 2010 and 2018 with 5-year post-operative gait analysis data were identified. Gait profile score (GPS) and walking speed were used to evaluate overall gait performance. Sagittal and transverse plane kinematics were assessed as well as reoperation rates and post-operative complications. Pre- and 5-year post-operative comparisons were undertaken using paired t-tests. The role of age at surgery, BMI, and magnitude of surgery on outcome was evaluated with linear regression (alpha&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05).</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Forty-six children were identified with median age at SEMLS of 11.7&#x2009;years (GMFCS II/10 (22%), III/35 (76%), IV/1 (2%)). Mean BMI was 18.1&#x2009;kg/m<sup>2</sup> pre-operative increasing to 21.7&#x2009;kg/m<sup>2</sup> at 5&#x2009;years. About 162 osteotomies were performed in total. Overall mean GPS improved by 2.9&#xB0; from pre-operative mean of 16.9&#xB0;(p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01). GMFCS II improved more than GMFCS III (5.0&#xB0; vs 2.2&#xB0; (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05)). There was no significant change in normalized walking speed at 5&#x2009;years. Knee extension improved from mean &#x2013;17&#xB0; to &#x2013;3.1&#xB0;(p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Rates of anterior pelvic tilt however increased from 67% pre-op to 95% post-op. Improvements in transverse plane kinematics at 5&#x2009;years were noted in 50% of cases. Age at time of surgery, BMI, and number of osteotomies did not impact changes in GPS or walking speed. Seventeen (37%) of patients required subsequent procedures before 5&#x2009;years. Complications include one superficial infection and one patella tendon rupture.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Multi-level surgery provides clinically important differences in GPS at 5&#x2009;years, with maintenance of walking speed. Improvements are greater for GMFCS II patients. Knee sagittal plane kinematics appear to have the most durable improvement, potentially at the expense of increased anterior pelvic tilt. While improvements for some may be modest, this is still preferrable to the natural history of BCP which could be functional deterioration through adolescence. As many patients have secondary procedures, SEMLS can be a misnomer and should be raised in patient/parental discussions before index surgery.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Medium-term data support SEMLS to improve overall gait parameters, however, highlight the high prevalence of further surgeries following index procedure.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Cerebral palsy (CP) often results in co-contraction and flexion of the arm during activity and while walking. Botulinum toxin A (BoNT-A) injections into the biceps brachii may be attempted to increase arm swing and reach.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Nine children with CP, age 3&#x2013;16 (mean: 10)&#x2009;years, planned for BoNT-A injections of the biceps brachii were recruited. Just before the injection, a percutaneous muscle biopsy was taken. After 7&#x2009;months (mean), range 3&#x2013;15&#x2009;months, a second biopsy was taken 1.5&#x2009;cm from the first biopsy. The biopsies were compared to post-mortem biceps brachii samples from 12 typically developed children, mean age 8&#x2009;years, range 3&#x2009;months to 16&#x2009;years. Cryosections were stained immunohistochemically for myosin heavy chains MyHC-1, MyHC-2A, MyHC-fetal, and laminin a2 labeling the basal membrane of muscle fibers and laminin a5 labeling capillaries. NADH-TR staining was used to evaluate the mitochondrial oxidative capacity. Muscle fiber area, the proportion of type 1, type 2A, type 2X fibers, hybrid fibers expressing two MyHC isoforms, and fibers co-expressing developmental MyHCs were evaluated. Differences before and after injection were evaluated with Wilcoxon Signed Rank test, presented as median (min, max).</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> BoNT-A in biceps brachii resulted in an increased fiber area variation (CV) for all fibers (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.05), type 1 fibers (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.03) and for hybrid fibers containing both MyHC-2A and MyHC-2X (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.05). The fiber area for type 2X fibers decreased (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.04). Hybrid fibers containing both type 1 and type 2 myosin increased from 0% to 4% (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.008). Fibers expressing fetal myosin increased from 0.4% [0.0, 1.8] to 1.6% [0.52, 7.88] (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.015), while none were found in muscles of TD children. The NADH-TR activity was normal in the slow-contracting type 1 fibers both before and after the BoNT-A injection, but lower in the fast-contracting type 2 fibers. The capillarity did not change.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> One BoNT-A injection in biceps brachii results in muscle fiber degeneration with decrease of type 2 fiber area and up-regulation of developmental myosins. This is indicative of the toxin&#x2019;s both denervating effect with a parallel regenerative effect. The mitochondrial activity in fast type 2 fibers was reduced in CP, suggesting a lower capacity for work under aerobe conditions.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Botulinum toxin injections have a significant effect on spasticity through its degenerative and regenerative effect on muscles. Effects on different age groups and long-term effects need to be studied further. Fiber area pre- and post-injection per individual. Gray&#x2009;=&#x2009;95% confidence interval for control.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Foot and ankle deformities are common in children with spastic cerebral palsy, often resulting from muscle imbalances between triceps surae and dorsiflexor muscle groups. These deformities lead to the development of spastic planovalgus foot deformities. This study aimed to identify pre-surgical, trans-surgical, and post-surgical factors influencing the recurrence of spastic planovalgus foot deformities and determine the timing of recurrence in our study population.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> We conducted a retrospective observational study involving 132 feet of 82 individuals aged 11&#x2013;18&#x2009;years with spastic planovalgus foot deformities. These patients had undergone surgical interventions involving calcaneal lengthening with reefing medial capsule or talonavicular fusion, with a minimum follow-up of 2&#x2009;years between January 2014 and December 2020.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> The analysis revealed a median surgical age of 14.1&#x2009;years, with 40.2% females and 59.8% males. Among these cases, 47% affected the right foot, 49.2% the left, and 3.8% were bilateral. Interestingly, male patients exhibited a higher risk of recurrence in the anteroposterior talo-first metatarsal angle and CA-MT5 angles at 6&#x2009;months post-surgery. Patients with monoplegia and hemiplegia also faced an increased risk of recurrence in various angles at different time points compared to counterparts with diplegia, triplegia, and tetraplegia. Conversely, patients with diplegia, triplegia, and tetraplegia had an elevated risk of recurrence in specific angles at 6&#x2009;months post-surgery. In addition, individuals with GMFCS levels I, II, and III showed an increased risk of recurrence in various angles at different post-surgical intervals. Patients with joint distances exceeding 15&#x2009;mm to perform osteotomy had a higher risk of recurrence in specific angles measured after surgery. Notably, graft implantation served as a protective factor against recurrence at 2&#x2009;years post-surgery, whereas reefing medial capsule increased the risk compared to fusion at 6&#x2009;months post-surgery.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In summary, this study highlights significant factors influencing the recurrence of spastic planovalgus foot deformities following surgical interventions. Male patients, those with monoplegia, hemiplegia, higher GMFCS levels, and larger joint distances exhibited an increased risk of recurrence in specific foot angle measurements at various postoperative time points. Conversely, graft implantation appeared protective against recurrence, while reefing medial capsule was associated with a higher risk than fusion. These findings emphasize the importance of personalized treatment approaches, considering individual patient characteristics and surgical techniques, to optimize postoperative outcomes and long-term foot function.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Level of evidence: III. Prospective cohort study.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Spinopelvic malalignment is commonly seen with non-ambulatory cerebral palsy (CP). Axial plane deformation is not well described in the literature. The purpose of this study was to describe and quantify the axial plane deformity in cerebral palsy using CT scans and compare it to normal controls.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> We retrospectively collected data using CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis of 40 patients with GMFCS IV/V CP, and neuromuscular scoliosis (CPP) were recorded and matched by age and sex to normal controls (NP). Pre-operative Cobb angle was recorded for the CP patients. Pelvic anatomy was evaluated at the supra-acetabular region of bone using two angles&#x2014;iliac wing angle (angle between a line drawn from the midportion of the posterior ilium to the midportion of the anterior inferior iliac spine and a line bisecting the hemipelvis) and sacral ala angle (angle between a line drawn from the midportion of the posterior ilium to the midportion of the anterior inferior iliac spine and a line bisecting the hemipelvis) measured for each hemipelvis. The larger of the two angles was considered externally rotated while the smaller angle was considered internally rotated and termed as follows&#x2014;iliac wing external (IWE), iliac wing internal (IWI), sacral ala external (SAE), and sacral ala internal (SAI). Differences were noted using an independent t-test while correlations with Cobb angle were done using Pearson&#x2019;s correlation.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Iliac wing measurements showed external rotation, IWE was 47.3&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;18.1&#xB0; in CPP versus 26.4&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;3.7&#xB0; in NP (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) while sacral ala measurements showed both external and internal rotation SAE was 119.5&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;9.5&#xB0; in CPP versus 111.2&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;7.7&#xB0; in NP (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) while SAI was 114.1&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;8.5&#xB0; in CPP versus 107.9&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;7.5&#xB0; in NP (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001). In the CP cohort, the mean Cobb angle was 61.54&#xB0; (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;37/40) (Table 1). Cobb angle correlated with the degree of external iliac wing rotation&#x2014;IWE (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.457, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.004) and degree of absolute difference in the rotation of the iliac wing (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.506, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The pelvis in the CP patient is asymmetrically oriented exhibiting a greater external rotation of one hemipelvis relative to normal controls. The severity of neuromuscular scoliosis is related to the pelvic axial rotation in CP patients.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Surgeons should consider pelvic malalignment and its evaluation in the management of the non-ambulatory CP patient as this may have a role in pain, spinopelvic instrumentation strategies, and outcomes of supra-pelvic and infra-pelvic pathologies.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> The progression of neurologic equinovarus foot (NEVF) during growth leads in the later stages to a non-reducible talonavicular (TN) joint subluxation and talocalcaneal (TC) malalignment. The surgical treatment of this deformity in pediatric age consists of soft tissue surgery associated or not with bone procedures, however, obtaining TC divergence and TN coverage is often complicated in severe and rigid feet. The aim of this study is to describe a novel surgical approach, using a talo-calcaneal-navicular realignment (TCNR) technique, which reconstructs the acetabulum pedis, associated with other procedures, in patients with severe NEVF, and to analyze the mid-term results.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Prospective study of children with severe NEVF who underwent surgery using the TCNR technique (Figure 1A) at a pediatric referral center between 2020 and 2022 and who had a minimum 1-year follow-up. Radiologic measurements were performed on pre- and post-operative weight-bearing radiographs of both feet in ambulatory patients. The Foot &amp; Ankle Disability Index (FADI), the Foot Function Index (FFI) and the Maryland Foot Score (MFS) were used to assess functionality before and after. Qualitative questions regarding improvement, satisfaction, and expectations after the procedure were administered to all patients/caregivers. A pre&#x2013;post comparative analysis using the Wilcoxon test for paired samples was performed.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Twenty-seven patients (13 males/14 females) and 36 feet were included. Of these, 48.8% had cerebral palsy, 25.7% Charcot Marie Tooth, 11.4% hereditary spastic paraparesis, 8.5% myelomeningocele and 8.6% other syndromes. The median age at the time of surgery was 11.77&#x2009;years (interquartile range (IQR): 10.17&#x2013;12.95) and median follow-up was 22.13 (32.6&#x2013;41.63)&#x2009;months. A statistically significant improvement was obtained for the following radiological parameters (Figure 1B-C): TC or Kite&#x2019;s Angle &#x2212;5.5&#xB0; (&#x2013;16.9 to &#x2013;0.1) versus 17.2&#xB0; (8.8&#x2013;22.4), p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001; Talo-1st Metatarsal Angle &#x2013;48.5&#xB0; (&#x2013;55.4 to &#x2013;36.5) versus &#x2013;8.7&#xB0; (&#x2212;12 to &#x2013;1.4), p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001 and Talo-Navicular Coverage Angle &#x2212;40&#xB0; (&#x2212;45.7 to &#x2212;31) versus 2.3&#xB0; (&#x2212;2.5 to &#x2013;5.5), p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001. All the functional scores improved significantly (Figure 1D): FADI 26.4% (14.4&#x2013;37.3) versus 78.8% (56.7&#x2013;80.8), p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.03; FFI 92.1% (69.9&#x2013;94) versus 31.2% (25.1&#x2013;38.5), p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.04; MFS 40.5% (17.5&#x2013;51.5) versus 84.5% (82&#x2013;87.5), p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.04. All patients/caregivers reported that function had improved greatly, results were much better than expected, would recommend the intervention to other patients, would undergo surgery again, and were highly satisfied. There were three complications: transient neuropathic pain in one foot, a partial recurrence, and a case of under correction.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The TCNR technique improves the radiological TC divergence and TN coverage, as well as the functional outcomes; patients/caregivers&#x2019; satisfaction is high.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> The presented surgical approach, using the TCNR technique, represents a paradigm shift in the management of severe NEVF.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Hereditary spastic paraparesis (HSP) is a heterogenous group of inherited disorders that injure the corticospinal tracts and result in spasticity, weakness, and gait deviations. More than 90 genes have been identified which produce great variability in the clinical presentation of HSP patients. Some patients show minimal neurological signs, and others have profound impairments that preclude ambulation. While it is often thought to be a progressive disorder, objective data proving decline in function or gait is sparse. Early onset patients, defined as symptoms present before the age of 2, are considered less likely to show progression over time.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Around 23 HSP patients, 12 genetically confirmed (GC) and 11 genetically presumed (GP), were prospectively enrolled in a longitudinal, objective analysis of gait. All patients completed a series of comprehensive three-dimensional gait analyses (3DGAs) based on study design and patient availability. Patient&#x2019;s first and most recent studies were selected for analysis which yielded an average of 7&#x2009;years between visits. Calculation of the Gait deviation Index (GDI) and the Gait Profile Score (GPS) with the associated movement analysis profile (MAP) scores was completed for both time points.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> In the CG group, the age of symptom onset was from birth to age 11.9&#x2009;years, and in the GP, the age of onset was from 0.5 to 8.0&#x2009;years. Using Wilcoxon test, when reviewing all HSP patients as total cohort, there were no significant changes in the GDI or GPS when comparing the baseline and final study. When assessing the GC only cohort, there was a statistically significant decline in the GDI from 63.6&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;11.5 to 57.2&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;3.8 (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0425), and the GPS approached a significant change (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0522). Spearman&#x2019;s correlation did not find a statistically significant correlation between the age of onset of symptoms and the amount of GDI decline between visits for the group as a whole, the GC, or GP cohorts.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The GC HSP patients showed a statistically significant decline in the GDI when comparing 3DGA over time. No correlation between age of symptom onset and amount of gait decline was found. Deterioration of gait can be expected in many patients with HSP, potentially including those with early onset.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> In a GC cohort of HSP patients, a decline in the GDI is possible. Long-term follow-up is needed to decide if and when gait may stabilize, and the effect of early onset disability.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Health system supply chain research demonstrates that orthopedic procedures are key drivers of surgical budgets. Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) significantly impacts healthcare costs, due to high cost/procedure, and more than 200,000 such procedures annually. The purpose of this study was to analyze ACLR surgery costs at a single hospital, identify cost variation categories, and identify variables to share with clinicians to improve values.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Using cost data obtained from Epic<sup>&#xAE;</sup>, a cost review analysis was performed for all ACLR procedures with and without meniscus repair performed by four surgeons at one institution between March 2022 to July 2023. The procedures were identified using Current Procedural Terminology for ACLR (code 29888). Total procedure cost was subdivided into supply costs and implant costs, considering factors like graft type/source, surgical side, presence of meniscal injuries, and femoral and tibial fixation. Statistical analysis involved a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to evaluate cost differences across categories. All data were deidentified, and therefore, exempt from Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Graft source significantly affected supply (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002) and implant costs (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.003) in ACLR procedures. Autografts cases had higher supply costs (mean&#x2009;=$2388.14) and allografts had increased implant costs (mean&#x2009;=$3136.50). Graft type influenced total procedure cost (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.038), supply costs (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.005), and implant costs (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.017), with quadriceps tendon autograft being the costliest (mean&#x2009;=$4489.61). The absence of meniscal tears led to the least expensive ACLR (mean total procedure cost: $2754.08; mean supply costs: $1046.38), while medial meniscus tears led to the most expensive ACLR (mean total procedure cost: $5547.49; mean supply costs: $3450.88). The meniscus repair mechanism also affected the total procedure cost (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) and supply costs (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), with the inside-out repair method being the most expensive (mean&#x2009;=$6468.31 for total procedure cost; mean&#x2009;=$3275.68 for supply costs). Finally, femoral fixation played a role in total procedure cost (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.009), with fixed-loop fixation being the most expensive (mean&#x2009;=$4555.78).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This study provides a detailed insight into the cost variability associated with isolated ACLR procedures in a pediatric population. By identifying individual cost components linked to surgical attributes, meniscal repair, and fixation techniques, we present a roadmap for potential cost optimization strategies. Key categories identified for value optimization include graft choice, femoral/tibial fixation, and meniscus implants.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This comprehensive cost analysis of ACLR procedures reveals the significant impact of graft source/type, meniscal injuries, and graft fixation methods on costs. It offers a clear path for surgeons and organizations to improve value for surgical interventions.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Casting is routinely used in orthopedics. Preventing a wet cast is crucial for maintaining structural integrity and reducing unwanted complications like unnecessary skin irritation/ulceration, bacterial overgrowth, and unnecessary Emergency Department (ED) visits. Using experimental models, studies have tested various contemporary methods to prevent a wet cast. One such study found that in comparison the most effective and cost-conscious approach was to use a DIY cast cover using a double-bag technique sealed with tape. There is a paucity of literature on the utility of this technique in vivo. The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of the DIY cast cover on human test subjects.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Casts were applied to 10 arms and 10 legs. Each cast was removed after they were deemed dry. These casts were subsequently weighed until they achieved steady state. Each cast was then reapplied to the subject&#x2019;s extremity and held together with tape. A trash bag was then applied around the cast and then secured with tape to the skin. This was repeated to create a double seal (Figure 1). Casts were submerged under water for two minutes. After submersion, the cover was removed, and the cast was re-weighed. The casts were then submerged completely without any protection for 2&#x2009;minutes and their fully saturated weight was recorded. Efficacy was determined by comparing the post-submersion and full-submersion weights. Data was analyzed using Mann&#x2013;Whitney test.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> The percentage of water absorption prevention ranged from 96.8% to 99.9%, with an average 99.6% across the entire study sample. No adverse effects were reported.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our findings conclude that the double-bag with Duct-tape method is effective at preventing external water absorption. This in vivo study demonstrates that almost all external water absorption can be prevented using this simple and inexpensive technique.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This study provides insight on the utility of inexpensive and accessible methods of preventing wet casts in the daily routines of patients. More studies are warranted to elucidate what cast cover techniques may prove ineffective and thus compromise clinical management of a given fracture site.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Surgery under wide awake local anesthesia is a technique increasingly utilized, particularly in hand surgery. Benefits include decreased healthcare costs, less environmental waste, decreased healthcare worker personnel requirements (particularly important since the COVID-19 pandemic onset), intraoperative assessment of active limb function, less postoperative pain, improved postoperative rehabilitation, and improved physician&#x2013;patient interaction. While its benefits and feasibility are well documented in the adult hand surgery literature, descriptions of its use in pediatric settings are lacking. This retrospective review of a single surgeon&#x2019;s pediatric hospital-based practice details its utility in children and young adults.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective cohort was identified utilizing electronic medical record query to capture orthopedic surgery cases performed between July 2018 and September 2023 in a pediatric hospital and ambulatory surgery center. Charts were reviewed for patient demographic data, procedural information, and complications. All data were deidentified and encrypted in compliance with HIPAA standards.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 127 patients were identified to have undergone wide awake orthopedic surgery in a pediatric hospital or surgery center. Around 100 patients were between 8 and 18&#x2009;years of age, with the remaining between 19 and 43. Lengths of surgery varied between 15 and 213&#x2009;minutes with a median time of 38&#x2009;minutes. No intraoperative or postoperative complications occurred. Most procedures were soft tissue only, such as trigger digit releases and excision of upper extremity lesions. More complex procedures included cubital tunnel release with ulnar nerve transposition, revision tendon transfers, and nerve/tendon repair. Bony procedures included percutaneous pinning of hand fractures, excision/grafting/fixation of pathologic fracture from enchondroma, excision of an exostosis, and a removal of hardware. Most surgeries were on the upper extremity. Lower extremity surgeries included peroneal nerve decompression at the fibular neck, foot extensor repair, and osteochondroma excision from the fibula (see figure, 14yo male). No procedures had the presence of an anesthesiologist nor converted into a different anesthesia category. No patients were instructed to be fasting, and no patients received IV placement.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> With appropriate patient selection and technique, wide awake orthopedic surgery is safe and well tolerated in children without the backup of anesthesia being present, and there is no need for patients to have IV access or be fasting for potential sedation.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Wide awake orthopedic surgery is safe in a pediatric healthcare setting. The monetary and environmental savings from this method significantly increase value in pediatric orthopedic surgery.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> In the Netherlands, infants with an abnormal clinical examination or risk factors for developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) are referred for hip ultrasound assessment at the age of 3&#x2009;months. This retrospective study aims to analyze the incidence of late diagnosis (&#x2265;4&#x2009;months), the presence of risk factors and/or abnormal clinical examination, and the time between referral and presentation at the hospital.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A total of 1038 referred at-risk infants were assessed for DDH at a university hospital in the Netherlands between January 2019 and August 2022. Infants with syndromic diseases were excluded. Late DDH diagnosis was defined as infants aged 4 months or older at the assessment. Risk factors (positive first-generation family history of DDH and/or breech position after week 32) and clinical examination (knee height discrepancy and/or limited passive hip abduction) were re-examined in the hospital.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> In total, 975 infants (58% female) with an average age of 19&#x2009;weeks (SD 15.4, maximum 186&#x2009;weeks) were included. DDH was diagnosed in 11% of infants via ultrasound or pelvic radiographs. Late DDH assessment occurred in 31% of infants and late diagnosis occurred in 36% of infants with DDH. Re-examined risk factors and/or abnormal clinical examination were present in 83% of infants with DDH and in 82% of late diagnoses. The average time between referral and presentation at the hospital was 5&#x2009;weeks, with a maximum of 38&#x2009;weeks.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> One third of DDH diagnoses occur at the age of 4&#x2009;months or older in a university hospital in the Netherlands using selective ultrasound screening. This study suggests that more education is warranted in the Dutch national screening program for healthcare providers and parents/caregivers to provide timely and optimal treatment. Future studies should replicate these findings in a larger population using selective ultrasound screening and study the role of additional educational programs, for example, health applications.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> More education for healthcare providers and parents/caregivers is warranted to provide timely and optimal treatment for infants with DDH.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Regional anesthetic techniques are frequently utilized in pediatric lower and upper extremity surgeries as they offer potential improvement in post-operative pain control while reducing time to discharge. However, there are certain risks and benefits that need to be considered. While the nature and frequency of short-term complications following peripheral nerve blocks (PNBs) in pediatric orthopedics are well described in the literature, the incidence and reporting of long-term complications (occurring&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;6&#x2009;weeks from the date of procedure) are often overlooked. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the frequency of which long-term complications are reported in pediatric patients undergoing regional anesthesia for lower extremity orthopedic procedures.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A systematic literature search was performed using the PRISMA guidelines. Inclusion criteria included pediatric patients, block type, block location, procedure type, cohort age, experimental design, and outcome data reported. Full texts were then thoroughly examined to determine whether the paper referred to long-term (&gt;6&#x2009;weeks) complications in pediatric patients undergoing PNBs. Data were collected regarding the number and types of block complications reported across all papers.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 158 studies met inclusion criteria. Only 16/158 (10%) of studies included discussion of long-term complications (&gt;6&#x2009;weeks) in pediatric PNBs. Of those 16 studies, 7 documented long-term complications, while 9 reported no complications. The most common complications were motor deficits, loss of range of motion, and neurological paresthesias. Of the studies reporting long-term complications related to PNBs, 16/352 patients across 2 studies (5%) reported chronic pain, 45/250 patients over 4 studies (18%) reported strength deficits, 74/350 patients over 3 studies (21%) reported reduced range of motion, and 11/10,143 patients over 4 studies (0.001%) reported sensory deficits.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> While relatively rare, long-term complications do occur in pediatric patients undergoing lower extremity procedures with PNBs. This systematic review suggests that these complications are underreported in the current literature. Many papers do not address complications at all and those that do tend to focus on short-term complications or small populations of patients.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> As utilization of PNBs increases, it is essential that systems for monitoring and documenting long-term complications are implemented. This way, providers will be empowered to engage in shared decision-making in preoperative conversations with patients and their families regarding the risks and benefits of various modes of peri- and post-operative pain management.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Perioperative exposure radiation in pediatric orthopedic surgery carries risks, both for children who have increased radiosensitivity and for surgeons who accumulate significant radiation exposure during their practice. Therefore, optimizing the perioperative use of these rays is crucial. The aim of this study is to quantify the radiation dose used in pediatric orthopedic and traumatology surgeries to demonstrate the benefits of measures taken to limit preoperative irradiation.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> We retrospectively analyzed radiation doses recorded during surgery for patients under the age of 18 who underwent orthopedic procedures over a 28-month period from December 2019 to April 2022. For each surgical procedure, the radiation dose was quantified in terms of cumulative dose surface (CDS) expressed in mGy&#xB7;cm&#xB2;.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Perioperative radiation exposure was analyzed for 1789 surgeries. Treatments for slipped femoral epiphysis (SFE), scoliosis, and lower limb lengthening procedures were the most irradiating procedures. The mean&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;standard deviation doses were 380&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;513 mGy&#xB7;cm&#xB2; for SFE, 459&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;432 mGy&#xB7;cm&#xB2; for scoliosis, and 327&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;334 mGy&#xB7;cm&#xB2; for lower limb lengthening. Radiation doses for trauma procedures were relatively low, with means&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;standard deviations of 85&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;144 mGy&#xB7;cm&#xB2; for lower limb trauma procedures and 42&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;77 mGy&#xB7;cm&#xB2; for upper limb trauma procedures.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Optimizing radiation doses is essential to obtain sufficient image quality with low radiation risk. The choice of suitable equipment for pediatric patients, the use of additional filters, and removable anti-scatter grids are key elements of this optimization. There is significant variation in radiation doses for the same surgery, which can be attributed to the complexity of each case, but also to the adherence to recommended practice measures such as adjusting default low-dose protocols and using pulsed fluoroscopy.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> These measures have enabled the implementation of the ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable) principle and have resulted in low radiation exposure compared to recent published studies. The maximum radiation doses observed are well below the alert thresholds set by the French Health Authority (HAS) at 500,000 mGy&#xB7;cm&#xB2;, but the cumulative dose remains significant for the surgeon. Radiation doses during pediatric orthopedic surgeries, while largely below alert thresholds, should be kept as low as reasonably achievable for the radiation protection of children and the healthcare team.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Development of quality metrics and evaluation of orthopedic programs by external organizations, previously contained to total joints and spine surgery, is now burgeoning in pediatric orthopedics. However, these external organizations rarely consult pediatric orthopedists themselves during development of their metrics. Therefore, POSNA members strongly supported the creation of a new performance evaluation. As a result, POSNA developed a member-driven process for driving quality improvements in pediatric orthopedics: the POSNA Safe Surgery Program (PSSP). The PSSP aims to develop key quality metrics that members believe improve outcomes in pediatric orthopedics. After several years of beta testing, this study aims to summarize the first year roll out of PSSP quality metrics to the entire POSNA membership.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> The POSNA Quality, Safety, and Value Initiative (QSVI) Council developed 24 PSSP quality metrics for six domains: sports medicine, trauma, spine, hip/lower extremity (LE), hand/upper extremity (UE), and neuromuscular. The quality metrics were integrated into six online surveys (one per domain) and distributed to POSNA member orthopedic centers across North America. Roll out went live at the POSNA 2023 annual meeting. To increase engagement and include members who did not attend the annual meeting, each member of the POSNA community received a personalized email explaining the program and requesting participation.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> About 64 POSNA member orthopedic centers (approximately 25% of all US centers) responded to at least one domain-specific survey. Spine had the highest participation (37 sites) while hand/UE and hip/LE had the lowest (27 sites each). Centers meeting each quality metric ranged from 52% to 83% in sports medicine; 49% to 92% in trauma; 72% to 98% in spine; 81% to 92% in hip/LE; 70% to 100% in hand/UE; and 69% to 100% in neuromuscular. Many sites uploaded detailed protocols and procedures which could be easily replicated by other centers.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In its first year roll out to the entire POSNA membership, PSSP demonstrated that these quality metrics can be successfully distributed and attained by POSNA sites throughout the United States regardless of the size of the institution. Our future work will focus on expanding the PSSP to more pediatric orthopedic centers, iteratively evaluating and modifying the metrics and adding metrics for additional domains.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> The primary goal of PSSP is to create internally developed, surgeon-driven quality metrics that determine high-quality care. Surgeons can gain institutional resources and support by using the quality metrics and reports to drive improvements in their centers.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Tibial tubercle osteotomies (TTOs) are an important adjunct in the treatment of patellar instability and other adolescent knee pathology. While often scheduled with a post-operative admission for peri-operative pain management or concerns regarding potential complications, little data are available on this procedure in the outpatient setting. Safely performing TTOs in the outpatient setting may improve efficiency and cost-of-care delivery. The aim of this study is to examine the safety of adolescent TTO performed in the outpatient setting at a pediatric sports medicine ambulatory surgical center.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Consecutive patients who underwent TTO scheduled as an outpatient procedure for patellar instability treated at a single institution from February 2017 to February 2022 were reviewed. Demographics, surgical procedures, and modified Clavien&#x2013;Dindo classified complications were recorded. Single-shot block and incisional anesthetic were routinely utilized, and a standard protocol of alternating home acetaminophen and oral ketorolac (12 doses) was employed; with 12 tramadol (oxycodone for younger age or other contraindications) doses available for severe pain. TTOs, either anteromedialization, medialization, or combined with a distalization, were performed by 1 of 2 surgeons. Descriptive analysis was performed.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Around 98 patients (64 female, mean&#x2009;=&#x2009;15.6&#x2009;years, range&#x2009;=&#x2009;12&#x2013;22&#x2009;years) with 3&#x2009;month follow-up were included for analysis with a majority 80% receiving adductor/popliteal nerve blocks while 14% having an isolated adductor block. About 79 patients underwent TTO with medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction (MPFLR) with/without additional minor procedure, 11 patients underwent TTO/MPFLR with osteochondral allograft transplantation, 2 patients underwent TTO/MPFLR with quadricepsplasty, and 4 patients underwent TTO with revision MPFL reconstruction. Average tourniquet time was 110&#x2009;minutes, with an average time of 108&#x2009;minutes spent in PACU prior to discharge. There were 8 (8.2%) complications (CD II or III). Six patients (6.1%) required early clinic follow-up: 3 (3.1%) for incisional pain/bleeding, 2 (2.0%) for swelling of the operative extremity with negative workup for deep venous thrombosis, and 1 (1.0%) for incisional erythema that resolved uneventfully. Two patients (2.0%) required revision surgery; one for fracture at the osteotomy site (8&#x2009;weeks post-operative) and one for knee stiffness (12&#x2009;weeks post-operative).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This study highlights a favorable complication profile and no required admissions utilizing regional anesthesia and a standardized outpatient pain control protocol. TTO may be performed in adolescents on an outpatient basis as a means of improving efficiency of care delivery.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> TTOs can be safely performed on adolescent patients in an outpatient setting with minimal complications.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> The adoption of robotics coupled with navigation (RAN) for pedicle screw placement in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) may be done effectively with similar intraoperative performance and safety profile when compared to freehand (FH) technique. Evaluation of intraoperative and postoperative outcomes over time is greatly aided by surgical dashboarding. Dashboarding allows participants to track and identify areas for improvement as well as analyze their performance individually or compared to peers. Using a cohort of pediatric patients who underwent posterior spinal fusion for AIS by one surgeon from 2016 to 2023 and were enrolled in the Surgeon Performance Program (SPP) Quality Improvement Registry, we employ SPP metrics to compare quality and safety outcomes using RAN versus FH in AIS surgery.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Demographics and radiographs were summarized with descriptive statistics. Surgical measures, radiographic outcomes, and complications from the SPP were compared between groups as well as against national means using appropriate statistical tests including t-tests, Wilcoxon tests, Fisher&#x2019;s exact tests, and chi-square tests based on data distribution.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> The cohort included 215 patients (121 FH, 94 RAN). Demographics and preoperative radiographic measures did not differ between groups. The mean age at surgery was 15.3&#x2009;years, and most patients were female (82%). Dashboarding revealed RAN had significantly longer mean surgical times (240&#x2009;m vs 192&#x2009;m; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), similar EBL, and higher curve correction (70% vs 60%; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.003) than FH patients. There were no differences in complication rates found between RAN and FH (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.3). Compared to national averages in SPP, quartiles for surgical time, EBL, and complications were the same for each group. There were no deep infections, neurologic deficits, or return to OR for mispositioned screws in either group (Table 1).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Based on dashboarding results from the SPP registry, RAN was associated with an increase in surgical time; however, EBL and safety profiles were similar. While curve correction was higher in the RAN cohort, it is unclear whether this is due to the adoption of robotics or a multitude of variables.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This is the first reported pediatric series documenting the importance and benefits of utilizing dashboarding when adopting robotic technology into surgical practice.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is a common congenital disorder in infants. When undetected, it can cause hip dislocation in around 10% of affected individuals, leading to surgical treatments later in life. Ultrasound is a proven and less-invasive method for DDH detection compared to radiographic techniques. In our research, we have harnessed the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to pinpoint vital markers on ultrasonography images, based on Graf&#x2019;s method, enhancing DDH detection.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Between September 2017 and September 2020, we amassed hip ultrasonography images from 826 neonates (0&#x2013;4&#x2009;months of age), resulting in 2188 images in total. Three experienced orthopedists annotated each image, highlighting five essential markers. These markers create three lines, crucial for calculating alpha and beta angles. A UNet model underwent training to detect these markers (1754 training images; 434 images for validation/testing). The model&#x2019;s accuracy was gauged in three distinct ways: comparing predicted markers to the actual ones, discrepancies in line angles and lengths, and the relation between AI-derived angles and those annotated by orthopedists. Bland&#x2013;Altman plots served to compare the agreement of the AI model and orthopedist annotations.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> The AI model&#x2019;s predicted markers had a minimal variance of under 5 pixels from the actual markers (all p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). There was less than a 5&#x2009;mm (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05) discrepancy in line lengths and under 10&#xB0; (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05) for angles as predicted by the model in comparison to the actual data. The alpha and beta angles, as predicted by the model, had a strong resemblance to the orthopedists&#x2019; annotations (alpha, R&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.86, P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001, RMSE&#x2009;=&#x2009;3.4; beta, R&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.72, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01, RMSE&#x2009;=&#x2009;7.09). The Bland&#x2013;Altman plots reflected a consistent pattern for both alpha (RPC&#x2009;=&#x2009;6.68) and beta (RPC&#x2009;=&#x2009;13.9) angles. In terms of clinical variance (alpha&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;60&#xB0; vs &lt;60&#xB0;), the AI model boasted a classification accuracy of 0.87 and an F1-score of 0.72, especially for uneven datasets.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our AI-driven model demonstrates proficiency in discerning the five pivotal markers from hip ultrasonography images. The alpha and beta angles, as derived by the model, align closely with expert evaluations. This signifies the potential of our AI model as a powerful adjunct in the clinical diagnostic process for DDH.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Harnessing AI in orthopedic diagnostics offers precise and reliable evaluations, especially in DDH detection. Our research showcases the potential of neural networks in enhancing the accuracy of ultrasound imaging, potentially reducing the need for invasive procedures and subsequent surgical treatments in affected individuals.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> This is a multicenter prospective study presenting safety and efficacy data at 2-year follow-up of a novel posterior dynamic distraction device (PDDD) for use in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) after it received humanitarian use device (HUD) approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) in 2019.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A total of 149 patients with AIS who met FDA-approved criteria for PDDD were prospectively enrolled from 13 US sites between June 2020 and April 2023. Demographics, surgical details, and adverse events for all patients are reported, as well as the durability of the device and curve correction for patients with 2-year follow-up.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Data were available for 149 patients. Mean age at surgery was 14.8&#x2009;years and 75% were female. Mean procedure time was 112&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;34&#x2009;minutes, and the mean estimated blood loss was 38.1&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;33.9 mL. Mean preoperative primary Cobb angle was 47.5&#xB0;&#xB1;&#x2009;7.3&#xB0; (range: 34&#xB0;&#x2013;61&#xB0;) with flexibility to 17.6&#xB0;&#xB1;&#x2009;6.6&#xB0; (range: 4&#xB0;&#x2013;30&#xB0;). Mean Cobb angle at the first erect visit was 18.7&#xB0;&#xB1;&#x2009;7.0&#xB0; (range: 7&#xB0;&#x2013;40&#xB0;). Mean hospital length of stay was 1.3&#x2009;days (range: 1&#x2013;12&#x2009;days). About 21 patients (14.1%) had 23 reoperations, which included 14 PDDD revisions (9.4%) and 7 PDDD removals (4.7%). Two patients were converted to posterior spinal fusion (1.3%). Reasons for reoperation included implant breakage (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;8), curve progression (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;4), infection (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;3), and screw migration or misplacement (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;3). One patient had a dural leak and was also admitted 1-month post-surgery for wound irrigation and debridement. Both events resolved without sequelae. No neurologic issues were noted. Twenty-five patients reached 2-year follow-up with X-rays available. Of these 25, 16 were Lenke 1 and 9 were Lenke 5. Mean pre-operative Cobb angles, flexibility, and first erect Cobb angles were like the entire cohort. (Table 1). At 2&#x2009;years, curve correction to &#x2264;30&#xB0; was noted for 92%, and post-operative correction was maintained at the last follow-up (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.629). Five of the 25 patients (20%) had revision surgery, 3 implant revisions and 2 implant removals.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> PDDD correction of Cobb angles was substantial and durable at 2-year follow-up for most patients, with revision rates like those reported for other non-fusion scoliosis procedures. This study suggests that PDDD is effective in avoiding spinal fusion at 2-year follow-up for most patients with AIS and flexible primary curves.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> PDDD shows promise in the avoidance of spinal fusion for AIS patients with flexible primary curves. Ongoing study is needed to determine the true incidence of long-term complications.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is the most common spinal deformity in children. Severe AIS may necessitate surgical intervention with posterior spinal instrumentation and fusion (PSIF). Both long-active intravenous and intrathecal opioids have been used as part of multimodal pain control to reduce perioperative pain. The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of intrathecal morphine injection with intravenous methadone as perioperative pain control agents for PSIF for AIS.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A 3-year retrospective study included patients younger than 26 who had undergone PSIF for AIS from June 2020 through June 2023. Patients who received intraoperative IV methadone were compared to those who received intraoperative intrathecal morphine injection. The medication administered was determined by surgeon/anesthesiologist preference and a change in the perioperative pain control protocol. Electronic medical records were reviewed for opioid use, length of time from room to surgery start time, length of stay, blood loss, pain scales, adverse events, wake up times, and time from end of surgery to first standing and to first ambulating with and without assistance.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Among the 132 pediatric patients who underwent PSIF for AIS, 97 patients met the inclusion criteria with 49 patients receiving IV methadone and 48 receiving intrathecal morphine injection. There was no difference in preoperative Cobb angle, number of levels of fusion, or Cobb angle correction. In addition, there was no significant difference in total morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs) administered throughout hospitalization, complications, or average visual analog pain levels. Patients receiving intrathecal morphine had longer time from in room to surgery start, 1.9 hours versus 1.7 hours (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05), and equivalent wake up times (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.60). Patients receiving IV methadone had shorter time to stand with assistance (21.6&#x2009;h vs 25&#x2009;h; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05) and ambulation with assistance (27.3&#x2009;h vs 33.0&#x2009;h; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). Blood loss was also higher in patients receiving intrathecal morphine, 590&#x2009;mL vs 458&#x2009;mL (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> While these two methods of pain control for PSIF in AIS did not differ in MME administered throughout hospitalization, use of IV methadone offers equivalent pain control with reduced anesthesia time and more rapid mobilization compared to intrathecal morphine injection.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This study improves our understanding of the differences between IV methadone and intrathecal morphine injection and may aid decision-making regarding pain control for this surgical procedure.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> The CSVL is typically used to determine the last touched vertebra (LTV) and helps with selection of the lowest instrumented vertebra (LIV) during posterior spinal fusion for the treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). Traditionally, the CSVL is drawn as a vertical line from the middle of the patient&#x2019;s sacrum, which is termed the &#x201C;sacral&#x201D; method. However, the CSVL can also be drawn as a line which perpendicularly bisects a horizontal line tangent to the top of the patient&#x2019;s iliac crests, or the &#x201C;iliac&#x201D; method (Figure 1). No studies to date have compared these CSVL methods in patients with AIS. The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of the sacral and iliac CSVL methods on LIV selection and curve correction at long-term follow-up.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Charts of patients in a prospective AIS registry who underwent PSF between 2003 and 2022 were reviewed. Patients with &lt;60&#x2009;months of follow-up were excluded. Six reviewers applied the two CSVL methods to determine the LTV with an ICC 0.873 for the iliac method and 0.879 for the sacral method.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 161 patients with AIS (87% female, mean age at PSF 13.8&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;2&#x2009;years) were included, with a mean follow-up of 83&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;26&#x2009;months. Both the iliac and sacral methods resulted in selection of the same LTV in 63% of patients (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;102). For the 59 patients where the two CSVL methods chose different LTVs, this occurred most often in Lenke lumbar modifier A curves, followed by C curves (Table 1). After PSF, 35% (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;57) of patients were fused below the LTV chosen by the sacral CSVL method, while 34.2% (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;55) were fused below the LTV chosen by the iliac CSVL method; this difference was not significant. At a mean of 5&#x2009;years follow-up, there was no difference in major curve magnitude, or the percent correction of the major curve based on whether the CSVL methods chose the same LTV or a different LTV (Table 1).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Most of the time, the iliac and sacral CSVL methods select the same LTV. However, when they do not, there is no difference at 5&#x2009;years post-operative in overall curve correction or curve magnitude.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Selection of the distal fusion level can significantly impact clinical outcomes as the LIV can determine the stability of the implanted construct. Surgeons may continue using whichever CSVL method they are most comfortable with, without fear of adverse patient outcomes.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Accurate pedicle screw insertion technique remains paramount to safe and successful deformity correction particularly in complex scenarios. Patient-specific 3D-printed guides has recently emerged as an alternative technique offering comprehensive preoperative planning of screw size, length, and trajectories and offer more efficient workflow with predictable accuracy. This study aimed to (1) analyze accuracy of screw placement using this technique using intraoperative computed tomography (CT) analysis and (2) evaluate its safety profile.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Sixty patients who underwent complex spine deformity correction between 1 January 2021 and 31 August 2023, were included in this analysis. Radiographic accuracy was evaluated using Gertzbein and Robbins (GR) grading system using intraoperative CT performed in 31 patients (643 screws) and postoperative X-rays performed in all patients (1171 screws). Accurate screw position was designated for GR Grades A and B while Grades C and E were designated as inaccurate placement. Safety of instrumentation was evaluated by recording intraoperative screw malposition, postoperative hardware complications, and reoperations within 90&#x2009;days.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> CT analysis of all screws revealed that screws were accurate to size (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;643, 100%) and length (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;641, 99%). Overall, 96% of screws (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;619 screws) received Grade A, 2% (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;15 screws) received grade B with 98% accurate placement. In 2% of cases (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;9 screws (Grade C&#x2009;=&#x2009;2, Grade D&#x2009;=&#x2009;7), inaccurate screw placement was recorded. A total of two screws were recognized and repositioned intraoperatively. Errors in placement of the guides to patient anatomical landmark were recognized as primary reason all mispositioned screws. In 48% of patients (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;48 patients), adequate clinical placement was achieved and no intraoperative imaging required pre- or post-screw placement. Intraoperative monitoring showed no abnormality in all cohort. All 60 patients showed no postoperative hardware complications. There was no neurological complication. One patient underwent early reoperation due to superficial wound infection.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In complex pediatric spine deformity scenarios, pedicle screw insertion using patient-specific 3D-printed jigs provides safe and accurate technique for pedicle instrumentation. Meticulous attention to the spatial positioning of the jigs in relation to patient anatomical structure is essential for accurate reproduction of the preoperative plan and achieving highest accuracy. In select patients, intraoperative imaging may still be required following placement of screws to objectively evaluate pedicle screw position.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Pedicle screw insertion using patient-specific 3D-printed jigs provides safe and accurate technique for pedicle instrumentation. Meticulous attention to the spatial positioning of the jigs is essential for accurate reproduction of the preoperative plan and achieving highest accuracy.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Studies have shown that longer operative time leads to increased blood loss, increased complications, and possibly infection. A dual-surgeon approach has been shown to decrease operative times and its associated poor outcomes. On the contrary, surgeon volume has been strongly correlated with surgical outcomes. The purpose of this study was to compare outcomes of a high-volume (efficient) surgeon with a dual-surgeon approach and a steady (standard) surgeon.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Retrospective chart review of 484 patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) who underwent a posterior spinal fusion in the years 2017&#x2013;2023. We defined a high-volume surgeon as a surgeon who completed more than 50 cases a year. Clinical, surgical, and radiographic outcomes were collected. Kruskal&#x2013;Wallis test was used for continuous variables and chi-square for categorical variables.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 328 patients were operated on by the efficient surgeon, 72 were operated on by the steady surgeon, and 84 were operated on by dual surgeons. There were no demographic differences among the three groups. Patients from the &#x201C;efficient&#x201D; group achieved significantly more Cobb correction when compared to the steady and dual surgeon patients (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Anesthesia and surgery times were significantly shorter for the efficient surgeon (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001 and p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001, respectively). Complication rates was lower for the efficient surgeon (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.03) as well as decreased transfusions (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.04).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> As seen before, it is common for a surgeon&#x2019;s outcomes to reach a steady state. In comparison to a dual-surgeon team and a steady surgeon, an efficient, high-volume surgeon has better outcomes in terms of OR parameters, fewer complications, and rate of transfusions. When these positive outcomes are multiplied by total number of cases, it amounts to major cost benefits and savings to the institution.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> It is valuable to evaluate how institutions and surgeons can continue to change their outcomes. As seen in previous studies as well as the present one, high-volume is one factor that can change a surgeon&#x2019;s outcome.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> This study aims to retrospectively evaluate the safety profile and the incidence of short-term (6-month) surgical complications associated with robotically assisted pedicle screw placement in a consecutive series of 360 pediatric patients undergoing posterior spinal fusion (PSF) at two tertiary hospitals.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> We retrospectively reviewed 360 consecutive pediatric spinal deformity patients who underwent PSF with the assistance of robotic navigation for placement of pedicle screws at two institutions over 3 years (2020&#x2013;2022). Surgery was performed by three surgeons, and a total of 5525 screws placed utilizing robotic navigation were evaluated. Most of the patients had idiopathic scoliosis (58.1%) (Table 1). Data collection focused on (1) intraoperative surgical complications and (2) 6-month postoperative complications.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Intraoperative complications included one durotomy and four neurological injuries. The durotomy was due to the loss of registration during pedicle drilling, was noted at a depth of 12&#x2009;mm, and was not associated with any neuromonitoring changes or neurological sequelae. The four neurological injuries were unrelated to pedicle screw placement: 3 peripheral nerve compression injuries related to positioning in the operating room (OR), and 1 lumbar plexus stretch injury below the fused/instrumented levels that fully resolved postoperatively without intervention. There were no spinal cord injuries and no vascular injuries. Evaluation of the 360 patients at 6&#x2009;months postoperatively revealed 0.56% (2/360) infections (both deep infections in patients with neuromuscular scoliosis), and 1.1% (4/360) unplanned return to OR (UPROR): 2 deep infection treatments, 1 for screw pull out that was unrecognized intraoperatively and occurred with rod reduction and was revised on POD4, and 1 for nonunion in a heavy smoker, which was revised at 3&#x2009;years postoperatively). 0% neurological injuries related to screw placement, 0.28% (1/360) implant failures, 0.56% (2/360) delayed/non-union, and no deaths.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Robotically assisted pedicle screw placement was performed reliably and safely at two centers by three surgeons in children as young as 7&#x2009;years with an acceptable safety/complication profile and 1.1% (4/360) incidence of UPROR.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> The complication and safety profile of robotically assisted pedicle screw placement compares favorably with the largest published series utilizing freehand screw placement or freehand navigation. Prospective data collection and studies with automated 3D accuracy determination from the SPARTAN registry are forthcoming and will be essential to conclusively prove safety and accuracy of computer-assisted surgical navigation in pediatric spine surgery.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Congenital early-onset scoliosis (EOS) often co-occurs with tethered cord syndrome (TCS), necessitating surgical intervention to address both conditions to prevent worsening neuromuscular function. Detethering can be done concurrently with spinal deformity correction (SDC), be completed prior to SDC, or not done at all. This study explores perioperative complications in EOS patients with and without TCS who underwent SDC with growing instrumentation or fusion.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Data from 751 congenital EOS patients in the Pediatric Spine Study Group registry were analyzed. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 479 patients were divided into groups: those with TCS (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;90) and those without (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;389). Among TCS patients, some had detethering (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;61), while others did not (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;29). Demographics, MRI findings, treatment history, and surgical complications were assessed. Demographics, MRI findings, treatment history, and surgical complications were assessed, including intraoperative and postoperative complications.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> There were no significant differences in the age (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.45) or pre-index major Cobb angles (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.26) between the detethered and not detethered cohorts. Patients with TCS and no detethering procedure had higher rates of general postoperative complications (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.007) and hardware failure (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.005). No significant differences were observed between groups for intraoperative complications (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.93), infections (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.75), and neurological complications (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.72). When comparing the EOS patients with and without TCS, there were no significant differences in age (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.83) or pre-index major Cobb angle (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.20). In addition, there were no significant differences in intraoperative complication (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.055), general postoperative complications (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.41), hardware failure (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.060), infections (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.25), and neurological complications (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.54).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> No significant differences were observed in intraoperative complications, general postoperative complications, hardware failure, infections, and neurological complications between EOS patients with and without TCS. Significantly, EOS patients with TCS who underwent detethering exhibited lower rates of general postoperative complications and hardware failure during SDC with growing instrumentation or fusion. These findings support detethering as a valuable strategy to reduce complications in EOS patients with TCS.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This study underscores the importance of detethering in EOS patients with concurrent TCS. It demonstrates that detethering may substantially mitigate the risk of general postoperative complications and hardware failure during SDC with growing instrumentation or fusion. These insights advocate for individualized treatment decisions, emphasizing the potential benefits of detethering in enhancing surgical outcomes for this patient population.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Patients who present to clinic with primary complaint of back pain are complicated and take significant clinic time. Surgery is often not indicated. The purpose of this study is to examine the incidence of patients presenting to orthopedics with primary complaint of back pain, identify patient characteristics and potential contributing factors.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved, single-institution, retrospective review was completed on all patients, ages 7&#x2013;22&#x2009;years presenting to pediatric orthopedic clinic with primary complaint of back pain in 2021. Demographics, medications, pain scores, anxiety, depression, and other relevant factors were collected. Descriptive and non-parametric statistics were used (a&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05).</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 371 charts were reviewed. Around 302 met inclusion criteria (age: 14.5&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;3.1&#x2009;years, body mass index (BMI): 24.2&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;6.9). Patients are primarily white (72%), female (61%), teenagers (62%), who are privately insured (60%). Visual analog pain scores (max 10) prior to clinical exam were 3.7&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;2.9. 80% presented with lumbar pain, 21% reported thoracic pain, without injury (89%). Radiating symptoms were reported in 12%. Differential imaging included MRI in 24% of patients. About 50% were found to have an underlying spine condition that could cause pain including 30% scoliosis, 13% spondy, 2% vertebral fracture/injury, 2% Bertolotti&#x2019;s syndrome. Around 49% had a behavioral health diagnosis, including 31% with depression, 38% anxiety disorder(s), 19% ADHD, 13% undefined behavioral concerns, 4% autism, and 15% had history of suicidal ideation. About 24% were previously prescribed antidepressants, 32% were involved in counseling, and 7% had acute psychiatric admissions. Around 69% of patients had no planned follow-up visit. About 72% of patients were referred to physical therapy. Anti-inflammatory medication was prescribed for 20%, muscle relaxers for 2%. About 32% were given a lumbar corset/brace. About 8% were referred to psychology. There were no significant differences in symptoms or behavioral health in patients with and without an underlying spine diagnosis (Table 1); however, pain scores were slightly higher in those without.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Back pain in pediatrics is complicated and generally does not yield positive radiographic findings. Nearly 400 patients with back pain presented in 1 year, most were privately insured, White females, with lumbar pain. While 49% had recorded behavioral health diagnoses, this does not account for those who are undiagnosed or have care elsewhere. It is unclear if unspecified back pain is a potential symptom of other mental health condition and/or if back pain exacerbates pre-morbid stress and mood challenges.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Pediatric back pain is a complex problem, requiring biopsychosocial, and interdisciplinary coordinated intervention. Current care models are expensive and linear, leading to surgeon and patient frustration.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Accurate assessment of spinopelvic sagittal parameters is essential for evaluating spinal deformities and planning surgical intervention in pediatric patients. This study aimed to establish normative values for spinopelvic alignment in children and adolescents while exploring age, sex, and body mass index (BMI) influences.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Utilizing a substantial cohort of 10,969 patients who underwent pelvic computed tomography (CT) scans between 2012 and 2022, we applied validated custom software for automated measurements of pelvic incidence (PI), sacral slope (SS), and pelvic tilt (PT). A validated custom software (VirtualHip) was used to automatically segment the femur, pelvis, and sacrum, and to measure PI, SS, and PT. Linear models with pairwise comparisons (multiple t-tests with Bonferroni post hoc) were used to investigate the effect of age on quantified features to conduct comparisons between males and females (after adjusting for BMI percentile), and normal weight (5th&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;BMI&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;85th percentile) and obese (BMI&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;95th percentile), after adjusting for sex.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> We noted a significant age-related decrease in PI and PT after adjusting for sex and BMI percentile. PI showed a negative association with age (&#x3B2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;&#x2013;1.68, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Females had lower PI compared to males (difference&#x2009;=&#x2009;&#x2013;0.51&#xB0;, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.006), after adjusting for age and BMI. Sacral slope also demonstrated a small but significant decrease with age (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). In contrast to pelvic incidence and tilt, sex was not a significant predictor of sacral slope after adjusting for age and BMI (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.5). Obesity was not a significant predictor of PI (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.07). However, obese patients had lower PT compared to non-obese after controlling for age and sex (b&#x2009;=&#x2009;&#x2013;0.72&#xB0;, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). No significant differences in sacral slope were observed between BMI groups when accounting for age and sex (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.4).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In conclusion, this study provides a comprehensive evaluation of spinopelvic alignment in a pediatric population. It underscores the significant age-related changes in pelvic incidence and tilt, with females demonstrating lower pelvic incidence. In addition, BMI appears to play a role in pelvic tilt. These normative data and age-related trends in spinopelvic alignment parameters offer valuable insights for clinical decision-making in pediatric spinal disorders and surgical planning.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> The normative data about spinopelvic sagittal alignment during growth provided in this study will help future research in spinal deformity pathomechanics, including spondylolisthesis. Further our automated 3D-CT methodology may be help in the design of patient-specific implants.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> The Sanders Maturation Stage (SMS) 7 generally denotes the cessation of spinal growth and minimal scoliosis progression. However, some patients continue to exhibit scoliosis progression post SMS 7. While SMS 7 has been subdivided into stages 7A and 7B, the distinct growth potentials of these subtypes remain underexplored. This study aimed to clarify the differences in spine and total body height growth, as well as curve progression, between SMS 7A and 7B in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) patients.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> This retrospective case-control study involved AIS patients at the SMS 7 stage from January 2013 to September 2021. We included patients who were followed for at least 2 years or until reaching Risser stage 5. This study evaluated the differential gains in the spine (T1S1) and total body height, as well as the curve progression between SMS 7A and 7B. A validated formula was used to calculate the corrected height, accounting for height loss due to scoliosis. A multivariable non-linear regression model was applied to assess the distinct growth and curve progression patterns between the SMS 7 subtypes, adjusting for potential confounders. A multivariate logistic regression model evaluated the impact of SMS 7 subtypes on curve progression over 10&#xB0;.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 231 AIS patients (83% girls, mean age 13.9&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1.2&#x2009;years) were included, with a follow-up averaging 3.0&#x2009;years. Patients at SMS 7A exhibited larger gains in spine height (9.9&#x2009;mm vs 6.3&#x2009;mm, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) and total body height (19.8&#x2009;mm vs 13.4&#x2009;mm, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) compared to those at SMS 7B. These findings remained consistent even after adjustments for curve magnitude. Non-linear regression models showed continued spine and total body height increases plateauing after 2 years, significantly more in SMS 7A (see Figures). No significant difference in curve progression between the subtypes was observed (4.8&#xB0; vs 3.5&#xB0;, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.103), though more SMS 7A patients had curve progression over 10&#xB0; (18% vs 7%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.020), with an adjusted odds ratio of 3.31 (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.015).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This study revealed that patients staged SMS 7A exhibited higher spine and total body growth and a greater incidence of substantial curve progression than those at 7B. These findings imply that delaying brace discontinuation until reaching 7B could be beneficial, particularly for those with larger curves.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This study highlighted subtle but significant growth potential between SMS 7A and 7B, suggesting that a tailored approach to brace discontinuation could optimize patient outcomes.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Neuromuscular early-onset scoliosis (EOS) often presents with a long sweeping thoracolumbar scoliosis and pelvic obliquity. Concurrent truncal weakness results in concave ribs resting on the high side of the oblique pelvis (rib-on-pelvis deformity), which may result in costo-iliac impingement (pain associated with rib-on-pelvis deformity). Rib-on-pelvis deformity (ROP) can also affect diaphragmatic excursion and sitting balance. Literature is limited regarding pain in the setting of ROP. The study goal was to evaluate whether patients with ROP have more reported pain before surgery and a greater improvement in pain after surgery.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A multicenter international registry was queried for all non-ambulatory patients with neuromuscular EOS treated operatively with at least 2-year follow-up from 2012 to 2021. The Early-Onset Scoliosis 24-Item Questionnaire (EOSQ-24) has two questions using 5-point Likert-type scales pertaining to frequency and severity of pain. These were used to assess pain at pre-operative, immediate post-operative, and 2-year post-operative timepoints. ROP&#x2014;defined as having a rib distal to the superior portion of the iliac crest&#x2014;was classified as a binary assessment based on pre-index procedure upright radiographs. The ROP cohort and control cohort without ROP deformity were compared regarding pain frequency and severity. Statistical analysis was performed using paired-samples Wilcoxon test.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> After exclusion of patients lacking radiographs or EOSQ-24 scores, 107 patients met inclusion criteria. About 52 were male (49%) and 55 were female (51%). The mean age was 8.1&#x2009;years, mean coronal Cobb angle was 70.0&#xB0;, and mean pre-index procedure pelvic obliquity was 22.3&#xB0;. About 44 patients (41%) had ROP while 63 control patients (59%) did not. ROP was associated with both pain severity (mean 3.32 vs 3.93, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01) and frequency (mean 3.07 vs 3.79, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002) pre-index procedure, compared to controls. Patients with ROP who had surgical intervention had a higher reduction in both pain severity (mean improved 0.99 vs &#x2013;0.06 points, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01) and frequency (mean improved 0.78 vs 0.07 points, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01) 2&#x2009;years post-operatively in comparison to those without ROP.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Neuromuscular EOS patients with ROP deformity experience more pain than patients without this deformity. Furthermore, these patients experienced a greater reduction in pain after surgery measured via the EOSQ-24 questionnaire.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> ROP deformity in neuromuscular EOS patients is associated with pain but responds positively to surgical intervention.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> EOSQ-24 is validated in EOS patients aged 0&#x2013;18&#x2009;years, and SRS-22 is validated in idiopathic scoliosis patients &#x2265;10&#x2009;years. EOSQ-24 is completed by the parent, and SRS-22 is completed by the patient. A prior study comparing patient-reported outcome measures completed by older pediatric patients, and their parents showed a low level of agreement. The aims of this study were (1) compare EOSQ-24 and SRS-22 scores completed at the same timepoint and (2) compare EOSQ-24 and SRS-22 scores completed at subsequent timepoints, in patients aged 5&#x2013;18&#x2009;years with idiopathic or congenital scoliosis without developmental delay.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> This was a multicenter retrospective study. We identified pairs of EOSQ-24 and SRS-22 completed on the same day or within 6&#x2009;months. Some patients had multiple pairs of surveys over time. EOSQ-24 and SRS-22 questions were matched using previously published methodology and domain scores for Pain, Function, Mental Health, and Satisfaction were compared. Patients with a change in treatment between completed surveys were excluded. Pearson correlation test was used to compare EOSQ-24 and SRS-22 domain scores, with r&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.7 indicating a strong relationship.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 411 pairs of EOSQ-24 and SRS-22 were completed on the same day by 228 patients (Table 1). A strong correlation was found only for the Pain domain (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.77). Function, Mental Health, and Satisfaction domains had positive but not strong correlations (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.58, r&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.50, r&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.41, respectively). Sub-analysis based on age also showed a strong correlation only for Pain (Table 2). There were 134 pairs of surveys with SRS-22 completed within 6&#x2009;months after an EOSQ-24 by 76 patients (Table 1). All domains demonstrated a positive but not strong correlation, with Pain showing the highest correlation (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.64).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> EOSQ-24 and SRS-22 had a strong correlation only for the Pain domain when completed at the same timepoint. EOSQ-24 and SRS-22 completed within 6&#x2009;months lacked a strong correlation for all domains. Our findings suggest that parents and older children with EOS may not share the same perspective on their health. Self-reported questionnaires may be more appropriate instruments to assess HRQoL in older, developmentally neurotypical patients with EOS. Future studies should further investigate how to compare proxy measures and self-reported outcome measures, as children with EOS develop cognitively with age and transition from parent-reported to self-reported questionnaires.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Parents and children may not share the same perspective on their health. Self-reported questionnaires should be used, when possible, to assess HRQoL in older children and adolescents with EOS.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Vertebral body tethering (VBT) is a novel technique for spinal growth modulation for select patients with idiopathic scoliosis. Following tether application, asymmetric growth of the vertebral bodies allows for curve correction. Although tether ruptures are common, early tether ruptures are thought to result in greater clinical importance, as the remodeling process is ongoing at this stage. It is not well-understood how rupture influences vertebra remodeling nor which pre-index demographic and morphologic parameters correlate with rupture. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of ruptures on morphologic spine changes and to identify risk factors for rupture.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A multicenter pediatric spine registry was queried for patients with juvenile or adolescent idiopathic scoliosis treated with VBT. Excluded if &lt;2-year follow-up, prior spine surgery, or revision prior to 2-year follow-up. Tether ruptures were identified using criteria of &gt;5&#xB0; increase in screw angle at any level between post-op and 2-year radiographs. De-identified, calibrated biplanar radiographs underwent 3D reconstruction. Morphologic measurements of individual vertebra and disks was obtained through a custom MATLAB script.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Fifty VBT patients with 300 instrumented disk-spaces were identified, of which 14 (4.7%) segments in 14 (28%) individual patients had a tether rupture prior to 2-year radiograph. Demographics were similar with no difference in gender, race, maturity indices, curve flexibility, or segmental tension applied between the rupture and no-rupture groups. Segments with a suspected tether rupture occurred in taller patients (157.9 vs 153.3&#x2009;cm, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.031) and were more likely located at the caudal end of instrumentation with 57% occurring at T10T11 (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.003). Ruptured segments had higher pre-index posterior vertebral body height (18.6 vs 16.7&#x2009;mm, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.011) and convex vertebral body height (19.3 vs 17.8&#x2009;mm, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.016), without differences in disk morphology. Postoperative 2-year radiographs demonstrated that ruptured segments had significant worsening of segmental Cobb (&#x2013;7.7&#xB0; vs 2.2&#xB0;; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001, Figure 1) owing to increased convex vertebral body growth (2.29 vs 1.04&#x2009;mm, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.006) and a larger decrease in concave disk height (&#x2013;1.64 vs &#x2013;0.11&#x2009;mm; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.022).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Patients with suspected tether rupture demonstrated a large decrease in segmental Cobb correction (growth modulation) primarily due to increased convex vertebra growth. Taller patients, more caudal levels of instrumentation, and larger pre-index posterior and convex vertebra heights are risk factors for early tether rupture.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Early tether ruptures occurred in 4.7% of segments and lead to loss of correction instead of growth modulation. Patient selection is critical to avoid this outcome.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> The invasiveness of posterior spine fusion (PSF) poses challenges in managing postoperative pain while minimizing opioid use. Subcutaneous bupivacaine infusions (SQBI) offer a potential solution, improving patient comfort, early mobilization, and efficient discharge, all while reducing opioid reliance. However, prior studies lacked adequate controls for catheter depth and only focused on adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) patients. In our institution, one pediatric spine surgeon utilizes SQBI after PSF while another does not. All other aspects of postoperative multimodal pain regimens remain consistent. This study aims to look at the utilization of SQBI in two groups undergoing identical surgeries, one with SQBI and the other without. We hypothesized that pediatric patients receiving continuous postoperative SQBI after undergoing PSF for AIS or neuromuscular scoliosis (NMS) would have improved pain scores and reduced inpatient opioid consumption.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> We conducted a comprehensive chart review of patients who underwent PSF by two pediatric spine surgeons between 2015 and 2021. Inclusion criteria comprised patients aged 10&#x2013;18 undergoing PSF for AIS or NMS. Exclusions included non-fusion procedures, congenital scoliosis cases, and patients contraindicated for patient-controlled analgesia (PCA). We quantified inpatient opioid consumption using morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs) and assessed pain scores using a 0&#x2013;10 visual analog scale. The primary outcome measure was inpatient MME usage, and secondary outcomes included mean pain scores and hospital length of stay (LOS).</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Of the 205 patients meeting inclusion criteria, 103 received SQBI catheters, while 102 did not. The SQBI group exhibited a significant reduction of 37.4&#x2009;mg in MME usage (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01) and achieved a shorter median LOS by 1&#x2009;day (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01). While there was no difference in MME use within the NMS subgroup, the AIS subgroup demonstrated lower mean MME use of 43.4&#x2009;mg (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.03). Pain scores remained consistently low across comparisons without significant differences. To control for outlier extended hospital stays, subgroup analysis for patients with LOS&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;10&#x2009;days did not reveal substantial variations compared to the overall population.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our findings underscore the potential benefits of postoperative subcutaneous bupivacaine catheter use in pediatric spine fusion surgeries. This approach reduces opioid consumption and facilitates shorter hospital stays. These results emphasize the promise of SQBI as an effective pain management strategy.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This study&#x2019;s significance lies in its potential to improve the postoperative experience of AIS/NMS patients by reducing opioid consumption, shortening hospital stays, and enhancing overall patient care. It contributes to the search for safer alternatives pain regimen after pediatric spine surgery.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Anterior vertebral body tethering (AVBT) is a fusionless technique used to treat idiopathic scoliosis (IS) in skeletally immature patients. This study evaluates AVBT survivorship and trends over time as techniques evolve.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Patients undergoing thoracic AVBT for IS with 2- to 8-year follow-up were included. Survivorship was analyzed according to two different events of interest: (1) revision to posterior spinal fusion (PSF) or a major curve &gt;50&#xB0; at final follow-up and (2) a major curve &gt;35&#xB0; at final follow-up. Survivorship was plotted according to Kaplan&#x2013;Meier. Patient characteristics and survivorship were compared between an earlier (2012&#x2013;2015) and a later cohort (2016&#x2013;2018).</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> There were 262 patients (early 81, late 181). Twenty-nine patients developed a major curve &gt;50&#xB0; or had a PSF. No differences were observed between the early and late cohorts for preoperative thoracic coronal deformity (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.2) or age (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.1). More patients had open TRC in the early cohort (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). The cumulative proportion of survival for PSF/&gt;50&#xB0; was ~98% at 2&#x2009;years and 65% at 6&#x2009;years; and for the &gt;35&#xB0; threshold was 78% at 2&#x2009;years and 58% at 6&#x2009;years. For PSF/&gt;50&#xB0;, there was no significant difference in survivorship between early/late cohorts (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.9). For &gt;35&#xB0;, there was significantly higher survivorship in the later cohort (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.034). Patients with a curve&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;35&#xB0; at final follow-up were more likely to have smaller preoperative curves, as well as smaller curves and greater curve correction at first erect.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Long-term survival of thoracic AVBT for cases prior to 2018 can be expected for ~65% of patients. Survivorship at 2&#x2009;years was high and decreased in subsequent years. There was no difference in AVBT survival between the early and late cohorts for avoiding PSF or &gt;50&#xB0;, but there was increased survival for avoiding progression &gt;35&#xB0; in the later cohort. Smaller preoperative curves, smaller curves, and greater curve correction at first erect were seen in successful cases. Follow-up to maturity is needed post-AVBT.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> With AVBT being a relatively new surgical treatment for IS, it is important to study longer-term outcomes to understand the risks/benefits of the procedure. In this study, survival following AVBT was analyzed in an early and late cohort of patients. In terms of major failures (i.e. PSF or &gt;50&#xB0;), the survivorship of AVBT has not significantly changed over the past 10&#x2009;years. However, with refined indications and techniques, survivorship has improved based on the &gt;35&#xB0; failure threshold with the more &#x201C;successful&#x201D; cases having smaller preoperative curves and greater curve correction.</p>

        <title>Hip pain after spinopelvic fixation with sacral alar iliac screws in pediatric neuromuscular scoliosis</title>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> People with neuromuscular conditions often have thoracolumbar scoliosis, pelvic obliquity, and hip subluxation or dislocation. Spinopelvic fixation with sacral alar iliac (SAI) screws is generally accepted for better construct stability and lower surgical complication in scoliosis and pelvic obliquity correction. However, little was known regarding the influence of spinopelvic fixation with SAI screws on hip status. This study aims to describe the hip outcome after spinopelvic fixation and determine the risk factors for postoperative hip pain.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective review was conducted on pediatric neuromuscular patients who underwent spinopelvic fixation with SAI screws and had more than 1.5&#x2009;years of follow-up from 2013 to 2021. Radiography results and electrical medical records were assessed. The Cox regression analysis, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, and Kaplan&#x2013;Meier survival were conducted to explore the risk factors of newly developed or worsened postoperative hip pain.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Eighty-two patients underwent spine surgery at an average age of 12.6&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;2.2&#x2009;years. Of them, 41 (50%) had hip bony surgery before their spinal surgery. Twenty-four (29.2%) of them reported hip pain after surgery. Thirteen patients had pain in both hips. Three patients received femoral head surgery to alleviate hip pain, one underwent acetabulum osteotomy, and three received intra-articular steroid injections after spine surgery. Cox regression analysis revealed that postoperative pelvic obliquity (PO) was positively associated with postoperative hip pain (hazard ratio: 1.15, 95% confidence interval: 1.053&#x2013;1.259, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002). The optimal cutoff point of postoperative PO&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;4.5&#xB0;was obtained from ROC analysis (area under curve&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.704, sensitivity&#x2009;=&#x2009;60.0%, specificity&#x2009;=&#x2009;80.4%). The overall hip pain-free time was significantly longer in patients with postoperative PO&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;4.5&#xB0; (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.02, log-rank test).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Neuromuscular scoliosis patients could still sustain hip pain despite the spinal and pelvic deformity being well corrected and maintained through spinopelvic fixation with SAI screws. The etiology of postoperative hip pain could be multifactorial, but we found residual PO deformity is one of the risk factors.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Due to communication challenges, medical complexity, and retrospective study design, hip pain may be underestimated in neuromuscular scoliosis patients. The strength of this study is the relatively large patient numbers, which provide radiographic and clinical outcomes of the hip after spinopelvic fixation with SAI screws. Awareness of the possibility of further hip surgery and preserving the space for acetabulum osteotomy by modifying the SAI screw trajectory and length may optimize the functional outcome.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Patients with neuromuscular diseases (NMDs) often present with early-onset scoliosis (EOS). Surgical interventions have demonstrated an increase in survival and improved quality of life; however, correcting the spinal deformity may have limited impact on ameliorating the multitude of co-morbidities associated with NMD. This study aims to (1) evaluate the impact of comorbidities on mortality, (2) examine effect of NMD diagnosis, preoperative coronal and sagittal curves, age at surgery, and extent of curve correction on modifying or interacting with the effect of comorbidities on mortality.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> This was a retrospective cohort study of NMD patients with EOS who underwent spinal surgery from 1995 to 2021 with 1-year of postoperative follow-up. Mortality risk was calculated at the 1, 2, 5, and 10&#x2009;years. Hazard ratio was calculated for unequal follow-up and time to death. Interaction terms were included. Stratified analyses determined covariates as confounders or effect modifiers. Sensitivity analyses confirmed all patients, and those who were lost to follow-up were similar, indicating limited threat of selection bias.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 889 patients were identified: 38% cerebral palsy (CP), 24% spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), 12% myelodysplasia, 13% muscular dystrophy (MD), and 4% myopathy. Co-morbidities were 48% gastrointestinal (GI), 42% neurologic, 41% musculoskeletal, 38% developmental delay, 37% pulmonary, 11% cardiac, 7% renal, 4% blood or connective tissue, and 2% endocrine. Mortality was 1.2% at 1&#x2009;year, 5.1% at 2&#x2009;years, 10.6% at 5&#x2009;years, and 32.0% at 10&#x2009;years. When stratified by diagnosis, co-morbidity interactions increased mortality (Table): in particular cardiac&#x2009;+&#x2009;pulmonary (13.7&#xD7; in SMA) or cardiac&#x2009;+&#x2009;GI (30.7&#xD7; in SMA and 34.7&#xD7; myelodysplasia). Multiple comorbidities increased the death rate in EOS children compared to those without comorbidities or NMD patients with only one comorbidity (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). Deformity correction did not mitigate mortality rate.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Increased rates of mortality after surgery were associated with NMD entities and related co-morbidities, independent of the extent of spine deformity correction. While CP was the dominant diagnosis contributing to premature death, increased risk of death could not be identified for any of the comorbidities. While spinal pathoanatomy may exacerbate certain comorbidities (especially cardiopulmonary), these results indicate that the surgical treatment of EOS may have limited influence on ameliorating disease-specific pathophysiologic processes that threaten the health and well-being of NMD patients.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> The knowledge gained from the work will enhance shared decision-making, improve the way we manage EOS in NMD patients, and aide clinical practice to mitigate the occurrence of death by identifying high-risk patients.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Intraoperative neuromonitoring is the standard of care during pediatric spinal deformity correction procedures. A combination of somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP), transcranial motor evoked potentials (TcMEP), and electromyography (EMG) are used to monitor spinal cord function intraoperatively. Neuromonitoring &#x201C;alerts&#x201D; are announced in the operating room when the nerve signal amplitude is decreased, or latency is prolonged from the baseline preoperative nerve signal set for each patient. A standardized neuromonitoring alert protocol is followed to take corrective action when an alert warns of impending spinal cord injury. This single-center study seeks to determine the rate of neuromonitoring alerts during posterior spinal fusion in pediatric patients and characterize the corrective measures taken.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Patients undergoing posterior spinal fusion at Nemour&#x2019;s Childrens Hospital (NCH) in Orlando, FL between 2015 and 2020 were identified and the 1000 cases were randomly screened. Patient characteristics, intraoperative data, and postoperative clinical data were reviewed. Secondary outcomes examined included correctional actions taken during alerts and the incidence of postoperative neurological dysfunction. Around 97 patients were excluded due to a lack of documented neuromonitoring.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 903 patients (33.9% male/66.1% female) met inclusion criteria. The mean age at surgery was 13.94&#x2009;years (SD 3.41&#x2009;year). There were 64 total neuromonitoring alerts (7.08%), including 4 EMG, 6 SSEP, and 54 TcMEP attenuation of baseline signals. Intraoperatively, neuromonitoring alerts were resolved with the following interventions: no intervention (22), repositioning (8), hardware adjustment (15), and blood pressure adjustment (15). Although four patients did not recover signals intraoperatively, they exhibited normal wake-up tests. No patients developed postoperative neurological deficits, regardless of neuromonitoring status.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The rate of neuromonitoring alerts was 7.08% with no postoperative neurologic deficits in this study. Similar studies at Shriners Hospital for Children in Philadelphia and the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto showed 9.1% and 27.8% neuromonitoring changes, respectively, in their single-center reviews. These differences may be attributable to patient characteristics, surgeon experience, or different neuromonitoring alert threshold settings. This study also characterizes the heterogeneous corrective action types taken in response to alerts. Future research may analyze demographic or surgical factors that predispose certain pediatric patients to increased risk of neuromonitoring alters to better inform surgical preparation and tailored therapy.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Our study will add to the body of literature by informing centers of neuromonitoring alert rates and types of corrective action interventions utilized to achieve zero postoperative neurological deficits in a study of 903 pediatric posterior spinal fusion patients.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> In 2013, the BrAIST trial published in the <italic toggle="yes">New England Journal of Medicine</italic> (NEJM) was the first RCT to demonstrate the efficacy of bracing in preventing progression to surgical intervention in AIS. Despite the impact of this study, limited research has investigated whether it influenced the rates of spinal fusion for AIS, specifically among different sociodemographic groups. Previous studies have reported inequities in the utilization of conservative bracing among patients of different race and insurance payers. The primary aim of this study was to examine potential differences in the rate of spinal fusion in AIS before and after the publication of the BrAIST trial, using a national hospital database.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> This study utilized the Kid&#x2019;s Inpatient Database (KID) to identify a cohort of AIS patients who underwent spinal fusion between 2003 and 2019 (divided into 3-year periods). US Census data were used to estimate national fusion rates for each 3-year period and for different sociodemographic groups. Resulting rates were plotted by 3-year time periods, and patterns were observed graphically. Interrupted time series models were used to test differences in intercepts and slopes (&#x3B2;) before and after the BrAIST study was published in 2013.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 28,523 patients were included in the analysis. There was a statistically significant difference in fusion rates between racial groups with respect to both slope (rate across timepoints) and intercept (total number of spinal fusions/100,000 patients). Among White patients, the intercept (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) and slope (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) both significantly decreased after 2013. Among Black patients, there was a significant decrease in intercept (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), but no significant change in slope (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.06) after 2013. No significant changes were observed among Hispanic or Asian patients. Comparing insurances, the intercept among patients with private (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) and Medicare/Medicaid (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) insurance significantly decreased; however, the same was not seen among self-pay patients (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.94).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Following BrAIST trial publication, fusion rates significantly decreased between 2014 and 2016, suggesting an impact from the trial&#x2019;s results and conclusions regarding the efficacy of bracing for AIS, which were prominently reported in the NEJM. Sociodemographic inequities were evident, with the potential impact of BrAIST&#x2019;s publication not demonstrated in Black patients or self-pay patients.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> These findings highlight the potential impact of high-profile publications, although only select populations. Future studies must consider implementation and dissemination of research findings to ensure that reported benefits are shared among patients of all sociodemographic backgrounds to promote equitable care.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Selection of the lowest instrumented vertebra (LIV) is still a widely debated topic in thoracic adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). Regardless of the LIV selection method, a notable distal adding-on rate has been reported. The main purpose of this study was to report the results of an original technique of LIV selection in thoracic AIS based on disk mobility analysis in frontal and sagittal bending films derived from the Cotrel&#x2013;Dubousset original technique of LIV selection. The secondary objective was to analyze the correlation between the pre-operative sagittal range of motion of the disk below the LIV and the adding-on rate.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> We report 100 cases of thoracic AIS who underwent posterior spinal fusion (PSF) with a minimum of 2&#x2009;years follow-up. Intra- and inter-observer reproducibility was tested. The mean age was 14.76&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;2.19&#x2009;years. The mean follow-up durations were 3.85&#x2009;years. Patients were divided into two groups depending on the appearance of distal adding-on according to the Wang criteria.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> The mean preoperative Cobb angle of the thoracic curve was 60.64&#xB0;&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;11.41&#xB0;. The mean postoperative Cobb angle was 23.60&#xB0;&#xB1;&#x2009;8.00&#xB0;. Adding-on rate was 12%. A lower sagittal range of motion of the disk below the LIV (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.009), lower Risser stage (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.024), and higher male sex ratio (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.007) were observed in the adding-on group. Multivariate analysis revealed an association between the sagittal range of motion of the disk below the LIV and the adding-on risk (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.28; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.04). This method of LIV selection allowed us to save one vertebra level in more of 40% of the patients comparing to the last touched vertebra (LTV) selection method.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The modified Cotrel&#x2013;Dubousset method including the disk mobility in the sagittal plane is associated with a good success rate on adding-on prevention.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Level 3: retrospective study.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Appropriate selection of the lowest instrumented vertebra (LIV) is crucial to ensure positive outcomes after surgical management of patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). Preservation of motion segments is believed to be beneficial for preserving motion and preventing degeneration of unfused lumbar spine; thus, a positive impact on a patient&#x2019;s quality of life. PROMIS (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System) is becoming a commonly utilized patient-reported outcome measure in orthopedic surgery. The objective of this study was to determine whether the LIV is associated with changes in PROMIS scores in patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) and to evaluate for correlations with SRS-22.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> This was a retrospective, multi-center analysis of electronic medical record (EMR) data from a nationwide pediatric orthopedic healthcare system. A set of patients who had undergone primary posterior spinal fusion for AIS from January 2011 to January 2023 was queried. This dataset was further filtered to include only patients who had a PROMIS or SRS-22 score documented both before and after surgery. PROMIS survey scores (mobility, pain, peer relationships, upper extremity), SRS-22 survey scores (function, mental health, pain, satisfaction, self-image, total), clinical dates, sex, and LIV were collected from the EMR.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> The study cohort consisted of 348 patients with PROMIS data and 341 patients with SRS-22 data. Clinical significance was defined as a difference of more than 10 points for PROMIS. For SRS-22, clinical significance for each of the subscales were: pain 0.6, function 0.3, image 1.3, mental health 0.3, and total 0.6. There were no clinically significant differences in PROMIS scores with LIV. Similarly, there was no clinically significant differences in SRS scores with LIV.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This is one of the biggest cohorts that has been studied to evaluate how LIV impacts quality of life. It is also the first to use PROMIS scores in this population, a measure that covers a wide spectrum of health domains including physical, mental, and social health. We demonstrate that at multiple time points up to two years postoperatively, LIV for AIS PSF is not correlated with PROMIS or SRS-22 scores.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> In this study, LIV for AIS was not correlated with PROMIS or SRS-22 scores at 2&#x2009;years. This study sets the groundwork for establishing the baseline values for this cohort of patients. Longer-term follow-up will be necessary to differentiate whether patients&#x2019; outcomes will be affected by LIV.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Return to the hospital following surgery is commonly used as a quality metric. This study aims to determine the causes and risk factors for emergency department (ED) visits within 90&#x2009;days of spinal deformity surgery.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A review of spinal deformity operations from 2011 to 2022 was carried out. Radiographic, surgical, and hospital stay information was collected. Kruskal&#x2013;Wallis test was used for continuous data, and chi-square was used for categorical. Patients who returned to the ED within 90&#x2009;days for any reason were analyzed. ED appointments were classified as either medical or surgical. Medical visits included but not limited to fever, pain, and seizures. Surgical visits included wound and surgical site infections but were not limited to these conditions.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 694 patients were included in the study. Around 86 patients returned to the ED within 90&#x2009;days and 608 did not. Of the returns to the ED, 61 (70.9%) returned for medical reasons while 25 (29.1%) returned for surgical reasons. Those who returned to the ED had greater total hospital stay morphine consumption (3.61 vs 2.86, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.015) and greater initial length of stay (5 vs 4, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001). Patients who experienced hospital stay complications, spent three or more days in the ICU, or those who were not extubated in the operating room were more likely to revisit the ED (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.005, and p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.012, respectively). Patients who took 0&#x2009;days to achieve out-of-bed activity revisited the ED more than those who took 1 or more days (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Patients with neuromuscular scoliosis (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;87) were significantly more likely to return to the ED than those without (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Logistic regression again showed that patients with neuromuscular scoliosis were more likely to visit the ED within 90&#x2009;days (odds ratio (OR): 2.83, 95% confidence interval (CI):1.16&#x2013;0.90, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.022) as well as those who experienced hospital stay complications (OR: 3.62, CI: 1.79&#x2013;7.33, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Within 90&#x2009;days, 14.1% of patients returned to the ED, primarily with medical complaints. Patients were more likely to return to the ED if they had longer LOS, achieved OOB quicker, and had greater morphine consumption. In addition, neuromuscular scoliosis and hospital stay complications are independent risk factors that significantly increase the likelihood of return to ED.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Return to the ED remains a quality indicator in healthcare. This study aimed to characterize a single institution&#x2019;s experience with ED visits following spinal deformity surgery.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Documented rates of neural axis abnormalities in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) patients receiving surgical intervention range from 8% to 34.5%. Few studies have analyzed the rate of patients with abnormal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings who undergo neurosurgical intervention, with rates ranging from 0% to 55%. Our study analyzes a larger cohort of patients with AIS who had MRI scans prior to surgery to determine the rates of neural axis abnormalities, neurosurgical consultation, neurosurgical intervention, and to assess risk factors for positive findings based on demographic or radiographic characteristics.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> After obtaining IRB approval, a retrospective review of a prospectively collected AIS operative database was performed to identify patients with AIS who had MRI scans prior to surgical interventions that occurred from 2015 to 2022. Charts were reviewed to capture neural axis abnormalities, neurosurgical consultations, and neurosurgical interventions. Patients were excluded if they were &lt;age 10 or had incomplete radiographic data. All neural axis abnormalities and actual diagnoses of Chiari malformation or syrinx were analyzed for variances in age, sex, main curve size, main curve flexibility, apex-left main thoracic curves, thoracic kyphosis magnitude, and intraoperative neuromonitoring (IOMN) changes during surgery.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 431 of 439 (97.3%) AIS patients undergoing surgery had preoperative MRI scans. Around 173 were excluded for incomplete radiographic data, leaving 258 for analysis. About 33 (12.8%) had any neural axis abnormality identified by MRI scan. Twelve (4.7%) had a Chiari malformation or syrinx, all of whom received neurosurgical consultation. One patient (8.3% of patients with a Chiari or syrinx, 0.39% of the entire cohort) required neurosurgical intervention prior to spine surgery. The presence of any neural axis abnormality on MRI scan and the presence of a syrinx of Chiari malformation had no significant correlation with age, sex, curve size, curve flexibility, apex-left main thoracic curves, main curve location, thoracic kyphosis, or IOMN changes (p&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.05 for all).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Rates of identification of any neural axis abnormality and Chiari or syrinx malformations in AIS patients undergoing surgery was substantial, but the need for neurosurgical intervention was low. Demographic and radiographic factors were not predictive of positive MRI findings. Positive MRI findings were not predictive of IONM changes.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Our study provides insight into the rates at which patients with presumed AIS requiring surgery have neural axis abnormalities versus the rate at which these abnormalities require neurosurgical intervention or cause IONM changes. Preoperative MRI scans should be considered for patients with AIS scheduled for surgical intervention.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Neuromuscular scoliosis (NMS) patients undergoing posterior spinal fusion (PSF) are at high risk for surgical complication, so multidisciplinary involvement is essential. A comprehensive perioperative pathway for high-risk patients was implemented to optimize patients preoperatively and standardize care. This study evaluates the effect of the high-risk pathway on patient outcomes, intensive care unit (ICU) utilization, hospital length of stay, and complications.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> This was a retrospective comparative study of consecutive NMS patients undergoing PSF pre- and post-implementation of the high-risk pathway in May 2018. Patients with non-neuromuscular scoliosis or procedures other than standard PSF were excluded. The NMS pathway involves preoperative optimization, standardized antibiotics, ICU and inpatient care protocols, standardized perioperative bowel and pain regimen, early transition to oral pain medications, and emphasizes early and frequent mobilization.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> There were 91 patients, including 30 pre- and 61 post-pathway implementation. Baseline patient characteristics were similar pre- versus post-pathway, including age, BMI, weight, gender, major Cobb (75.1 vs 85.5&#xB0;, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.107), T2-T12 kyphosis (70.4 vs 85.6&#xB0;, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.44), ASA classification, use of feeding tube (73% vs 62%), oxygen dependency (40% vs 39%), and wheelchair dependency (93% vs 95%) (all p&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.1). The post-pathway group had significantly greater use of pelvic instrumentation (43% pre vs 74% post, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.005), with greater number of fusion levels (14.4 pre vs 15.3 post, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.015) and longer operative duration (316&#x2009;min pre- vs 357 post-pathway, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.032), though with decreased use of a central line (50% pre vs 28% post, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.039) and similar EBL (893 mL pre vs 775 post, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.327) and intraoperative allogeneic transfusion (38% pre vs 54% post, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.473). The mean ICU length of stay dropped from 3.8 to 2.5 nights post-pathway (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.017), while total hospital length of stay likewise dropped (pre-pathway mean 8.3, median 7, versus post-pathway mean 6.8, median 5, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). There were no differences in incidence of deep surgical site infection (10% vs 13%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.664) or post-operative ED visits, readmissions, or reoperations (all p&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.1).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> A comprehensive multidisciplinary perioperative pathway for high-risk neuromuscular patients results in significantly shorter ICU and total hospital length of stay, despite more complex surgeries with greater use of pelvic instrumentation and longer operative duration, without resultant increase in infection, ED visits, readmissions, or reoperations.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> A standardized perioperative pathway for neuromuscular scoliosis can reduce ICU utilization and decrease total hospitalization length of stay, without an increase in complications or return visits/reoperations. This pathway therefore conserves hospital resources and should substantially decrease cost of hospitalization.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Severe spinal deformity is associated with restrictive pulmonary disease, secondary to chest wall distortion and limitations in lung volume. Traditional pulmonary function tests (PFTs) like spirometry and body plethysmography, although gold standards, have limitations such as patient discomfort and require patient cooperation. This study explores the utility of surface topographic (ST) scanning as an alternative protocol, specifically investigating whether ST measurements of body volume difference (BVD) between maximum inhalation and exhalation correlate with key pulmonary metrics like forced vital capacity (FVC), vital capacity (VC), total lung capacity (TLC), residual volume (RV), and forced expiratory volume (FEV1).</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> This retrospective study analyzed pediatric patients aged 10&#x2013;18&#x2009;years with spinal deformities and thoracic or thoracolumbar curves of &#x2265;40&#xB0;. Patients with prior chest or spine surgery or with Scheuermann&#x2019;s kyphosis were excluded. All patients received ST scans, standard clinical evaluations, and EOS radiographs, along with PFTs within 3&#x2009;months of imaging. The ST scans calculated BVD as the difference in total body volume between maximal inhalation and exhalation. Linear regression was used to evaluate the relationship between BVD, standard PFT values, as well as the magnitude of spinal (thoracic and thoracolumbar) curves.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> The study included 18 patients (average age 14.4&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;2.2&#x2009;years, body mass index (BMI) 21.4&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;4.5&#x2009;kg/m&#xB2;, 72.2% female) with a mean thoracic/thoracolumbar curve of 61.5&#xB0;&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;13.9&#xB0; (45.1&#xB0;&#x2013;92.6&#xB0;). Sixteen patients had idiopathic scoliosis, one had neuromuscular scoliosis, and one had thoracogenic scoliosis. Strong correlations were found between BVD and FVC (R&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.874, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001), VC (R&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.831, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001), and TLC (R&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.768, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001). No significant correlations were identified between the Cobb angle and either ST BVD measurements or PFT values.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> ST scanning offers a novel and less-intrusive approach to evaluating lung volumes, potentially avoiding formal PFTs and/or CT scans and saving time and frustration for both healthcare providers and patients. The strong positive correlations between ST BVD measurements and FVC, VC, and TLC suggest that ST scanning may be a viable method for assessing pulmonary volumes in pediatric patients with significant spinal deformities.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> As a rapid, non-contact and reproducible method, ST scanning may be particularly useful for patients who are unable to undergo traditional PFTs. Future research with a larger and more diverse patient population is in progress to validate these findings.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> In patients with myelomeningocele stable low profile pelvic instrumentation required in spinal deformity surgery may be difficult to obtain due to the variable dysmorphic pelvic anatomy. Several techniques have been proposed but the superiority of one or another in this challenging population has not been established. Our aim is to determine the pelvic morphology in patients with myelomeningocele-associated scoliosis and its relation to pelvic fixation and deformity correction strategies.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> We analyzed the computed tomography (CT) scans performed for preoperative planning of scoliosis corrective surgery in 26 individuals with myelomeningocele and the CT scans obtained for the diagnosis of appendicitis in an otherwise healthy age and gender-matched cohort. The mean age range was 10.4 (range 1.9&#x2013;19.4)&#x2009;years. Three-dimensional reformatting of the CT scans was performed to permit accurate measurements of bone depth and ideal (best available bone stock) screw trajectories for standard pelvic fixation methods. Segmental anatomic parameters and intersegmental anchor relationships were determined: (1) sacral alar iliac (SAI); (2) posterior superior iliac spine (PSIS); (3) anatomic; (4) sacral-alar; (5) width of sacrum at SAI entry; and (6) distance between anchor entry sites.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> The cohort of patients with myelomeningocele had greater variation in the angles of their pelvic screws in both the sagittal and axial plane; at least one screw trajectory was impossible in more than half of the myelomeningocele patients compared to only one control patient with an impossible trajectory. In both groups, the SAI screws (most commonly) had the most harmonious start points compared to L5 screws; however, in both groups, several patients had L5 start points that lined up better with iliac screws in the horizontal plane. We found that in every patient, the sacral ala was at least 1&#x2009;cm thick and that as a portion of the posterior sacral width, the sacral canal was not wider in the patients with myelomeningocele.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In this cohort of patients with scoliosis and myelomeningocele, we found multiplanar pelvic asymmetry that led to wide variation in angles for pelvic fixation and many instances where typical trajectories were not possible due to sacral and pelvic morphology.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Three-dimensional CT scans are an invaluable aid to the planning of ideal personalized pelvic fixation techniques. Creativity may be necessary with nontraditional screw trajectories or Dunn&#x2013;McCarthy (or Galveston) techniques to establish a strong pelvic base for spinal fixation and deformity correction.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Non-fusion procedures are growing in use for the AIS treatment. Two devices received limited HDE approval for clinical use by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) in 2019. Although treatment indications are similar, to our knowledge, there is no multicenter comparative study of the perioperative outcomes for these two devices.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> AIS patients who met FDA HDE criteria for PDDD were prospectively enrolled in this matched multicenter comparative study. Inclusion criteria were the diagnosis of Lenke 1/5 AIS, Cobb angle 35&#xB0;&#x2013;60&#xB0; with correction to less than or equal to 30&#xB0; on lateral bend and minimal thoracic kyphosis. These patients were matched by age, gender, Risser score, curve type, and curve magnitude to a single-center cohort of prospectively enrolled VBT patients, and perioperative results were compared up to 1-year follow-up.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Twenty-three PDDD patients were matched to 23 VBT patients. There was no difference in preoperative major Cobb angle (46 vs 47&#xB0;, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.5), age (13.2 vs 13.0, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.6), curve type (90% thoracic for both groups, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.0), Risser or gender. Mean blood loss was significantly higher in the VBT cohort (90 ml vs 35 ml for PDDD, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0064). Mean operative time was longer in the VBT cohort, 173&#x2009;min versus 113&#x2009;min for PDDD (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001), as was length of stay (3.0&#x2009;days vs 1.2, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001). Initial postoperative major Cobb angle and % correction at 6&#x2009;months was improved in the PDDD cohort (15 vs 24&#xB0;, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0001; 67% vs 48%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0003). One PDDD patient required an ICU stay. At 1-year follow-up, the patients in the PDDD cohort had improved Cobb angles (15 vs 21, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001), but no significant difference was seen in patient kyphosis between PDDD and VBT (34 vs 31, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.22). At latest follow-up, one VBT patient was readmitted with a pleural effusion, one underwent cord release due to overcorrection, and 2 PDDD patients underwent revision surgery with replacement of the device.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Prospective perioperative outcomes demonstrate better index correction and reduced operative time, blood loss, and length of stay in PDDD compared to a matched cohort of VBT patients within 1-year post-operation.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Further data on long-term functional benefits and durability of both procedures are needed to determine the value and role of non-fusion scoliosis procedures.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> This study evaluates the efficacy of plastic multilayered closure (PMC) as an infection and wound healing prophylaxis in spinal fusion surgery for pediatric patients with neuromuscular scoliosis (NMS) undergoing primary pelvic instrumentation. We compare surgical site infection (SSI) and wound complication rates between PMC and orthopedic closure (OC) techniques, along with examining differences in operative findings and post-operative care.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective comparative study included patients with NMS undergoing spinal fusion and instrumentation to the pelvis from 2018 to 2023. Patients were identified at two institutions utilizing different standard closure techniques (PMC and OC). Demographics, primary diagnosis, operative details, return to OR, wound healing complications, and SSI were compared. Diagnosis was determined using the Classification for Early-Onset Scoliosis (C-EOS). SSI was defined as infection &#x2264;90&#x2009;days of surgery. Patients age &#x2264;18 at the time of surgery, revision cases, and growing constructs were excluded.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Of the 150 eligible patients (mean age: 13.1; 59% female), 76 received OC, while 74 underwent PMC. There were no significant differences in age, sex, primary diagnosis, number of levels instrumented, units of blood transfused, and cell saver between the two groups (p&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.05). Importantly, patients undergoing PMC exhibited a higher BMI (19.86 vs 17.95, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.003). The median EBL was greater in the OC cohort (700&#x2009;mL vs 512.5&#x2009;mL, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.039). PMC demonstrated a lower rate of SSI (1.4% vs 9.2%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.063). The overall rate of wound healing complications was comparable (12.2% vs 11.8%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.00), but PMC saw a higher rate of dehiscence (12.2% vs 3.9%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.064). Notably, PMC increased mean procedure time by 1.84 hours (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) and median drain time to 7&#x2009;days, with 25.7% discharged with a drain (vs 0% in OC). PMC reduced the risk of return to the operating room (4.1% vs 13.2%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.048).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Plastics multilayered closure (PMC) emerges as a compelling infection prophylaxis strategy in NMS pediatric spinal instrumentation to the pelvis. Despite longer operative times and drain usage, PMC substantially reduces SSI risk without a significant increase in wound healing complications. Surgeons should consider PMC in this high-risk population.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Children with NMS undergoing instrumentation to the pelvis are more prone to deep infection as well as delayed wound healing. PMC appears to be an effective strategy to decrease the risk of SSI although more evidence is required to optimize its effect on wound healing complications.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Back pain is growing in prevalence in adolescents, and MRIs are increasingly ordered to elucidate an underlying cause which can strain resource utilization. The usefulness of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) to help providers determine whether to order a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is unknown. We hypothesized that the PROMIS and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) tools may help predict abnormal MRIs in adolescents with back pain.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Retrospective review of 300 children (100M, 200&#x2009;F) ages 5&#x2013;18&#x2009;years, presenting with caregiver-reported back pain, who underwent spine MRIs, and who had completed (1) the PROMIS Pediatric Computer-Adapted-Test Pain Interference (PI), Mobility, and Anxiety measures, (2) the nine-item ODI, and (3) back pain intensity on a scale of 0&#x2013;5, from April 2021 to June 2023. Patients were excluded if they had non-idiopathic scoliosis, previous spinal surgeries, or specifically neck pain. PROMs were compared in both normal MRIs and abnormal MRIs (defined by presence of correlative and/or causative findings) with Mann&#x2013;Whitney tests and logistic regression analyses. PROMIS and ODI score thresholds were determined with abnormal MRIs via ROC analyses.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 174 children had normal (59%) and 126 had abnormal MRIs. Average overall scores were PROMIS Mobility mild severity (41.3&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;8.7), pain moderate severity (57.5&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;8.4), anxiety within functional limits (47.1&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;10.9), ODI percentage moderate disability (25.0&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;16.8), and back pain intensity 1.7&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1.1 out of 5. Lower PROMIS mobility scores (odds ratio (OR): 0.951; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.923&#x2013;0.978) and higher ODI percentage (OR: 1.015; 95% CI: 1.001&#x2013;1.029) were associated with abnormal MRI findings. There were no associations between PROMIS anxiety, PROMIS PI, and pain intensity with abnormal MRI findings (Table). A PROMIS mobility threshold of 40.5 (area under the characteristic curve (AUC)&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.64) and ODI percentage of 21.1 (AUC&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.58) were associated with abnormal MRIs.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Many patients received unnecessary diagnostic imaging, since more than 50% of patients with back pain had normal MRIs. Lower PROMIS mobility and higher ODI scores, both indicative of higher functional disability, were associated with abnormal spinal MRIs and may therefore serve as useful clinical predictors. While AUC for PROMIS mobility and ODI scores were not strong, they still reflect positive results. PROMIS PI and pain intensity were not associated with abnormal MRIs.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> &#x201C;What you see is more important than what you hear&#x201D;: Decreased mobility and increased disability are more indicative of abnormal MRI findings than pain interference and intensity. In conjunction with a thorough history and physical exam, PROMIS Mobility and ODI tools may aid clinical decision-making on the utility of MRIs in pediatric back pain.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Growth-friendly surgical technique is a treatment method for progressive early-onset scoliosis (EOS). Traditional growing rods (TGRs) are one type of growth-friendly surgical management that requires repeated surgical lengthening, with risk of implant- and wound-related complications. Two types of connectors that differ in the modulus of elasticity are used for TGR instrumentation: tandem (end-to-end) and wedding band (side-to-side) connectors. Compared to wedding band connectors, tandem connectors provide a decreased working length for the rods, hence a greater biomechanical force. This study evaluated the effects of the difference in connector type on postoperative complications and occurrence of unplanned return to the operating room (UPROR).</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> This retrospective, multicenter cohort included EOS patients with TGR as their initial operative strategy and complete 2-year follow-up data. Demographics, complications, and UPROR are summarized and stratified by connector type (tandem vs wedding band). Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used for continuous variables, and Pearson&#x2019;s chi-square tests for categorical variables.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> There were 645 patients included (mean age 6.9&#x2009;years, 55% F). Demographics were similar between connector types. The percentage of patients with neuromuscular and syndromic etiologies was greater in patients with tandem versus wedding band connectors (35% vs 22% and 34% vs 27%, respectively; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Patients with wedding band connectors had greater major (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.03) and minor (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.01) Cobb angle measurements compared to patients in the tandem group. Patients with tandem connectors had a greater total number of rod fractures (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.03), and a greater proportion of patients with tandem connectors (14%) had UPROR related to rod fractures compared to 7% of the wedding band group (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.003). More patients with tandem connectors experienced UPROR compared to patients with wedding band connectors (26% vs 18%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.02), and more patients with tandem connectors reported complications (51%) compared to patients with wedding band connectors (42%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.04).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This comparative cohort study highlights how the biomechanical differences of tandem and wedding band connectors can impact the rates of complications in growing rod treatment. Patients in the tandem connector group had higher occurrences of rod fractures, UPROR, and complications. The results suggest that the greater biomechanical force exerted by tandem connectors could lead to more severe complications that require unplanned, urgent surgeries.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This is the first study to report the effects of connector type on complications in EOS patients treated with growing rod constructs.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Bracing is the mainstay of conservative management for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). However, there are little data comparing treatment outcomes among brace types. Bracing with Rigo Cheneau-style orthoses (RCSOs) has gained popularity over the past decade due to the perceived advantage of three-dimensional correction with initial studies showing that RCSO treatment is effective at preventing curve progression. The purpose of this study is to compare outcomes for patients treated with RCSO and Boston-style thoracolumbar sacral orthoses (BTLSOs) to further justify the widespread replacement of the BTLSO. It was hypothesized that bracing treatment with RCSO will be more effective at preventing curve progression and need for surgery when compared to BTLSO bracing.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Patients who began treatment between 2009 and 2016 with an initial major coronal curve between 20&#xB0; and 45&#xB0;, and no previous scoliosis treatment were included. Study endpoints were skeletal maturity or definitive fusion surgery. The outcome measures included degrees curve progression, percent curve correction, major coronal curve progression &gt;10&#xB0;, and progression to surgery.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 89 patients (47 RCSO and 42 BTLSO) were included. RCSO patients had a higher mean initial major curve compared to the BTLSO cohort. RCSO patients had greater in-brace curve correction percent (48% vs 22%, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Average curve progression over the follow-up period was 2&#xB0;&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;9&#xB0; (from 33&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;7&#xB0; at brace initiation to 35&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;12&#xB0; at last follow-up) in the RCSO group and 8&#xB0;&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;11&#xB0; (from 30&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;6&#xB0; at brace initiation to 38&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;13&#xB0; at last follow-up) in the BTLSO group (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.004). Forty-three percent of patients treated with BTLSO experienced curve progression of more than 10&#xB0; compared to only 13% of patients treated with RCSO (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.003). There were no differences between RCSO and BTLSO in terms of surgery recommended or performed (30% vs 31%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.905).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Patients treated with RCSO have a higher in-brace curve correction and lower rates of curve progression compared to patients treated with BTLSO. This study supports using RCSO as a first-line brace in AIS patients.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Bracing treatment for the conservative management of AIS is widespread, yet the comparative effectiveness of the various brace types has not been definitely established. This study further adds to the literature illustrating the utility of the RCSO brace in comparison to the BTLSO.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Bracing is utilized in the treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) to obviate the need for surgery. The Boston brace is the most studied orthosis in AIS, with other orthoses displaying treatment equivalency with less evidence. The primary objective of this study was to compare treatment outcomes between Rigo and Boston braces with a secondary objective of evaluating the impact of socioeconomic status on treatment outcome.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> AIS patients treated with a brace at a single institution from 2015 to 2022 were included in the study. Demographic data, Cobb angles, Lenke classification, Risser Stage, daily brace wear, and initial brace cost were recorded. Insurance status and child opportunity index were utilized as markers of socioeconomic status. The outcome variable was conversion to surgery. Bivariate analysis was conducted between the variables with chi-square tests for categorical variables and t-tests for numerical variables. A multivariable regression was conducted to investigate the risk-adjusted effect on risk for conversion to surgery.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 138 patients were included in this study. Higher initial Cobb angle (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001, OR 3.8), decreased daily brace wear (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001, OR 4.9), younger age at presentation (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001, OR 6.2) and Lenke type 2&#x2013;4 curves (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) were associated with a statistically significant increased risk of conversion to surgery. In the multivariable analysis, brace type was not associated with conversion to surgery (odds ratio (OR): 1.26, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.69). Rigo braces were associated with an increased initial cost compared to Boston Braces ($1359 vs $1270, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.089). Patients with Medicaid and those living in a neighborhood with a lower child opportunity index were associated with a statistically significant increased risk of brace failure (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0007 and p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0026, respectively) in bivariate analysis. In the multivariable analysis adjusting for age, Risser stage, Lenke type, BMI, Cobb angle at presentation, and daily brace wear, patients with a lower opportunity index and patients with Medicaid insurance were associated with a higher conversion to surgery (odds ratio (OR): 2.7 and OR 4.10, respectively), but this did not reach statistical significance (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.25 and p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.06, respectively).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Boston and Rigo braces were equally effective in the treatment of AIS without significant difference in initial cost. Previously known risk factors for failed treatment were redemonstrated in this study. Patients with Medicaid and lower child opportunity index were found to be at increased risk of non-operative treatment failure though this did not reach statistical significance in a multivariable analysis.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Level III</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> For early-onset scoliosis (EOS) patients with growth-friendly implants, posterior distraction is a known contributor to proximal junctional kyphosis (PJK). Rib-based proximal fixation is thought to potentially reduce the risk of PJK. The effect of revising proximal rib-based implants to rib versus spine-based implants on PJK has not yet been investigated. (1) Patients converted from rib- to spine-based cranial anchors (RTS) have a higher risk of PJK 2 years post-revision compared to those revised to rib-based anchors (RTR). (2) Revising the upper instrumented vertebra (UIV) to the same level increases the risk of PJK at 2 years post-revision compared to revising to a higher level.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> In this retrospective cohort study of EOS patients with rib-based growing constructs undergoing revision surgery with a minimum 2-year follow-up, we assessed pre-revision, post-revision, and 2-year follow-up radiographs. We excluded patients lacking lateral X-rays and attachment data and conducted descriptive analyses.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 280 subjects were included, average age 7.2&#x2009;years at revision with RTS patients slightly older (8.6&#x2009;years vs 7.2&#x2009;years), and 51% female. At 2&#x2009;years, 32% of all patients developed PJK. This risk was higher in RTS patients compared to RTR patients (42.8% vs 30.2%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.09). RTS patients had a greater pre-revision total spine height (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02), greater post-revision sagittal kyphosis (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.04), a more negative 2-year sagittal balance (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01) and trended to have more males (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.08) compared to RTR; all these factors were associated with a greater risk of PJK. There was no difference in risk at 2&#x2009;years of developing PJK among patients revised to a higher level compared to those revised to same level (33.3% vs 30.9%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.74).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> About 32% of all subjects developed PJK at 2-year follow-up. The risk of PJK in RTS patients was 40% higher than in RTR patients. While this did not reach statistical significance to the 0.05 level due to the associations of risk established by literature and replicated in this study, we believe these results to be clinically significant. We intend to re-evaluate this population in the future as more data become available. With no demonstrated risk in revision levels, it is worth considering revising fewer levels to maintain flexibility in these growing rods.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This is the first study to evaluate the risk of PJK after growth-friendly revision surgery. Converting growth-friendly rib-based proximal anchors to spine-based proximal anchors is associated with a clinically significant increased risk of developing PJK when compared to those revised to rib-based proximal anchors.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> While the stated goal of the surgical management of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) remains stable fusion to prevent progression, deformity correction remains a primary goal for many surgeons and patients. Various techniques for deformity correction have been proposed including posterior column osteotomies (PCOs). We developed a technique for PCO (NPCO) whereby the lamina is transected (not resected) cranial to the ligamentum flavum, thereby detethering the posterior column and allowing it to effectively lengthen while minimizing bone loss. Here, report on the safety and efficacy of this technique.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Through retrospective chart review, we collected data on 151 consecutive pediatric patients with AIS undergoing PSF at one institution. Patients were stratified into three groups: no osteotomies (NO), traditional PO, and novel PCO. Outcomes were compared regarding patient demographics, safety outcome measures, and clinical efficacy of deformity correction. Radiographic measurements were performed by a single fellowship-trained spine deformity surgeon who was not involved in the direct care of the patient cohort and who was blind to the details of the patients&#x2019; surgical treatment.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Demographic data between the three cohorts was similar. The median age ranged between 14 and 15&#x2009;years. The median Cobb angle measured between 51&#xB0; and 53&#xB0; in each cohort. No difference was observed regarding neuromonitoring changes between the NO (0/35) and NPCO (1/67) cohorts (p value&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.00). The NPCO group had longer OR time per level as compared to the NO group (17.8&#x2009;minutes vs 14.4, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), but was similar to the PO group (17.8 vs 16.3, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.55). Operative blood loss per fusion level was slightly higher between the NPCO and NO cohorts (15.4&#x2009;mL vs 13.8&#x2009;mL, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.076). Mean coronal plane Cobb angle correction was improved in the NPCO (46.8&#xB0;) cohort compared to both the NO (39.3&#xB0;) and PO (41.5&#xB0;) cohorts. The coronal correction differences between both the NPCO group versus the NO group and between the NPCO group and the PO were significant (p value&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.022 and p value&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001, respectively).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our posterior column osteotomy is a safe alternative to traditional PO and allows for improved deformity correction in the coronal plane compared to both NO and PO.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> The most commonly described PCO for deformity correction was initially described to shorten the posterior column for correction of kyphosis but has subsequently been utilized for scoliosis surgery. Our technique is designed to effectively lengthen the posterior column which allows improved deformity correction while minimizing bone loss that may put the spinal cord at risk.</p>

        <title>Screening magnetic resonance imaging in congenital early-onset scoliosis: is it safe to delay advanced imaging to decrease early anesthesia?</title>
        <p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Patients with congenital early-onset scoliosis (EOS) undergo spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to rule out neural abnormalities. MRIs often require anesthesia in younger patients. Due to the uncertainty of the effects of childhood anesthesia exposure, the FDA advises elective anesthesia be delayed until after age 3. The age at which MRIs are currently obtained in congenital EOS is not well known. We set out to quantify the prevalence of neural axis abnormalities in these patients and determine if a delay in MRIs affects outcomes.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A multicenter registry with information on 751 congenital EOS patients was reviewed. Almost 659 patients were identified after excluding patients without information on MRIs, 2-year follow-up, and other syndromic diagnoses. Data included age and findings of first MRI, neurosurgical interventions, neurologic complications, baseline Cobb angles, and unplanned return to operating room for orthopedic complications (UPROR). We used Pearson bivariate correlations and unpaired Mann&#x2013;Whitney test for statistical analysis.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Data were divided into two groups: patients with an MRI age&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;3 (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;277) and &gt;age 3 (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;382). Around 133 abnormal MRIs were identified (20.2%). A weak negative correlation existed between abnormal MRI and age at time of MRI; however, this was not statistically significant (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;&#x2013;0.038, p&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;.05). In patients with abnormal MRIs, no correlation existed between the age during MRI and UPROR. There were three neurologic complications in the &#x2264;3 group, and no neurologic complications were found in the &gt;3 group, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.04. Neurologic complications included two intra-op dural tears, and one intra-op loss of neuromonitoring signal. A total of 23 neurosurgical procedures were performed among patients with abnormal MRIs (17.3%). No significant difference was found between UPROR in patients with abnormal MRIs&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;3 (14/58) and &gt;3 (21/75), p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.54. There was no significant difference between mean baseline Cobb angles of the two groups (&#x2264;3&#x2009;=&#x2009;66.8&#xB0;, &gt;3&#x2009;=&#x2009;69.4&#xB0;), p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.34 (Table 1).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The prevalence of neural axis abnormalities in congenital EOS was 20.2%. There was no significant correlation between age of first MRI and chance of abnormal MRI. Neurological complications were not significantly different between patients receiving MRIs before or after age 3. UPROR is also not significantly different between the two groups. In congenital EOS, postponing MRI over age 3 can be cautiously done.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> In patients with congenital EOS, there are no significant complications from delaying MRI.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Posterior column osteotomies are frequently used to facilitate multiplanar correction in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). The indications for their use remain controversial, and some evidence suggests an increase in blood loss and potential risk for neurologic injury. We have previously described a novel, stepwise approach to posterior column osteotomy using the ultrasonic bone scalpel. This method involves in situ osteotomies (ISO) of the superior articular process (SAP) and spinous process (SPO), where the osteotomized bone fragments are left in place, minimizing spinal canal exposure (Figure 1). We hypothesized that this approach would lead to reduced operating time and blood loss, achieving non-inferior results in coronal and sagittal plane correction to traditional Ponte osteotomies, with no difference in the rate of neurologic injury.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> We retrospectively identified patients with AIS who underwent posterior spinal fusion with posterior column osteotomies between 2019 and 2023. We compared intraoperative and early postoperative outcomes between patients who underwent traditional Ponte osteotomies (PO) versus in-situ osteotomies (ISO).</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> During this period, we identified 73 patients with an average age of 15 who underwent posterior column osteotomies for AIS. Around 60% had PO (average 5.0 per case), and 40% had ISO. Average preoperative major Cobb angle was 60&#xB0;, and average preoperative kyphosis was 31&#xB0; for the entire cohort. Kyphosis did not vary between the two groups. The PO group had a greater average preoperative major Cobb (mean 62&#xB0; versus 56&#xB0;, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02) and postoperative Cobb (mean 26&#xB0; versus 19&#xB0;, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01) (Figure 2). The groups did not differ in kyphosis, Lenke classifications, or demographics. No significant differences were observed for total intraoperative blood loss, blood loss per instrumented level, operative time, operative time per instrumented level, coronal curve correction (34.5&#xB0; and 36.8&#xB0;, respectively), postoperative kyphosis, or length of stay between the PO and ISO groups. No patient from either group experienced a neurologic injury.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> ISO offers comparable results to PO with less spinal canal exposure. Within our cohort, ISO were performed on marginally smaller curves with no significant difference in correction. We observed no significant differences in blood loss, hospital stay duration, or curve correction. Additional research is needed to evaluate the long-term outcomes of this procedure and its potential impact on the minimal risk of neurologic injury.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> In situ osteotomies utilizing an ultrasonic bone scalpel might offer a safer alternative to traditional Ponte osteotomies while delivering clinically comparable results.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Vertebral body tethering (VBT) is a promising alternative to fusion for scoliosis treatment. However, tether breakage is common with rates up to 50% reported. In these cases, it remains unknown whether the curve will progress or remain stable.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Adolescent and juvenile idiopathic scoliosis patients in a multicenter registry s/p VBT treatment were identified with either 2-year follow-up or breakage prior to that. Broken tethers were identified by increase in screw divergence of &gt;5&#xB0; on serial radiographs. Revision procedures and curve magnitude at subsequent visits were recorded.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> About 88 patients with tether breakage were identified with mean age at time of index VBT of 12.4&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1.4&#x2009;years and mean curve magnitude of 51.8&#xB0;&#xB1;&#x2009;8.1&#xB0;. Tether breakage occurred at a mean of 29.5&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;12.0&#x2009;months and mean curve of 33.9&#xB0;&#xB1;&#x2009;13.2&#xB0;. 6.8% (6/88) had tether revision and 2/88 (2.3%) had fusion within the first year after breakage. At 1-year post breakage, remaining patients had a mean curve of 36.2&#xB0;&#xB1;&#x2009;15.5&#xB0;. 22/51 (43%) had progression &gt;5&#xB0;. Three additional patients had a fusion between the first and second year post breakage. At 2&#x2009;years post breakage, the remaining patients had a mean curve of 40.5&#xB0;&#xB1;&#x2009;8.2&#xB0;. Fifteen out of 30 (50%) had progression &gt;5&#xB0;. Two patients had a fusion &gt;2&#x2009;years post breakage. The remaining patients with follow-up &gt;2&#x2009;years post breakage had a mean curve of 38.5&#xB0;&#xB1;&#x2009;9.2&#xB0; and 11/21 (52%) had progression &gt;5&#xB0;. In total, 45% (27/60) of patients had progression &gt;5&#xB0; and 20% (12/60) had progression &gt;10&#xB0; post tether breakage. About 29% (11/38) of patients with a curve &gt;35&#xB0; at time of breakage had additional surgery versus 2% (1/50) of patients that had &#x2264;35&#xB0; (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01). Skeletally immature patients (Risser&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;3) had a higher rate of revision surgery compared to skeletally mature (Risser&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;4) patients (9/30, 30% vs 3/58, 5%; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002). Rates of curve progression&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;5&#xB0; were similar between skeletally immature and mature patients (7/19, 37% vs 20/41, 49%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.42).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Nearly half of patients had curve progression following tether breakage, including some that were skeletally mature. Approximately a third of skeletally immature patients or those with curves&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;35&#xB0; at time of breakage had additional surgery. Additional surgery was rare (1/50) in patients with curves &lt;35&#xB0; at time of breakage.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Mild curve progression is common after tether breakage following VBT, but infrequently requires revision surgery.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Operating room (OR) standardization positively impacts outcomes in many surgical fields. (In a previous study, our group demonstrated that standardization in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) surgery improves patient outcomes such as operative time, blood loss (EBL), superficial infection rate and length of stay (LOS). Standardization in our previous study was accomplished by both systemizing procedural steps and by assembling a consistent team. This study seeks to investigate the impact that process standardization has independently from a standard team.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> In 2020, a standardized team was established by five anesthesiologists, three OR technicians, three nurses, and three neurophysiologists. Our standardized process was also established in 2020 by consolidating various procedural steps. Our data for the standardized team group was therefore collected from 2020 to 2022 AIS cases who underwent a posterior spinal fusion (PSF). In 2023, new ORs opened, while the standardized process remained, a dedicated team did not. This created our standardized process group, AIS cases who underwent a PSF in 2023. Continuous variables were expressed as medians with interquartile range (IQR) values. Kruskal&#x2013;Wallis test was used. Categorical variables were expressed as percentages and p values were obtained from chi-square test.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 267 pediatric spinal deformity cases were included. A total of 185 patients underwent surgery with the standard team whereas 82 patients with the standard process utilized. There was no difference between groups in demographic variables or preoperative Cobb angle, levels fused and number of fixation points. Postop Cobb angle (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), anesthesia time (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), and surgery time (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002) demonstrated significant differences favoring the standard process. There was no significant relationship between standardization method and EBL, LOS, 30-day, or 90-day complications.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This study examines efficiency of a standardized process versus a standardized process and team. Implementation of a regularized OR process and protocol correlates to increased operative efficiency, decreased anesthesia time, and improved postoperative radiographic measures used to quantify the magnitude of residual deformity.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Most institutions may not be able to standardize a team, but a standardized process can be easily implemented. Our findings suggest that a standardized process alone can have beneficial outcomes.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> There is a known demonstrated decrease in pulmonary function in individuals with scoliotic spine deformities. This can be attributed to thoracic cage and chest wall stiffness, uneven distribution of air to bilateral lung fields from scoliotic deformity and reduced diaphragmatic movement. We sought to identify radiographic parameters that correlated with poorer pulmonary function tests in patients with Lenke Type 1 and 2 thoracic adolescent idiopathic scoliosis to create a novel radiographic measure of thoracic deformity.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> We retrospectively reviewed all patients at our institution who underwent posterior spinal fusion for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis and identified 153 patients with Lenke type 1 or 2 curves. Patient demographics, surgical data, preoperative radiographs, and preoperative pulmonary function tests (PFTs) were recorded. We measured thoracic Cobb angles for all patients as well as coronal and sagittal ratios. The coronal ratio (CR) is defined as a measurement of the horizontal distance from the center of the apical vertebra to each side of the rib cage. The convex distance is divided by the concave distance with values approaching one indicating chest symmetry. The sagittal ratio (SR) was defined on a lateral radiograph as the distance from the center of the apical vertebra in a line parallel to the endplate to the sternum and divided by the distance from the center of the apical vertebra to the posterior rib hump. For both ratios, a lower value indicates greater levels of deformity. A thoracic deformity index (TDI) was created to represent the total thoracic deformity as calculated by multiplying the coronal and sagittal ratios. TDI&#x2009;=&#x2009;CR * SR Lower values of TDI corresponds with greater total thoracic deformity present by accounting for the sagittal and coronal deformities. Regression analysis was performed to determine correlation between TDI and PFTs.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 153 patients were analyzed with an average Cobb angle of 67.0 (range: 45.9&#x2013;110) and an average TDI was 0.70 (range: 0.08&#x2013;1.28). All the identified radiographic parameters were correlated with poorer preoperative pulmonary function. TDI was most strongly correlated with poorer preoperative pulmonary function (R&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.36, p&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;0.0001) when compared to Cobb angle (R&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.28, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0004), sagittal index (R&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.21, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01), and coronal index (R&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.31, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001). Furthermore, this correlation remained statistically significant when analyzing FVC and TDI with regard to a subset of patients with Cobb angles 50&#xB0;&#x2013;59&#xB0; (R&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.37, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> TDI was correlated with worse PFTs in patients undergoing posterior spinal fusion for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Novel radiographic measure which correlates with PFTs.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Vertebral body tethering (VBT) for AIS offers a non-fusion alternative treatment to the gold standard posterior spinal fusion (PSF). Outcomes of VBT in comparison to PSF are not fully known and may vary by surgeon and operative indications. We sought to compare outcomes of patients who underwent VBT versus those who underwent PSF for Lenke 1 AIS in the first single-surgeon comparison with up to 6-year follow-up (FU) of this most common curve type.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Single-surgeon retrospective review comparing VBT and PSF. Inclusion criteria were AIS diagnosis, Lenke 1 curve, major curve&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;70, PHOS maturity&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;3 and minimum 2-year follow-up (FU). Clinical success was defined as both thoracic major curve and thoracolumbar/lumbar minor curve &#x2264;30&#xB0;. Pre-operative kyphosis on standard radiographs was converted to a 3D value based on a validated formula. Continuous variables were compared using Welch&#x2019;s t-test and categorical variables were compared using chi-square.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> About 27 VBT and 22 PSF consecutive patients met the criteria (Table). Mean FU for VBT and PSF was 3.4&#x2009;years and 3.6&#x2009;years, respectively. Pre-operative parameters were similar between groups. Similar correction of the major thoracic curve was achieved between VBT and PSF (FU curve 22.7 vs 22.4 (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.88), % correction 53.3 versus 54.5 (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.79), respectively) (Table). There was a similar increase in 3-D kyphosis (T5-T12) for both groups (16.1 vs 17.4 (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.76), respectively). Clinical success in the VBT group was 77.8% and in the PSF group 81.8% (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.82). Both operative time and EBL were greater in PSF. About 33% of VBT patients experienced tether breakage at latest FU, and 5/9 (55.6%) of these patients were clinically successful. Inclinometer improvements were similar for both. No VBT patients required reoperation, but one had a plowed proximal screw not requiring revision. One PSF patient underwent irrigation, debridement, and implant exchange for deep surgical site infection.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> AIS patients who had VBT for Lenke 1 AIS had comparable radiographic and inclinometer outcomes to those that underwent PSF. Kyphosis was similarly improved in both groups. Long-term assessment will be determinative of the benefits and durability of outcomes of VBT versus PSF.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Similar coronal and sagittal plane correction can be achieved with VBT using refined indications and posterior spinal fusion.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> The literature on AIS lacks sufficient information about flexibility, as only a few studies incorporate patients&#x2019; self-perception of flexibility despite it being a frequent concern of patients. The aim of this study is to assess how PSF affects the perceived flexibility in AIS patients.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> This study included 103 participants, consisting of 79 AIS patients who underwent PSF between 2016 and 2022, and 24 non-operative control patients. Data were collected retrospectively through radiographic and chart review, as well as via phone/email. Around 180 patients were contacted, 129 had a working phone/email listed in the electronic health record (her). Among those, 79 patients responded to the survey (response rate of 61.2%). The survey asked about toe-touch, lateral bending, and trunk rotation, as well as patients&#x2019; perceived flexibility and activity levels on a revised Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (indicating severely limited flexibility and sedentary lifestyles) to 10 (representing high flexibility and activity levels). Patients were also asked about the time it took them to return to various competitive and recreational activities.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Seventy-nine patients underwent PSF, with lowest instrumented vertebra of T9 to L4. Sixty-two patients were fused to L3/L4, and 17 patients were fused to T12/L1. Demographic and radiographic information was the same (p&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.05). No difference in length of stay (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.90). Preoperatively, self-assessed flexibility (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.76) and activity levels Likert-type scale results (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.80) were similar. Postoperatively, both groups had similar flexibility (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.12) and activity levels (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.09). Flexibility levels did not change between pre- and postoperative visit for L3/L4 (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.32) or T12/L1 (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.87) patients. L1+ patients were significantly less likely to be able to touch their toes pre (85.5% vs 58.8%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02) and post-surgery (75.8% vs 58.8%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.17) and neither significantly changed after surgery (85.5% vs 75.8%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.20; 58.8% vs 58.8%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;1). These groups were similar to the control group before (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.21) and after (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.43) surgery. L3/L4 patients returned to unrestricted gym and competitive sport at an average of 5.8&#x2009;months and 6.9&#x2009;months versus 6.3&#x2009;months and 7.1&#x2009;months for T12/L1 (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.48, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.35).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The general belief is that fusion to L3/L4 restricts patients&#x2019; flexibility, sports activities, and ability to touch toes. However, our study suggests that adolescents have consistent flexibility levels both pre- and post-operative.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> A concern of patients is that fusion may limit their flexibility post-operative; however, few studies have investigated patient-reported flexibility levels pre- and post-operative.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Patellofemoral instability is a common problem and medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) reconstruction is a standard treatment for recurrent instability. The anatomic footprint of the MPFL insertion on the patella in the coronal plane is well defined in the literature, but sagittal MPFL patellar insertion anatomy is not. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the sagittal MPFL insertion on the patella in pediatric specimens to guide anatomic reconstruction.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Nine pediatric cadaveric knee specimens were dissected. The patella and sagittal MPFL insertion were evaluated. The maximal anterior/posterior patellar width, posterior patella to posterior MPFL insertion, patellar articular cartilage edge to MPFL insertion, maximal MPFL thickness, and MPFL insertion to anterior patella was measured. The proportion of the patella that the sagittal MPFL footprint inserted upon was calculated.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> The pediatric knee specimens had an average age of 9.8&#x2009;years (range: 9&#x2013;11). The mean maximal transverse patellar width was 19.9 (range: 16.8&#x2013;22.7)&#x2009;mm. The mean posterior patella to posterior MPFL distance was 11.1 (range: 9.4&#x2013;12.6)&#x2009;mm. The mean medial patellar articular cartilage edge to MPFL distance was 2.4 (range: 1.8&#x2013;3.5)&#x2009;mm. The mean maximal MPFL thickness was 4.3 (range: 3.2&#x2013;5.5)&#x2009;mm. The mean anterior MPFL to anterior patella distance was 4.5 (range: 2.6&#x2013;5.8)&#x2009;mm. The sagittal MPFL insertion footprint spanned a mean 22% (range: 16.1%&#x2013;29.2%) of the medial patella.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Understanding the MPFL origin and insertion points is fundamental for anatomic and functional reconstruction of the ligament. Most cadaveric studies report the MPFL insertion in the coronal plane, with a focus on insertion footprint relative to the midline of the patella. This series of anatomic dissections in skeletally immature subjects demonstrated that the sagittal insertion of the MPFL was consistently seen in the anterior &#x2153; of the maximal thickness of the patella. The distance of the MPFL insertion to the medial articular cartilage edge was also minimally variable, which is a significant consideration in surgical planning for MPFL graft placement.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This research further characterizes the anatomy of the insertion of the MPFL onto the medial aspect of the patella, with a unique focus upon the sagittal plane location. The MPFL attachment on the patella is much closer to the anterior region of the patella compared to the posterior region, spans about 22% of the sagittal width of the patella and originates just a few millimeters anterior to the articular cartilage. This provides a clear location for anatomic graft placement on the patella for MPFL reconstruction.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Radial meniscus tears have relatively high failure rates and are associated with progression to osteoarthritis. Previous studies have shown benefits of the addition of &#x201C;rebar&#x201D; sutures parallel to the radial tear, forming &#x201C;hashtag constructs&#x201D; to strengthen the repair. Recent repair techniques allow for meniscus-based suturing and for capsule based suturing for radial tear repairs. The study purpose was to evaluate the biomechanics of four different suture repair patterns utilizing &#x201C;hashtag&#x201D; constructs, including meniscus-based, capsule-based, and combined repair patterns.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> About 24 fresh-frozen lateral human menisci were randomized into four groups. A complete radial tear was created at the midbody of each meniscus. Suture repairs were performed using 2.0 braided suture. All four techniques included a box-type &#x201C;hashtag&#x201D; suture repair with two reinforcing rebar-type sutures parallel to the tear and two sutures crossing the tear. The four techniques used included one (1) all-inside rebar construct, one (1) all-capsule rebar construct, and two (2) combined inside and capsule-based rebar constructs (Figure 1). The repaired meniscus underwent cyclic loading and load-to-failure testing, replicating the biomechanical testing protocol of Baird et al. Statistical analysis includes mean load-to-failure, standard deviation, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) testing.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Mean ultimate failure load for each repair pattern are seen in Table 1. Through observation, it was noted that in almost all cases, the rebar sutures helped prevent suture cutout at lower loads, acting as a restraint to the horizontal sutures &#x201C;cheese-wiring&#x201D; through the meniscus. There was no significance difference in mean ultimate failure load among the four rebar constructs using ANOVA testing (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.266). In comparison to three non-rebar suture repair constructs for radial meniscus tears from Baird et al tested with the same protocol, all four rebar suture repair constructs failed at a significantly higher ultimate failure load.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In a cadaveric lateral meniscus model, utilizing rebar sutures parallel to the tear provided reinforcement for the sutures spanning the tear and resulted in a higher load-to-failure. All four of the rebar constructs in our study had a mean ultimate failure load significantly greater than the non-rebar suture repair constructs tested previously (Baird et al). There was no significant difference between the four &#x201C;hashtag&#x201D; constructs tested, indicating that the inclusion of the rebar suture is beneficial in a variety of different suture patterns, including all-inside meniscus-based sutures, capsule-based sutures, and combination suture patterns.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Surgeons should consider adding parallel rebar sutures to their suture constructs when repairing radial tears arthroscopically.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Inequities in the timing of pediatric anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) are well established, but it is unclear exactly where in the preoperative timeline these disparate delays originate. This study aims to identify differences in the course and timing of preoperative care for pediatric anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries with respect to insurance and race/ethnicity. Such data can guide intervention design.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Patients aged&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;18&#x2009;years that underwent primary ACLR at a single tertiary children&#x2019;s hospital were included in this retrospective cohort study. Exclusion criteria included multiligament reconstructions, previous knee surgery, or intentionally delayed ACLR. We calculated the time elapsed between various timepoints, including injury, first evaluation, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), evaluation by the treating surgeon, and ACLR. Also noted were the number and types of clinicians seen before surgery. Multivariate regressions were used to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) while controlling for confounders.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 534 patients were included (mean age 15.8&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1.8&#x2009;years, 51% male). Children with public insurance and Latinx/Hispanic and Black patients had increased odds of surgery&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;90&#x2009;days after injury (Table 1). Seeking opinions from multiple surgeons (more common for privately insured and White patients) was not associated with this delay but seeing &#x2265;3 total clinicians (more common for publicly insured patients) was. Publicly insured (OR: 1.7, 95% CI: 1.1&#x2013;2.7; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.03) and Latinx/Hispanic patients (OR: 1.7, 95% CI: 1.1&#x2013;3.0; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.04) were more likely to be misdiagnosed prior to MRI than privately insured and White patients, respectively. Children with public insurance had 1.7 times higher odds of initial evaluation in an emergency department (ED) or urgent care (UC) than those with private insurance (95% CI: 1.1&#x2013;2.5, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.009). Latinx/Hispanic (OR: 2.1, 95% CI: 1.3&#x2013;3.3; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.002) and Black patients (OR: 2.1, 95% CI: 1.2&#x2013;3.7; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.009) were also more likely to visit an ED/UC initially. Finally, insurance or race/ethnicity were associated with delays at every point in the preoperative timeline, even when controlling for confounders (Table 1).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> When considering insurance and race/ethnicity, inequities in timing of ACLR result from disparate delays in each step of the preoperative timeline. In addition, publicly insured or minoritized patients are more likely to be misdiagnosed initially, first seek care at an ED/UC (rather than with a pediatrician or surgeon) and see &#x2265;3 clinicians before surgery.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This study highlights, for the first time, differences in the course and timeline of care prior to pediatric ACLR based on insurance and race/ethnicity, providing data upon which future interventions may be designed.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Discoid meniscus (DM) is often associated with peripheral rim instability. While posterior instability (PI) has garnered significant attention in the medical literature, there is a relative lack of awareness regarding anterior instability (AI) in DM cases. This study aims to shed light on the occurrence, presentation, diagnostic approach, treatment strategies, and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) related to AI treatment in DM patients.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective review was conducted at a single institution to analyze patients who underwent arthroscopic treatment for symptomatic DM from 2014 to 2020, with a minimum follow-up of 1 year. The cohort was categorized based on the presence of AI, and all patients with AI underwent repair using the outside-in technique. Data collection included patient demographics, clinical presentation, meniscus pathology, surgical technique, reoperation occurrences, and complication rates. PROs were collected, including Tegner-Lysholm, IKDC, and KOOS for symptoms, pain, ADL, sports, and QOL. Standard statistical analyses were applied, with a significance threshold set at p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 59 patients were included. About 50.84% of the cohort exhibited AI, with 20% having isolated AI and 30% having it in combination with PI. Notably, patients with AI tended to be female, younger, and skeletally immature compared to other presentation types. A majority (83.33%) of patients with anterior or anterior/posterior combined instability had vertical tears. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) correlated with arthroscopic findings in 73% of cases with AI, compared to 88.4% in other presentation types (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.08). PROs demonstrated significant improvement from preoperative to postoperative, including Tegner&#x2013;Lysholm scores (61.5 vs 93.5, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.04), IKDC scores (54.4 vs 90.3, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01), KOOS symptom scores (64.4 vs 89.2, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.005), KOOS pain scores (63.6 vs 93, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.005), KOOS ADL scores (80 vs 97.7, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.03), KOOS sports scores (50 vs 92.8, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01), and KOOS QOL scores (60.2 vs 79.1, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02). Compared to other types of presentation, patients with AI reported similarly favorable PROs, low reoperation rate, and low rate of complications.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> DM with AI occurrence was 50%. Patients with AI tended to be female, younger, and skeletally immature. MRI presents lower sensitivity to detect AI. Surgical repair leads to improved PROs, low complications, and reoperations rate, similar to other presentation types.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Our findings underscore the importance of further research focusing on AI in DM cases. In addition, they emphasize the necessity for surgeons to be aware of the potentially high incidence of AI in patients with DM. Increased awareness and understanding of this condition can lead to improved patient care and outcomes.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Despite established effects of return-to-sports (RTS) timing on ACL reconstruction (ACLR), little is known regarding factors influencing RTS timing, among younger patients. The purpose of this study was to examine the relation between patient-related, injury-related, and surgery-related factors and timing of RTS post-operatively at a single tertiary care pediatric center over a 20-year period.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A natural language processing (NLP) pipeline was developed to identify ACLR cases from the electronic health records from a single center between 2000 and 2020 (Figure 1). Linear regression was used to investigate how patient-related (age, sex, BMI, sports played, and insurance), injury-related (mechanism of injury, primary vs reinjury, concomitant injuries to the PCL, PLC, MCL, and menisci), and surgery-related (year of surgery, days from injury to surgery, surgery duration in minutes, graft type, and meniscus surgery) factors may correlate to time of RTS (days from ACLR to unrestricted RTS).</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 5648 ACL surgeries from 4992 unique patients of any age (age: 17.0&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;4.0; 53% females; 84% &lt;20&#x2009;years old) were identified. Mean RTS was 213&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;106&#x2009;days after surgery. In a bivariate setting, year (b&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.8; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), age (b&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.85; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.05), female sex (b&#x2009;=&#x2009;13.4; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), higher body mass index (BMI; b&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.76; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.013), public insurance (b&#x2009;=&#x2009;14.6; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.004), longer surgery duration (b&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.5; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft (BTB) (b&#x2009;=&#x2009;26.8; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), quadriceps tendon autograft (b&#x2009;=&#x2009;58.5; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), and medial meniscus repair (b&#x2009;=&#x2009;11.9;=&#x2009;0.01) were associated with later RTS. Level I sports (b&#x2009;=&#x2009;&#x2013;22.6, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), level II sports (b&#x2009;=&#x2009;&#x2013;9.2, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.009), hamstring autografts (b&#x2009;=&#x2009;&#x2013;15.7, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), and medial meniscectomy (b&#x2009;=&#x2009;&#x2013;14.1, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.042) were associated with earlier RTS. Multivariable analysis of significant predictors showed that later year (b&#x2009;=&#x2009;5.5, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), female sex (b&#x2009;=&#x2009;21.5; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), public insurance (b&#x2009;=&#x2009;12.4; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.018), longer surgery duration (b&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.4, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), and BTB autograft (b&#x2009;=&#x2009;15.9, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.004) were associated with later RTS, while level 1 sports (b&#x2009;=&#x2009;13.5, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.003) was associated with an earlier RTS after ACLR.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Older patients, females, those with higher BMI and public insurance received later RTS clearance, which could be due to patient preference or later follow-ups in those with public insurance, along with different rehabilitation approaches. Interestingly, athletes who played higher risk sports underwent earlier RTS, which may have been influenced by the athletes&#x2019; desire for a faster RTS. Expectedly, meniscus repair was associated with slower RTS compared to meniscectomy. Finally, BTB or quadriceps autografts were associated with later RTS, compared to hamstring autograft.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This study suggests that several patient-, injury-, and surgical-related factors may influence RTS timing, which could be used to improve outcomes and minimize risk of re-injury.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> There is limited evidence related to the effects of autograft type on functional performance after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction (ACLR). This study compared biomechanical outcomes during the drop vertical jump test (DVJ) between patients with a hamstring autograft (HS), quadriceps autograft with bone block (QB), quadriceps autograft without bone block (Q), and bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft (BTB) 6&#x2009;months postoperatively in an adolescent population. The authors hypothesized that there would be differences in biomechanical profiles between athletes depending on autograft type used.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Patients aged 8&#x2013;18&#x2009;years who underwent primary ACLR were included for analysis. Kinematic and kinetic data collected during a DVJ using a 3D computerized marker system (Motion Analysis Corp. CORTEX software) was assessed 6&#x2009;months after ACLR and compared to the uninjured contralateral limb.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> One hundred fifty-five subjects were included for review. There were no significant differences in terms of age, sex, or affected leg (p&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.1973) between groups. The HS group was significantly associated with larger knee valgus moments at initial contact as compared to the Q group (28&#x2009;&#xD7;&#x2009;10<sup>&#x2013;2</sup>&#x2009;N*m/kg vs &#x2212;35 &#xD7; 10<sup>&#x2013;2</sup>&#x2009;N*m/kg, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0254) and significantly larger hip adduction moments compared to the QB group (30 &#xD7; 10<sup>&#x2013;2</sup>&#x2009;N*m/kg vs &#x2212;4.0 &#xD7; 10<sup>&#x2013;2</sup>&#x2009;N*m/kg, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0426). Both the QB (&#x2212;12 &#xD7; 10<sup>&#x2013;2</sup>&#x2009;N*m/kg vs &#x2013;3.0 &#xD7; 10<sup>&#x2013;2</sup>&#x2009;N*m/kg, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0265) and Q group (&#x2013;13 &#xD7; 10<sup>&#x2013;2</sup>&#x2009;N*m/kg vs &#x2013;3.0 &#xD7; 10<sup>&#x2013;2</sup>&#x2009;N*m/kg, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.459) demonstrated significantly decreased knee extension moment averages as compared to a hamstring autograft.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The findings of this study suggest that utilizing a hamstring autograft results in a significantly increased knee valgus moment at initial contact as compared to quadriceps autograft without bone block at 6&#x2009;months after ACLR in adolescent patients performing a drop vertical jump. Quadriceps autograft was found to have significantly decreased extensor mechanism function when compared to a hamstring autograft.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This study adds unique kinematic and kinetic information regarding various ACLR autograft options and highlights the biomechanical deficits that should be taken into consideration in rehabilitation.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) ruptures are a common injury treated by orthopedic surgeons and are typically managed operatively in the adolescent population. Meniscal injuries were previously reported to occur infrequently in adults; however, it is imperative that meniscal injuries receive proper treatment to optimize outcomes. Adolescent patients are a common age group in which ACL injuries occur and are at particular risk of the long-term implications of meniscal and chondral injuries. We hypothesized a high incidence of concomitant meniscal injury in adolescents undergoing ACL reconstruction surgery and sought to characterize the distribution of meniscal injuries within this population.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A total of 1022 adolescent patients aged 10&#x2013;19 with a history of surgically treated ACL ruptures were identified at our institution between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2021. Patients with surgically treated multiligamentous knee injuries, revision ACL reconstruction, or incomplete imaging studies were excluded. We then retrospectively reviewed the clinic notes, operative reports, and preoperative knee MRI to collect demographic and operative data and determine the presence or absence of surgically managed medial and lateral meniscal pathology.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 873 adolescent patients met the inclusion criteria with surgical history of ACL reconstruction. We identified a total rate of 83.7% (731/873) with concomitant surgically treated meniscus injury. Meniscal tears were further classified as medial, lateral, or both. From this group, there were 241 (26.6%) patients with isolated medial meniscal pathology, 101 (11.6%) patients with isolated lateral meniscal pathology, and 389 (44.6%) patients with both lateral and medial meniscal pathology.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The results of this retrospective review support our hypothesis that there is a high rate of concomitant meniscal injury in adolescent athletes undergoing ACL reconstruction. The rates of meniscal pathology we identified were higher than the rates typically reported in the adult patient population.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Our results shed new light on the prevalence of concomitant meniscal injury with adolescent ACL tears. Based on these findings, surgeons treating ACL injuries in adolescent patients should have a higher index of suspicion for additional intraarticular pathology and be prepared to treat these injuries at the time of ACL surgery.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> The purpose of this study was to evaluate patient-reported outcomes (PROs), return to activity, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) following arthroscopic layered cancellous autograft bone and morselized allograft cartilage (Composite) grafting for osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) of the talus.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> An IRB-approved review of demographic and operative data, imaging, and prospectively collected PROs was accomplished. Consecutive patients treated for OCD of the talus (indicated for symptomatic, unstable lesions) with arthroscopic debridement, cancellous autografting, and morselized allograft cartilage (BioCartilage; Arthrex, Naples, FL) grafting (January 2015&#x2013;October 2022) were included. Preoperative and postoperative PROs were assessed using the Foot and Ankle Outcome Score (FAOS). The Magnetic Resonance Observation of Cartilage Repair Tissue (MOCART) 2.0 score was employed to assess postoperative MRIs.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Twenty ankles in 18 patients, (mean age of 14.5&#x2009;years; r&#x2009;=&#x2009;10.8&#x2013;17.9), 61.1% of whom were female, were treated with composite grafting with an average of 1.7&#x2009;year follow-up (1&#x2013;4.2&#x2009;years). Almost 81% of patients returned to sport at an average of 8.5&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;2.96&#x2009;months. The mean pretreatment lesion sizes were coronal width of 7.91 (4.6&#x2013;11.3)&#x2009;mm; sagittal length of 13.3 (4.4&#x2013;19.3)&#x2009;mm; and sagittal depth of 5.9 (3.9&#x2013;9.1)&#x2009;mm. Patient-reported FAOS scores significantly increased from pre- to post-treatment in all five domains: FAOS Daily Living (68.22&#x2013;94.21, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.00003), FAOS Pain (57.87&#x2013;89.58, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.00001), FAOS Quality of Life (25.69&#x2013;60.55, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001), FAOS Sports and Recreation (38.05&#x2013;76.25, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.00004), and FAOS Symptoms (63.29&#x2013;80.80, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.003). Postoperative MRIs were available in 15 (75%) ankles. All lesions demonstrated stable lesion filling with incorporated bony elements below the augmented fibrocartilage surface. A mean MOCART score of 66.7&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;14.9 reflected appropriate contour and stability of surface fibrocartilage with some signal irregularity of the fibrocartilage matrix. There was no significant correlation between MOCART scores, and PROs (p&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.05). There were no reoperations for graft failure or instability.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Statistically significant improvement in PROs were achieved after treatment of talar OCD with arthroscopic composite cancellous autograft and morselized cartilage allograft. MRIs demonstrated MOCART scores reflecting stable lesion fill and appropriate fibrocartilage contour.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Unstable talar OCDs present significant treatment challenges: debridement and marrow stimulation may result in poor lesion filling, and osteochondral allograft may be associated with significant operative morbidity and complications. Excellent outcomes may be achieved with arthroscopic composite cancellous autograft and morselized cartilage allograft in the treatment of talar OCD and may present significant utility over other surgical options.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Meniscal tears commonly occur concomitantly with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears. It is known that lateral meniscus tears are more commonly found acutely with ACL injury, while medial meniscal tears are more likely to be present within chronic ACL instability. Understanding the patient-specific factors that relate to meniscal tear location may help to optimize treatment strategies and patient outcomes. We hypothesized that patient weight and time from injury to surgery would be associated with varying meniscal tear location.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> We conducted a prospective study of pediatric patients treated with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) at two institutions. Surgical data were collected following ACLR, and we recorded meniscus injury location (medial, lateral, or both) for those who underwent a meniscus repair or meniscectomy. We compared the patient demographic, injury history, and injury characteristics between patients grouped into each meniscus tear location, and constructed logistic regression models to evaluate which predictors were associated with each tear location.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Of the 443 patients that were treated with ACLR, 268 underwent meniscus surgery: 21% with both lateral and medial meniscus injury (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;56; age&#x2009;=&#x2009;16.6&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1.7&#x2009;years; 43% female), 59% with a lateral meniscus injury only (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;158; 15.7&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;2.1&#x2009;years; 49% female), and 20% with medial meniscus injury only (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;54; 15.6&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1.7&#x2009;years; 59% female). Patients with both medial and lateral tears were significantly older and weighed more than those with medial or lateral injuries only, while those with a lateral meniscus tear only had a significantly shorter time from injury than the other two groups (Figure 1). In multivariable modeling, older age was associated with higher odds of both medial and lateral meniscus injuries, while longer time from injury to surgery was associated with higher odds of medial meniscus injury and both medial/lateral meniscus injury, and a lower odds of lateral meniscus injury (Table 1).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Consistent with the literature, we found that patients who had a longer time from injury to surgery were more likely to have medial meniscus tears at the time of ACLR. In addition, we found that higher age and higher weight in patients were both associated with having tears in both medial and lateral meniscus.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Our data suggest that the risk for medial meniscus tears should be considered as a potential consequence of delayed surgery. Additional research measuring meniscal tear pattern and comparison of surgical interventions would be beneficial to specify the level of risk to delayed ACLR.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> While sport-related injuries and surgery among youth are increasing, complication data following pediatric and adolescent knee arthroscopy are limited. The purpose of this study was to estimate the incidence of Grade III complications (unplanned reoperation or admission) and to identify the odds of these complications by associated risk factors.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Consecutive knee arthroscopic procedures (patients&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;19&#x2009;years old) with a minimum of 8&#x2009;months follow-up were queried from a multi-center quality improvement registry (28 contributing surgeons). Peri-operative variables, intra-operative techniques, and post-operative graded complications (Modified Clavien&#x2013;Dindo) were prospectively entered into an electronic data system. Descriptive statistics (frequencies, percentages, means, and standard deviations) were estimated by associated risk factors for Grade III complications overall and by type. Complication odds ratios were estimated with logistic regression analyses with restricted maximum likelihood.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 6139 (70.8%) patients were eligible from the registry, including 2261 (36.8%) anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions (ACL), 2115 (34.5%) ACL&#x2009;+&#x2009;meniscus repairs, 747 (12.2%) isolated meniscus repairs, 419 (6.8%) discoid meniscus repairs, 255 (4.2%) tibial spine repairs, and the remaining some other combination of the above. Most cases occurred in surgery centers (52.9%), among adolescents aged 13&#x2013;19&#x2009;years (83.9%), in males (54.4%), and in those with a healthy BMI (52.7%). Overall, 7.9% (98.6% reoperation; 1.7% readmission) of cases resulted in a Grade III complication (mean follow-up of 28&#x2009;months; range: 8&#x2013;56&#x2009;months). Within Grade III complications, 72.0% (348/483) were attributable to ligament graft or meniscal repair failure, or post-operative stiffness. Surgical assistant type was associated with an increased odd of a Grade III complication, including having an attending 2.64 (95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.31&#x2013;5.35) or fellow (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.97; 95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.10&#x2013;3.52), as compared to those cases with no assistant present. As compared to males, females were associated with 1.26 (95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.04&#x2013;1.51) times greater odds of a Grade III complication. Those who were classified as obese had 0.64 (95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.49&#x2013;0.82) times the odds of a Grade III complication compared with those classified as having a normal BMI.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Overall, 8% of pediatric and adolescent knee arthroscopy procedures resulted in a Grade III complication, with nearly 75% attributable to ligament graft or meniscal repair failure, or stiffness. Infection-related readmission or surgery rates were low.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Results from the SCORE registry suggest that reduction of reoperation or readmission following knee arthroscopy may be best focused on techniques to improve ligament graft and meniscal repair survival.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Patellar instability and dislocation are complex clinical and surgical challenges, especially in the pediatric population. This study focuses on congenital (fixed) and obligatory (habitual) dislocations, which present significant anatomical and etiological complexity, often leading to deformities and functional limitations. Conservative treatments are often inadequate, necessitating operative intervention. This retrospective study describes a surgical technique for treating both fixed (congenital) and obligatory (habitual) patellar dislocations.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> The surgical procedure involves extensive subperiosteal quadriceps realignment, distal realignment (Roux&#x2013;Goldthwait or tibial tuberosity transfer), and optional medial plication. The patients presented with various underlying diagnoses, such as Down syndrome, nail-patella syndrome, and skeletal dysplasia, were operated between 2002 to 2021 and comprise our study cohort. Our surgical procedure followed the principles described in 1976 by Stanisavljevic which involves subperiosteal quadriceps mobilization, thus minimizing both muscle damage bleeding and postoperative muscular adherences.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> We report 24 patients (age range: 5.5&#x2013;16.8&#x2009;years, 13 girls, 11 boys, 35 knees) whose mean follow-up duration was 8.2 (2.4&#x2013;20)&#x2009;years. All 24 patients demonstrated satisfactory improvements in patellar stability, range of motion, and quality of life. The average postoperative Pedi-IKDC score was 78.45&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;22.3 (range: 0&#x2013;100) where the syndromic patient with DiGeorge syndrome and the one with multiple epiphyseal dysplasia negatively affect the cumulative score (35 and 48, respectively).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The described surgical procedure yields favorable outcomes of patellar stability, range of motion, and quality of life. This paper presents our ongoing gained experience with the surgical technique for better and more reproducible results.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> The significance of the results presented in this abstract lies in providing insights into a surgical technique for treating congenital and obligatory patellar dislocations, which can be challenging conditions, particularly in pediatric patients. The positive outcomes in terms of improved patellar stability, range of motion, and quality of life suggest the effectiveness of the described surgical procedure. In addition, the study contributes to ongoing advancements in surgical techniques, aiming for better and more consistent outcomes, which can enhance the treatment of patellar instability and dislocation in this specific patient population.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Identifying anatomic risk factors for recurrent patella dislocations would help guide clinical decision-making and counseling for first-time dislocators. Many risk factors have been identified that increase the likelihood of patella instability, but little is known about risk stratification for recurrence of dislocation in individuals after a sentinel event. The purpose of this study is to determine if there are statistically significant differences in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements of patella instability (PI) in patients with a confirmed single dislocation versus those with multiple dislocations.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients between ages 9 and 25 at a tertiary care center (2012&#x2013;2023). Patients with prior surgery in the affected knee were excluded. Our recurrent cohort included patients with multiple prior dislocations and the non-recurrent cohort included patients with only one dislocation (without recurrence). All patients with a single dislocation were contacted by phone at final follow-up to confirm their status. Demographics and several (MRI) measurements, including tibial tubercle to proximal trochlear groove (pTT-TG), Caton&#x2013;Deschamps index (CDI), relative tibial external rotation (rTER), were collected. We also recorded the following measurements on proximal, cartilaginous surfaces to assess trochlear dysplasia: two-image lateral trochlea inclination angle (LTI), sulcus angle (SA), trochlear depth (TD). Statistical analyses included Mann&#x2013;Whitney U test and independent t-test with significance set as 0.05.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> In total, 184 patients (106 females, 78 males) were included in analyses. Around 111 belonged to the recurrent cohort and 73 were in the non-recurrent cohort. Overall recurrence rate was 60.32% and was significantly associated with greater trochlea dysplasia, rTER, and patella alta. LTI and pTT-TG were not associated with recurrent patella dislocation. Please see Table 1.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Patella alta, rTER, and measures of trochlear dysplasia, especially at proximal axial cuts, may be the most sensitive and reproducible predictors of recurrent patella dislocation. pTT-TG and LTI were not predictive for recurrence.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> There is a dearth of data reporting anatomical risk factor differences between patients who experience recurrent versus single patella dislocations. These results warrant further investigations to better counsel these patients moving forward.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Pediatric orthopedics faces a growing challenge in the United States due to the alarming rise in firearm violence among children and adolescents, particularly in urban areas, further emphasizing the need for effective prevention strategies. While numerous approaches have been proposed, consensus remains elusive. However, it is evident that victims of gun violence often concentrate in specific geospatial regions or &#x201C;hot spots.&#x201D; Understanding and analyzing these hot spots can provide valuable insights for targeted interventions to reduce firearm injuries in the pediatric population.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Our study utilized an online repository of geospatial datasets maintained by Philadelphia government agencies. We focused on gunshot wounds (GSWs) sustained by individuals under 18&#x2009;years of age from 2016 to 2022. We employed Maply to generate latitude and longitude points for each shooting. These points were transformed into a heat map, where the progression from green to yellow to red indicated increasing GSW frequency. Overlaying zip codes provided a more detailed understanding of these geospatial locations.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> From 2016 to 2022, 1063 children and adolescents suffered GSWs in Philadelphia. Notably, child injuries increased by 64%, and adolescent injuries surged by 126% over the study period. The most significant 1-year increase occurred from 2019 to 2020, coinciding with the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic. Heat map analysis revealed that the majority of pediatric GSWs occurred within specific clusters of zip codes, and these zip codes exhibited the most substantial increases in GSWs over time.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Pediatric orthopedic practitioners are facing a concerning 120% increase in gun violence cases in Philadelphia from 2016 to 2022. This surge affects both children and adolescents, with heat map analysis highlighting the persistent presence of specific geospatial &#x201C;hot spots.&#x201D; Understanding the dynamics of these hot spots is essential for developing effective targeted interventions to curb firearm injuries in the pediatric population.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Children and adolescents affected by GSWs require not only immediate medical care but also specialized, long-term rehabilitation to optimize their functional outcomes. Pediatric orthopedic surgeons are uniquely positioned to provide comprehensive care and play an active role in advocating for evidence-based policies and interventions to prevent pediatric firearm injuries. The significant increase in pediatric GSW in Philadelphia underscores the pressing need for specialized medical attention. These injuries often result in complex musculoskeletal trauma, making the expertise and advocacy efforts of pediatric orthopedic surgeons instrumental in addressing this growing public health concern and improving the lives of children and adolescents affected by firearm-related injuries.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Juxta-physeal fracture can lead to growth deformity, even without direct involvement of the physis. The classic example of this phenomenon is growth into valgus following proximal tibial fracture. Plate fixation can also induce similar growth disturbances, as seen in femoral shaft fractures. However, reports of such deformities following non-physeal radius fractures are notably infrequent. With the increasing use of volar plating for metaphyseal and diaphyseal fractures, it becomes crucial to understand potential growth disturbances. Therefore, our study aims to characterize growth deformity following volar plating of radius fractures.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A total of 315 skeletally immature patients who underwent volar plate fixation for radius fractures at a single children&#x2019;s hospital from 2008 to 2022 were analyzed. Patients with less than 4&#x2009;months of follow-up were excluded. Radiographic measurements including distal radial sagittal plane angle and plate-to-physis distance were obtained. Linear regression was performed to correlate apex volar deformity development with variables including patient age, plate-to-physis distance, concurrent ulnar fracture, and follow-up duration.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Of 61 patients who met inclusion criteria, a significant portion (41%) developed apex volar deformity (examples in Figure 1). This deformity was particularly prevalent in distal-third radius fractures with 78% demonstrating &#x2265;10&#xB0; of apex volar angulation and 44% exhibiting &gt;20&#xB0;. In contrast, middle- and proximal-third fractures showed considerably lower rates of deformity with only 13% and 0%, respectively, exhibiting &#x2265;10&#xB0; of angulation. Linear regression analysis demonstrated plate-to-physis distance and follow-up duration to be strong determinants of deformity (both p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Apex volar growth disturbance is a common deformity following distal radius volar plating in children with open physes. The operative technique, rather than the injury itself, is more likely the cause, considering the absence of such deformities reported with non-operative management or alternate fixation methods like Kirschner-wires. These findings instigate a paradigm shift in our understanding of how hardware influences longitudinal bone growth in children, as the deformity appears to be due to overgrowth on the volar side, where the plate is located, contradicting the traditional belief of growth impedance following plating. This necessitates further prospective investigations to accurately determine the incidence of deformity and unravel biology behind this phenomenon.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> These findings underscore the importance of vigilant post-operative monitoring for at least 6 months in children undergoing volar plating. The role of hardware removal to avoid this phenomenon is unknown. These findings challenge the traditional belief that plate fixation invariably causes growth arrest on the side of application; it may, in fact, stimulate growth.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Management of pediatric Gartland Type II extension supracondylar humerus (SCH) fractures has historically exhibited treatment variation. Our previous retrospective review of nonoperative management of Type II SCH fractures found both casting and flexion-taping achieved and maintained adequate reduction. Here we present the results of a prospective cohort of non-operatively managed Type II SCH fractures, examining whether there is a clinically significant difference in functional and radiographic outcomes between these two non-operative modalities.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Patients 2&#x2013;12&#x2009;years old who were managed nonoperatively for a Type II SCH fracture and presented within 8 weeks of injury at our center were enrolled. Demographic data collected included age, sex, and side of injury. Treatment data collected included non-operative method, need for reduction, changes in treatment, and complications. Radiographic parameters included the Lateral Humeral Capitellar Angle (LHCA), Baumann&#x2019;s angle, and adequacy of reduction. The primary outcome was change in LHCA and functional measurements included range of motion, Flynn&#x2019;s criteria, and QuickDASH. Secondary outcomes included the Pediatric Outcomes Data Collection Instrument (PODCI).</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> In total, 135 patients had at least 3 months of follow-up with sufficient documentation, with 90 receiving casting and 45 receiving taping. The demographics were similar between groups. Three patients in the casting group were converted to operative management. No patients received operative management in the taping group, but three were converted to casting. Complications were slightly higher in the casting group compared to the taping group (13.3% vs 11.1%). One patient in the taping group had AIN palsy at initial follow-up. There was one patient in each group reporting significant loss of range of motion at long-term follow-up. There was no statistically significant difference between the casting and taping groups for mean LHCA, Baumann&#x2019;s angle, QuickDASH score or Flynn&#x2019;s criteria. A slightly higher percentage of patients in the taping group was cleared for return to activity than the casting group at final follow-up. There was no significant difference between groups across all domains of the PODCI.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These findings suggest there is no clinically significant difference between both radiographic and patient-reported functional outcomes between the taping and casting groups in non-operatively managed Gartland type II supracondylar fractures.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This is consistent with previous retrospective data and supports the use of flexion-taping as an alternative to cast treatment of Type II SCH fractures; especially considering the added benefit of easier removal which can decrease patient anxiety and discomfort.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Displaced proximal humeral fractures in older children with low remodeling potential need to be reduced and fixed. There are many options for stabilization, including external fixation, rigid internal fixation with screws and plates, percutaneous pinning, and flexible intramedullary nailing. The use of two flexible retrograde nails, originated at the University of Nancy, France, became the most popular technique in Europe. The aim of this study was to describe and assess a modified, single retrograde nail technique to treat fractures of the proximal part of the humerus.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> We performed a retrospective monocentric study. From June 2016 to May 2019, a modified retrograde nail technique with 1 prebent nail was used for the management of 21 consecutive children with a closed displaced proximal humeral fracture. Demographic and surgical data were collected. The surgical technique is like the classic elastic stable intramedullary nailing, but only 1 nail is used. The average surgical time and perioperative complications were used as criteria for the feasibility of this technique. Radiographs were obtained preoperatively; at 1, 4, and 6&#x2009;weeks postoperatively; and after implant removal at an average of 4.2&#x2009;months postoperatively. The clinical outcomes were assessed based on the shoulder range of motion documented in the medical records and by using the French edition of the QuickDASH (shortened version of the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire) evaluation scale at the time of implant removal.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Nineteen patients with a mean age of 12.6&#x2009;years and a mean follow-up of 6&#x2009;months were included in the study. The mean surgical time was 49&#x2009;minutes. The single intramedullary nail technique provided a satisfactory reduction of all fractures. No perioperative complication occurred. In one case, partial loss of reduction was observed on the first-week control radiograph. All patients had a healed fracture, no deficits, excellent results according to the QuickDASH score, a normal range of motion, and excellent strength of the shoulder joint at the time of implant removal (at a mean of 4.2&#x2009;months).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This study confirms the feasibility and efficacy of the single retrograde intramedullary nail technique to treat displaced proximal humeral fractures in children.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> A single retrograde intramedullary nail technique is an alternative to double intramedullary fixation technique for treatment of displaced proximal humeral fractures in adolescents and in this case series proved to be an efficient method.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Traumatic posterior hip dislocations are typically managed by closed reduction. The presence of an acetabular &#x201C;fleck&#x201D; sign can signify significant hip pathology; despite its usual appearance as a small, displaced bony fragment on post-reduction computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a consistent pattern of osteochondral avulsion of the posterior and superior labrum has been described. The purpose of this study was to evaluate outcomes of open labral repair via surgical hip dislocation (SHD) in patients with an acetabular &#x201C;fleck&#x201D; sign following traumatic hip dislocation/subluxation.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective review was performed for patients who presented (2008&#x2013;2022) to a single, level 1 pediatric trauma center with a traumatic posterior hip dislocation/subluxation. Inclusion criteria: acetabular &#x201C;fleck&#x201D; sign and underwent labral repair via SHD. Surgical treatment included labral exploration and repair using suture anchors alone or supplementation with 3.5&#x2009;mm cortical screws. Electronic medical records (EMRs) were reviewed for demographics, laterality, mechanism of injury, associated orthopedic injuries, presence of heterotopic ossification, and complications. Patient/family completed the Modified Harris Hip Score (mHHS).</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Twenty-nine patients (23 male, average age:13.0&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;2.7&#x2009;years (range: 5.2&#x2013;17.3) were identified. Eighteen injuries were sports-related, nine caused by motor vehicle accidents, and one pedestrian-struck. Patients had an acetabular &#x201C;fleck&#x201D; sign on CT (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;26) or MRI (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;5). Associated injuries included: femoral head fracture (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;6), pelvic ring injury (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;3), ipsilateral femur fracture (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;2), and ipsilateral PCL avulsion (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;1). All patients returned to pre-injury activity/sport at final follow-up (1.9&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1.1&#x2009;years). Three patients developed asymptomatic, grade 1 heterotopic ossification in the greater trochanter region. There was no incidence of AVN. One patient developed post-traumatic acetabular dysplasia. mHHS showed excellent outcomes (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;21, 94.9&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;7.4, range: 81&#x2013;100.1).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Patients with an acetabular fleck sign who underwent SHD for traumatic posterior hip dislocation/subluxation showed excellent outcomes at 2&#x2009;years, with all patients returning to pre-injury activities and high self-reported functional outcomes.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> The acetabular &#x201C;fleck&#x201D; sign indicates a consistent pattern of osteochondral avulsion of the posterior/superior labrum. Restoring native hip anatomy and stability is likely to improve outcomes. SHD with open labral repair produces excellent clinical outcomes with no reported cases of AVN.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Fractures of the capitellum are uncommon in children. The purpose of this study was to report fracture characteristics, diagnostic pearls, treatment strategies, and outcomes at a large children&#x2019;s hospital. We also aimed to update the classification of these fractures based on a large sample size.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> In a retrospective study at a single tertiary-care children&#x2019;s hospital, fractures of the capitellum in patients&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;18&#x2009;years of age were queried and reviewed for demographic data, injury characteristics, imaging, treatment, and outcomes including complications. Three fellowship-trained pediatric orthopedic surgeons reviewed available imaging to classify the fractures per the Murthy (Boston) et al. classification system and, thereafter, employed the addition of a fourth subtype. Demographic statistics and Fleiss&#x2019;s kappa were used to analyze results.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> In total, 44 patients (25 male) who sustained capitellar fractures at a mean age of 11.7&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;3.7&#x2009;years were identified. Fractures were initially classified by the Murthy classification system including Types I&#x2013;III. Seven (16%) fractures did not belong to an existing type, and were grouped in a new Type IV, defined as LCL avulsions with extension to the articular surface of the capitellum (Figure 1). We found good to excellent inter- and intra-rater reliability (&#x3BA;&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.64 and 0.92, respectively) for the new modified classification system. Our raters believed that cross-sectional imaging was essential to classify fractures in 84% of cases. Three-quarters of our cohort (33/44, 75%) underwent early surgical intervention, with favorable post-operative range of motion (mean flexion 132.8&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;10.3&#xB0; and extension &#x2212;9.1&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;11.2&#xB0;). Five patients, all missed The Radiographic Appearance Seemed Harmless (TRASH) lesions, presented late with malunion, acting like an exostosis and blocking full extension. All were treated surgically with excision of the malunited posterior osseous fragment, with subsequent improvement in range of motion (mean extension &#x2212;7.0&#xB0;&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;10.3&#xB0;).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The modified Murthy classification of pediatric capitellar fractures is more comprehensive than the pre-existing system and offers good-to-excellent reliability. Cross-sectional imaging is critical in defining fracture patterns and characterizing TRASH lesions. We found excellent outcomes in most cases with early diagnosis and surgical management, but substantial risk for complications with missed or delayed diagnosis. Malunions resulting in an extension block can be effectively treated with fragment excision.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This is the largest study on pediatric capitellar fractures in the literature and provides an important update to the existing Murthy fracture classification. Recognizing TRASH lesions remains critical to avoiding capitellar malunion and joint contracture.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Femoral shaft fracture is a common injury that accounts for approximately 1.6% of all bony injuries in children. Rotational change after a flexible intramedullary (IM) nail for femoral shaft fracture has been a question for many surgeons. Recently, a statistical shape model (SSM) has been developed for the three-dimensional reconstruction of the femur from two-dimensional plain radiographs. In this study, we measured postoperative femoral anteversion (FAV) in patients diagnosed with femoral shaft fractures who were treated with flexible IM nails and investigated the changes in FAV with age using SSM.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> This study used radiographic data collected from six regional tertiary centers that specialize in pediatric trauma in South Korea. Patients who were diagnosed with femoral shaft fractures between September 2002 and June 2020 and pediatric patients aged&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;18&#x2009;years with at least two anteroposterior (AP) and lateral (LAT) femur plain radiographs obtained at least 3&#x2009;months duration apart were included. A linear mixed model (LMM) was adopted for statistical analysis.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Overall, 73 patients were included in the study. The average age of patients was 7.6&#x2009;years, ranging from 2.2 to 13.2&#x2009;years. The average duration of follow-up was 6.8&#x2009;years, ranging from 3 to 61&#x2009;months. The average FAV of immediate postoperative images was 27.5&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;11.5&#xB0;, which changed to 27.1&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;12.3&#xB0; at the last follow-up. With a 1-year increase in age at the time of trauma, FAV decreased by 0.9&#xB0; (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001) with a 1-year increase in age at the time of trauma. With every 1-year period after the initial surgery, the FAV decreased by 1.4&#xB0; (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.046).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This study explored changes in FAV after femoral shaft fracture using a newly developed technology that allows 3D reconstruction using uncalibrated 2D images. The expected FAV at skeletal maturity can be deduced based on the results of this study.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This study evaluated rotational changes after surgical treatment of femoral shaft fracture over time. The study utilized a new technology that enables analysis of femoral rotation without additional radiation exposure.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Lateral humeral condyle (LC) fractures are the second most common pediatric elbow fractures. Displaced fractures have been traditionally treated with open reduction although recent studies have demonstrated successful outcomes of closed reduction for some displaced fractures. This study investigates the outcomes comparing open and closed reduction in a large cohort of children with minimal-to-moderately displaced lateral humeral condyle fractures treated across six institutions.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Retrospective data from patients aged between 1 and 12&#x2009;years treated for lateral condyle fractures was collected from six academic level 1 trauma centers between 2005 and 2019. Data were collected on patient demographics, radiographic parameters, reduction type, type of hardware fixation, and fracture patterns. Complications recorded include infections, reoperations for nonunion, osteonecrosis, and elbow stiffness.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> An initial 762 fractures were identified. After excluding Song 5 cases, a total of 480 fractures met inclusion criteria, with 202 (42%) treated with closed reduction and 278 (58%) treated with open reduction. Demographics and injury characteristics were similar across the two reduction cohorts. Delayed union (52% vs 28%; odds ratio (OR) 2.88, 95% confidence interval (CI: 1.97&#x2013;4.22); p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001) and stiffness (22% vs 10%; odds ratio (OR): 2.42, 95% CI: 1.42&#x2013;4.13) p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0012) were significantly higher in the open-reduction group. No differences in the rates of infection or nonunion were noted between the two groups.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This study demonstrates that closed reduction decreases the likelihood of developing elbow stiffness and delayed healing when compared to open reduction in children with minimal-to-moderately displaced lateral humeral condyle fractures.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> The pronounced reduction in elbow stiffness and delayed union rates observed among the closed reduction cohort underscores the potential of this less-invasive technique in enhancing post-operative recovery.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> This retrospective study aims to characterize and assess the rates and risk factors of nerve injuries in pediatric Monteggia fracture dislocations.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> This single-center retrospective study involved pediatric patients who underwent operative reduction of Monteggia fracture dislocations between 2011 and 2021. We assessed nerve injuries, fracture and dislocation patterns, and demographics among Bado classifications. Radiographs were used to categorize the injury patterns. Nerve injuries were categorized into AIN, PIN, Radial, Ulnar, and Median palsies. Inclusion criteria were patients who failed non-sedated reduction.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 175 patients underwent operative reduction for Monteggia-dislocation fractures (mean age: 6.5&#x2009;years; 46.9% female). Nerve injuries were reported in 21.7% of patients. Patients with nerve injuries had an increased mean age of 1.76&#x2009;years (7.90 vs 6.14, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.003). No differences in gender, ethnicity, or body mass index (BMI) were observed (p&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.05). Lateral dislocations demonstrated an increased rate of PIN palsies (17.0%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.054) and radial nerve (RN) palsies (8.51%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.096). Lateral dislocations also accounted for 36.8% of all nerve injuries (incidence: 8%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.028). RN palsies occurred in 4% of patients (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;7), while ulnar nerve palsies were least common, affecting 4.0% of patients (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;2). The median time to symptom resolution was 47&#x2009;days in this cohort. Comminuted ulnar fractures demonstrated increased rates of PIN (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.016) and MN palsies (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.031). Importantly, 37.7% of comminuted ulna fractures involved nerve injury, comprising 52.6% of observed nerve injuries (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001). Of the 28 open fractures (16% of patients), AIN palsies occurred in 21.4% of cases (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001), and MN palsies in 10.7% of cases (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.030). Open injuries exhibited a higher rate of overall nerve injury compared to closed fractures (35.7% vs 19.0%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.05). Multivariate logistic regression revealed a significant effect of comminution and compound fractures on the risk of nerve injuries. Patients with comminution of the ulnar diaphysis had 1.99 times higher odds of nerve injury (95% CI, 1.275 to 3.114, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002). Moreover, regression models found that patients with compound fractures had 3.20 times higher odds of AIN palsy (95% CI, 1.619 to 6.316, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Surgeons should suspect a nerve injury when comminution of the ulnar diaphysis is identified in pediatric Monteggia fractures requiring operative reduction. Open Monteggia fractures are strongly associated with AIN palsies.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This study helps define the high rate of nerve injuries and association with different types of Monteggia fractures.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Lateral (LC) and olecranon condylar (OC) fractures occurring concurrently on one side are rare phenomena with limited scientific literature. Our study aims to evaluate the radiologic, clinical, and functional consequences of lateral to medial injury of the elbow (LAMEINE) in pediatric patients using the elbow performance score (EPS). In addition, the study aimed to distinguish this injury from medial to lateral injury of the elbow (MELAINE) and compare these two patterns of &#x201C;diagonal lesion&#x201D; injuries.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Eighteen males and 10 females were diagnosed with LAMEINE. The average age at the time of injury was 3.8&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;2.3 (range: 1&#x2013;9)&#x2009;years. Out of the 28 fractures, 19 (67.9%) occurred on the left side and 9 (32.1%) on the right side. The OC fractures were classified according to the Weiss system, 2 being type I, 17 type II, and 9 type III fractures. Based on the specific case characteristics, the OC fractures were further subcategorized into five types: 3 cases of type I fractures (10.7%), 16 cases of type II fractures (57.1%), 5 cases of type III fractures (17.9%), 2 cases of type IV fractures (7.1%), and 2 cases of type V fractures (7.1%). All patients underwent surgical intervention. Their clinical and functional outcomes were evaluated using the carrying angle (CA) and EPS. These results were then compared with those of our MELAINE patients.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> All patients were followed for a mean of 42.9&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;23.5 (range: 15&#x2013;88)&#x2009;months. Radiographs indicated that all fractures healed, on average, in 5.9&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1.4 (range: 4&#x2013;10)&#x2009;weeks. At the last follow-up, the CA and EPS of the injured side were 11.3&#xB0;&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;2.8&#xB0; and 97.7&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;3.7, respectively. All patients had favorable outcomes: 27 patients (96.4%) had excellent EPS, and only one patient (3.6%) had good EPS. The LAMEINE group displayed lower age, displacement, incidence of elbow dislocation, and CA than the MELAINE group (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Although relatively rare, LAMEINE should not be neglected. Surgical treatment aims to stabilize the elbow and avoid varus and deformity. With appropriate diagnosis and treatment, good clinical and radiographic outcomes can be achieved for both patterns of &#x201C;diagonal lesions&#x201D; of the pediatric elbow.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This is our series of studies on &#x201C;diagonal lesions&#x201D; of the pediatric elbow, the previous MELAINE has been published in Journal of Children&#x2019;s Orthopedics in January 2023, and this study LAMEINE is another injury corresponding to MELAINE.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Variability exists in rehabilitation protocols for displaced supracondylar humerus (Type-III) fractures. Some providers utilize a removable splint for a short time following pin removal. This study aims to evaluate the effect of physical therapy (PT) and post-pin-pull splinting protocols on the time to return of elbow motion following operative fixation of Type III fractures.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> An IRB-approved retrospective study was conducted of patients&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;18&#x2009;years old undergoing pinning of a Type III fracture at a tertiary children&#x2019;s hospital from January 2013 to January 2020. Extension (0&#xB0;&#x2013;30&#xB0;) and flexion (&#x2265;130&#xB0;) achieved by 1&#x2009;year were analyzed separately. Patients with screw fixation, additional injuries, inadequate documentation, and refractures/incomplete recovery &lt;1&#x2009;year were excluded. Demographic data, treatment characteristics, days to extension/flexion and PT referrals were recorded. Patients were grouped by the duration of use of removable splints following pin removal (performed between 3&#x2013;4&#x2009;weeks): Protocol-1 (P1): None/1&#x2009;week, Protocol-2 (P2): 2/3&#x2009;weeks, Protocol-3 (P3): 4+&#x2009;weeks. Statistical analysis was performed using analysis of variance (ANOVA), chi-squared test, Fisher Exact Test, Mann&#x2013;Whitney U-test, and Kruskal&#x2013;Wallis Test.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 435 Type III fractures were included with a mean age of 6.1&#x2009;years, noting one refracture (0.1%, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;1/592) in the protocol 2 group which was excluded. Patients with extension and flexion data were 434 and 350 patients, respectively. No difference was noted by demographic, injury and operative factors in the extension and flexion cohorts (p&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.05). Longer follow-up was required for P2/P3 vs P1 (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Controlling for PT, both extension (35 vs 28 vs 28&#x2009;days) and flexion return (55 vs 35 vs 28&#x2009;days) were delayed P3 versus P2 versus P1 (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001 for both) (Table 1 and 2). PT referral was not effective in accelerating extension recovery overall using any splinting protocol (p&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.05) and was associated with a longer time to flexion return overall (PT vs No PT, 59 vs 34&#x2009;days) and in P1 (PT vs No PT, 49 vs 28&#x2009;days, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) and P2 (PT vs No PT, 66 vs 35&#x2009;days, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) protocols.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Splinting&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;2/3&#x2009;weeks following pin-pull led to faster recovery of elbow motion in Type III fractures. Extended splinting of 4+&#x2009;weeks led to longer follow-up periods. PT referrals showed no beneficial effect on return of elbow motion.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Using a brief period of immobilization or avoiding immobilization altogether may expedite elbow motion recovery, avoiding PT intervention and additional follow-up, without increasing the risk of refracture.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Emphasis on bone health for fracture prevention has largely focused on post-menopausal women; however, the significance of low vitamin D in pediatric fracture studies has received much less attention. While vitamin D supplementation is not preventive of fragility fractures in older patients, few studies have evaluated its effect on fracture occurrence in growing children. We investigate whether vitamin D levels affect pediatric fracture occurrence.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective cohort study was conducted to determine the effect of vitamin D levels on fracture occurrence using an aggregate electronic health record network of &gt;95 million patients. Patients with low vitamin D were confirmed by two sequential lab findings of deficient vitamin D levels (&lt;20&#x2009;ng/mL). Patients were categorized based on age (5&#x2013;9&#x2009;year, 10&#x2013;14&#x2009;years, 15&#x2013;18&#x2009;years) and fracture location (upper, lower extremity). A single-institution prospective cohort study of 55 patients was performed was performed to identify contributors to fracture occurrence including mechanism of injury (low vs high energy), type of injury (fracture, sprain/strain, no injury), body mass index (BMI), diet, and seasonal differences.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Vitamin D-deficiency was associated with increased fracture occurrence in all age groups, with the largest effect in peripubertal children ages 10&#x2013;14&#x2009;years (Figure 1). Vitamin D-deficient children subsequently treated with supplemented cholecalciferol demonstrated fracture rates equivalent to vitamin D-sufficient children. For the prospective cohort, there were no significant differences in serum vitamin D levels among uninjured children, injured children without fracture, injured children with a fracture. Subset analysis revealed a significant difference in vitamin D levels between injured children with a fracture sustained by a low energy mechanism versus a high energy mechanism (19.8 vs 30.6&#x2009;ng/mL, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.029).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Low vitamin D is associated with increased fracture risk in pediatric patients who sustain low energy mechanisms of injury. Vitamin D supplementation may decrease fracture risk in vitamin D-deficient children.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> These results may shift clinical practice to recommend supplementary vitamin D as a safe, cost-effective intervention to prevent pediatric fractures and improve bone health.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Many pediatric fractures are managed with closed reduction and casting. Maintenance of adequate reduction is imperative to successful nonoperative management. The advent of waterproof casting materials has provided an alternative to standard cotton liners, with literature suggesting increased patient satisfaction and reduced frequency of cast changes. These characteristics make waterproof casting an attractive option for closed fracture management; prompting the question regarding the ability to maintain fracture reduction with waterproof casting.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A single-institution retrospective chart review was performed analyzing 169 pediatric patients with non-operative upper or lower extremity fractures who received either standard cast padding (standard) or waterproof cast liner (waterproof) with fiberglass from 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2021. The change in radiographic anteroposterior (AP) angulation and translation as well as lateral angulation and translation from initial fracture reduction to cast removal was calculated and compared between groups. Chi-square and Fischer&#x2019;s exact tests were used to compare categorical variables, and generalized linear models were used to compare continuous variables.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total 169 cases were included; 153 (90.5%) had standard casts and 16 (9.5%) had waterproof casts at their initial management. The mean age at fracture was 8.5 (&#xB1;3.43) with 165 (97.6%) upper extremity fractures. There were no significant differences in demographic factors and comorbidities between groups. The mean change in AP angulation and translation after cast removal was 1.43&#xB0;&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;3.86&#xB0; and &#x2212;0.39&#x2009;mm&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1.08&#x2009;mm, respectively. There was no significant difference in AP angulation and translation across fracture locations (metacarpals, radius only, radius and ulna, tibia and fibula) or between cast materials. The mean change in lateral angulation and translation after cast removal was 0.85&#xB0;&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;5.13&#xB0; and &#x2212;0.14&#x2009;mm&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1.25&#x2009;mm, respectively. There was no significant difference in lateral angulation and translation across fracture locations or between different between cast materials. Change in angulation was almost 10 times larger in patients who required 2 cast changes than in those who did not need a cast change (3.56&#xB0;&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;5.69&#xB0; vs 0.36&#xB0;&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;5.05&#xB0;, respectively) though did not reach significance (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.074).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These data demonstrate that there was no significant difference between casting materials in relation to fracture displacement with casting management. This is a pilot study which suggests that waterproof casting may be a reliable choice for reduction maintenance.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> No study to date has compared reduction maintenance between standard cotton and waterproof casting materials. As studies have demonstrated improved patient satisfaction with these materials, it is necessary to pair these reassuring outcomes with maintenance of reduction.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Elastic stable intramedullary nail (ESIN) has revolutionized the treatment of pediatric femoral shaft fractures. The logistics and limitations of the technique continue to deserve attention. We sought to identify predictors of malunion and major complications in a large cohort of pediatric femoral shaft fracture patients treated via ESIN.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective chart and X-ray review was performed for children whose shaft fractures were treated via ESIN from 2000 to 2022. Included patients had to have complete perioperative information and at a minimum radiographic and clinical follow-up until fracture healing (defined by minimum 3 out of 4 bridged cortices and RUST scoring). Patients with bone fragility disorders or pathologic fractures were excluded. Primary outcome variables were malunion (age adjusted) and major complications (Clavien&#x2013;Dindo grade 3&#x2013;5). Predictor variables included fracture stability (defined by both fracture ratio method and Winquist grading of comminution), age, weight, and metallurgy (stainless steel vs titanium). Univariate and multivariate statistical techniques were applied. Power analysis revealed 80% power to detect a 20% difference in outcome variables.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> The study included 273 children (206 male, 67 female) and 277 closed fractures, 1 open grade III (5 bilateral). Average age at the time of injury was 8&#x2009;years 5&#x2009;months (range: 3&#x2013;16&#x2009;years) and average weight was 31 (range: 13&#x2013;64)&#x2009;kg. Average times were 15 hours between hospital arrival and surgery, 58&#x2009;min procedure time, 3.5-day length of stay (LOS), 9&#x2009;weeks until radiographic union (corresponding RUST 9/12), and 5.9&#x2009;months until nail removal. There was a 7.9% (22/278) rate of ORIF, with 73% (16/22) being transverse fractures and average EBL 49 cc. There was a 2.9% (8/273) rate of supplemental casting. Using either definition neither univariate nor multivariate analysis identified fracture stability as a predictor of malunion (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.065) or major complications (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.997). Multivariate modeling revealed that older age (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.042) and titanium nails (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.011) predicted malunion and older age alone (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) predicted major complications.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Neither definition of fracture stability (fracture ratio method or Winquist) predicted malunion or major complications. Older age and titanium nails predicted malunion and older age predicted major complications.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This study adds to existing literature supporting use of ESIN in unstable fracture patterns. It also reconfirms titanium nails as a risk factor for malunion and older (presumably heavier) patients being at risk for malunion and major complications.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Elastic stable intramedullary nail (ESIN) has been applied to a spectrum of pediatric fractures including tibial shaft fractures. The logistics and limitations of the technique continue to deserve attention. We sought to identify predictors of malunion and major complications in a large cohort of pediatric tibial shaft fracture patients treated via ESIN.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective chart and X-ray review was performed for children whose shaft fractures were treated via ESIN from 2006 to 2023. Included patients had to have complete perioperative information and at a minimum radiographic and clinical follow-up of 6&#x2009;months or until fracture healing (defined by minimum 3 out of 4 bridged cortices and RUST scoring). Patients with bone fragility disorders or pathologic fractures were excluded. Nonunion was defined as less than three bridged cortices at 6&#x2009;months. Primary outcome variables were malunion (age adjusted) &amp; major complications (Clavien&#x2013;Dindo grade 3&#x2013;5). Predictor variables included fracture stability (defined by both fracture ratio method and Winquist grading of comminution), age, weight, and open versus closed fracture. Univariate and multivariate statistical techniques were applied.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> The study included 164 children (123 male, 41 female) with unilateral fractures, 130 of which had associated fibular fractures. There were 113 closed fractures (24% required open reduction) and 51 open fractures (10 grade III). Average age at the time of injury was 12&#x2009;years 2&#x2009;months (range 4&#x2013;16)&#x2009;years and average weight was 53 (range: 18&#x2014;109)&#x2009;kg. Using each definition 33%&#x2013;35% of fractures were unstable. Average follow-up was 1&#x2009;year 5&#x2009;months (range: 6&#x2009;month to 6&#x2009;years). Nails were removed from 92% (151/164) patients at an average of 9&#x2009;months (range: 7 weeks to 3.5&#x2009;years). There was a 9% (15/164) nonunion rate, 15% (24/164) malunion rate, and 9% (15/164) major complication rate (including five compartment syndromes). Multivariate analysis revealed that greater weight was the sole predictor (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.05) of malunion with patients &gt;34&#x2009;kg (75 lbs) at 3.5 times higher risk malunion (95% CI: 1.01, 10.41). Greater weight (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002) and III/IV Winquist comminution (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02) predicted nonunion. Open treatment (either open fracture or open treatment closed fracture) predicted major complications (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.004).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Patients&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;34&#x2009;kg (75 lbs) were at higher risk of malunion and heavier patients and those with greater comminution were more likely to demonstrate incomplete union at 6&#x2009;months.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This study raises concern about ESIN in heavier tibial shaft fracture patients and applying the technique in settings where otherwise closed fractures might require open reduction.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Treating tibial fractures in skeletally immature patients offers unique challenges. Rigid intramedullary fixation poses risks of premature physeal closure. Flexible nails are not suitable for obese patients, unstable, or non-diaphyseal fractures. Plate osteosyntheses has potential wound healing difficulties and post-operative weight-bearing restrictions. Minimally invasive circular external fixation (CEF) allows immediate weight-bearing, early range of motion of nearby joints and the use of computer software for adjusting post-operative fracture alignment. The purpose of the study was to evaluate outcomes as well as cost for adolescent tibia shaft fractures treated with CEF.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> This was an IRB-approved multicenter retrospective case series of adolescent patients with tibial shaft fractures treated with CEF aged 10&#x2013;17&#x2009;years between 2010 and 2021. Other treatment methods were excluded. Patient demographics, radiographic, functional outcomes, and financial data were investigated.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Trauma registry identified 352 cases of adolescent tibia fractures. Further screening showed 38 of cases treated with CEF. The average patient age was 14&#x2009;years, with 76% (29/38) being male. The average duration of CEF treatment was 4&#x2009;months, and patients were followed up for 7&#x2009;months. Twelve (31%) were open fractures, and 21 (55%) of the patients with CEF treatment developed pin site infections. The average RUST score was 10. All fractures healed with less than 10&#xB0; of deviation in all directional planes. Open fractures were associated with higher energy mechanisms of injury (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), additional operative procedures (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.008), and larger sagittal deviation (10.30&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;0.42, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;2; 4.45&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;3.35, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;8; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.049). Larger coronal deviation degrees were linked to complications (5&#xB0;&#xB1;&#x2009;2, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;4 versus 2&#xB0;&#xB1;&#x2009;1, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;7; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.037). There was a statistically significant difference in RUST scores based on proximal physis maturity, with a mean of 10 in the open fracture group and 9 in the closed fracture group (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.027). The median and interquartile ranges for the total cost of the procedures were $75 k and $26 k, respectively.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> CEF for adolescent tibial shaft fractures offers unique advantages for adolescent patients. Throughout this multicenter study, CEFs were shown to provide full weight-bearing and early range of motion with minimal complications. Pin site infections were the most common complication and correlated positively with secondary procedures. CEFs allowed for minimal angulation or translation in all patients with no cases of nonunion or decreased range of motion.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> CEF for adolescent tibial shaft fractures resulted in successful pain free osseous union without increased complications or need for secondary procedures.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Waterproof casting materials entered the marketplace with a focus on improving the patient experience over standard cast padding. Previous literature has shown increased patient satisfaction, reduced discomfort, and decreased cast changes with waterproof casts. This study aims to investigate the economic impact of waterproof casting in pediatric patients with non-operative extremity fractures.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A single institution retrospective chart review was performed analyzing 1038 pediatric patients with non-operative upper or lower extremity fractures who received either standard cast padding or waterproof cast padding from 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2021. Generalized linear models were used to estimate cost differences for material cost, patient charges, and profit. Incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) was used to compare the cost and number of unplanned cast changes between groups.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Of the 1038 cases included, 862 (83%) had standard casts, and 176 (17%) had waterproof casts placed as initial treatment. A significant difference existed between the price of materials with the estimated cost of waterproof casts being, on average, $16.29 more than standard casts (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001). While the estimated patient charge was not significantly different between materials, profits from initially placed standard casts were, on average, significantly higher than waterproof casts, with a mean difference of $10.56 per cast placed (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001). Despite this, the probability of requiring an unplanned cast change was significantly higher with standard casts than with waterproof casts at 41.18% versus 9.09%, respectively (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Similarly, ICER for material cost and patient charge, showed a relative decrease in material cost expenditures and patient charges of $149.08 and $55.53 per avoidance of each unplanned cast change, respectively, when waterproof casts are used. ICER also estimated an increase of $90.35 in expected profit per avoidance of each unplanned cast change with the implementation of waterproof casts.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This study suggests that the reduced likelihood of cast replacement with waterproof casts may lead to decreased patient charges and material cost expenditures, resulting in both increased hospital profits as well as decreased patient costs compared to standard materials. Utilization of waterproof casting has the potential to increase the value of care provided to patients.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> No study to date has produced data on the financial implications on the health system or to patients when switching to waterproof casting materials. As healthcare transitions toward a value-based care model, selecting materials that offer optimal outcomes at a lower cost becomes increasingly important for both healthcare systems and patients.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Social deprivation levels and racial disparities influence hospitalization utilization following closed reduction and percutaneous pinning (CRPP) of supracondylar humerus (SCH) fractures. We found that the patients who were the most socially deprived were more likely to visit the ED and that patients who identify as Black were less likely to attend orthopedic office visits. Identifying risk factors for discrepancies in hospital utilization following SCH fracture fixation can help mitigate unnecessary healthcare spending and reduce overall hospital burden. Identifying perioperative predictors of healthcare utilization is of particular interest to surgeons to mitigate cost and improve patient outcomes. The aim of this study is to elucidate the effect of social deprivation, using the Area Deprivation Index (ADI), on hospital utilization within 90&#x2009;days of CRPP following SCH fractures. The effect of social deprivation on healthcare utilization has not been fully characterized in the pediatric population.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> This is a retrospective review of a single institution&#x2019;s experience with CRPP of SCH fractures between 2010 and 2023. Demographic variables (age, race, and gender) and healthcare utilization data (hospital readmission, emergency department visits, follow-up visits, and telephone calls) were recorded within 90&#x2009;days of surgery. The ADI was recorded, and patients were separated into terciles according to their relative level of social deprivation. Outcomes were then stratified based on ADI tercile.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 1186 patients were included in this study. The upper, middle, and lower terciles of ADI consisted of 226, 458, and 502 patients, respectively. The most deprived tercile had greater emergency department visitation within 90&#x2009;days of surgery relative to the least and intermediate deprived terciles (RR: 1.9, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1&#x2013;3.3). Identifying as Black was an independent risk factor for decreased outpatient clinic utilization (RR: 0.9, 95% CI: 0.8&#x2013;0.9). Higher levels of social deprivation were independent risk factors for increased ED visitation. There was no difference in 90-day inpatient readmission rates or telephone calls made to the clinic between terciles.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Patients with higher levels of social deprivation demonstrated greater postoperative hospital utilization in the form of greater unscheduled ED visits within 90&#x2009;days of surgery. Patients identifying as Black had decreased rates of outpatient clinic utilization.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This study sheds light on how social determinants of health impact the postoperative care of pediatric patients and which patient populations are most at risk for disproportionate resource utilization after pinning of SCH fractures. Understanding these differences may lead to improved patient outcomes while decreasing the burden on the healthcare system.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Monteggia fracture dislocations are complex injuries with high complications rates. This retrospective study aimed to assess the efficacy of various implant options and their associated complications in pediatric Monteggia fracture dislocations.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> This single-center retrospective study involved pediatric patients who underwent surgical management of Monteggia fracture-dislocations between 2011 and 2021. We assessed demographics, Bado Classification, characteristics of ulna fracture, surgical techniques, implant usage, and complications. Patients older than 18 at surgery were excluded.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 175 patients who underwent operative reduction (mean age: 6.5&#x2009;years; 46.9% female) were studied. The median follow-up duration was 5.6&#x2009;months with 11% of patients lost to follow-up. Ulnar fixation was accomplished using Steinmann pins, intramedullary (IM) flexible nails, or plates in 46.3%, 35.9%, and 16.4% of cases, respectively. No significant differences were observed in age or Bado classification between treatment groups (p&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.05). Radio-capitellar joint required open reduction in 10.9% of operations. Implant prominence was reported in 7.01% of pins, 28.3% of nails, 46.7% of plates (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). The rate of implant removal secondary to prominence was highest in patients with plates with 47.6% of patients requiring removal (vs 28.3% of nails, 7.01% of pins, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Notably, plates exhibited a higher rate of revision surgery due to malunion, infection, and refracture, with a rate of 14.2% of cases (vs 0% of nails, 1.8% of pins, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.015). Overall implant removal rates, including planned procedures and symptomatic implants, occurred in 22.8% of pins, 75.1% of nails, and 81.0% of plates (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Importantly, 19.0% of fractures treated with plates had persistent dislocation (vs 1.8% of pins vs 0% of nails, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.003). Other complications included bursa formation (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;5), refractures (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;2), dehiscence (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;3), and non-union (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;1).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Ulnar plates had a significantly increased rate of complications and comprised most post-operative complications. This may be due to severity of initial injury. IM nails also demonstrated an elevated risk of complications.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Surgeons should consider implant selection carefully to minimize reoperation rates and complications in Monteggia fracture dislocations.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Lateral condyle fractures are the second most common pediatric elbow fracture. Several studies have looked at short-term outcomes, but no studies to date have followed into adulthood. The purpose of this study is to use a population-based database to identify the incidence and long-term complications of lateral condyle fractures. Our hypothesis was that lateral condyle fractures would not have significant long-term complications.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A population-based database was used to identify patients who sustained a lateral condyle fracture under the age of 18 from 1966 to 2012. Electronic medical records were reviewed for clinical and radiographic data at the time of treatment and up to their latest follow-up. Analysis was performed to determine the incidence of pediatric lateral condyle fractures as well as long-term complications.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> From 1966 to 2012, 227 patients with a pediatric lateral condyle fracture were identified, and 78% had at least 10-year follow-up. Age and sex-adjusted incidence rate was found to be 13.97 per 100,000 overall, 6.33 per 100,000 for displaced fractures, and 4.50 per 100,000 for non-displaced fractures. Using the Weiss classification, we identified 45% type 1, 34% type 2, and 21% type 3 fractures. Nonoperative treatment was pursued in 100% of type 1, 59% of type 2, and 11% of type 3 fractures. The overall complication rate was 25% (45/178). Of these complications, 35% (16 of 45) occurred after 10&#x2009;years (Figure 1). The most common complications were lateral overgrowth and malunion, followed by fishtail deformity, stiffness, and lateral epicondylitis. The majority of complications occurring within 1-year included lateral overgrowth (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;7), while the majority of complications occurring beyond 10&#x2009;years included malunion (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;7). Five patients required revision surgery. There was a significant increase in complication rate for Type 2 (23%; 14 of 61) and Type 3 (35%; 13 of 37) fractures compared to Type 1 (10%; 8 of 80; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.003).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This population-based study estimated the overall incidence of pediatric lateral condyle fractures to be 14 per 100,000 with a higher incidence of displaced versus nondisplaced fractures. Displaced fractures were at higher risk for long-term complications. Overall long-term complications beyond 10&#x2009;years are low, but still present therefore proper education is necessary at the time of injury.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> The incidence of pediatric lateral condyle fractures is 14 per 100,000 with an overall complication rate of 25%. A higher rate of complications occurred with displaced fractures, and 35% occurred beyond 10&#x2009;years from injury.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> The treatment of supracondylar humerus (SCH) fractures is increasingly centralized to tertiary centers. Interfacility transfer from other facilities may occur by ground ambulance or privately owned vehicle (POV). The objective of this study was to determine if interfacility transfer by POV is equivalent to ground ambulance.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> This was a single-institution, retrospective study of SCH fractures with an intact pulse transferred by POV or ground ambulance. Transfer timepoints were collected to determine transfer time and speed. Associated injuries of ipsilateral fracture, skin at risk, and motor nerve palsy were recorded from orthopedic documentation at presentation. Insurance status and the Area Deprivation Index (ADI) were used as measures of socioeconomic disparity.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 676 &#x201C;urgent&#x201D; Type III, IV, and flexion type SCH fractures, and 167 &#x201C;non-urgent&#x201D; Type II SCH fractures were transferred by ambulance or POV. Open reduction was similar between urgent transfers transported by ambulance or POV (10% vs 9%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.344). There was no difference in transfer time (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.391) or transfer speed (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.416) between transfer groups. POV transfers were independently associated with no skin at risk (odds ratio (OR) 2.1; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.3&#x2013;3.3, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.003), neurovascularly intact (OR 2.5; 95% CI: 1.4&#x2013;4.4, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001), commercial insurance compared to Medicaid (OR 2.1; 95% CI: 1.5&#x2013;3.0, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), self-insured compared to Medicaid ( OR 4.9; 95% CI: 1.7&#x2013;14, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.003), and patients in the first (OR 1.9; 95% CI: 1.3&#x2013;2.5, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.041) and middle terciles of ADI (OR 1.9; 95% CI: 1.1&#x2013;3.5, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.034) compared to the third tercile of ADI.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Interfacility transfer of non-emergent SCH fractures by POV has similar speed of transfer and complication rate to transfer by ground ambulance.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Our findings allow triaging of non-emergent SCH fractures for potential interfacility transfer by POV and bring attention to disparities in interfacility transfer methods.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Pediatric orthopedic surgeons are acquainted with fracture patterns due to child abuse. There has been a recent interest in intimate partner violence (IPV) among orthopedic surgeons; however, there is no specific study regarding teenager IPV victims. As pediatric orthopedic surgeons care for fractures in teenagers, it is important to understand IPV injury patterns in teenagers, allowing for recognition and intervention. It was the purpose of this study to fill this information gap.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) All Injury Program (AIP) 2005 through 2020 was used. This is a stratified, weighted dataset which collects data from ~ 65 U.S. hospitals with an ED. With appropriate statistical techniques, national estimates are obtained. All patients seen for IPV were extracted. Standard demographic and injury variables were analyzed. This study was considered exempt by our local IRB.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> There were an estimated 3,107,381 ED visits for IPV. These were grouped into 67,844 adolescents (2.2%) (ADOL), 831,752 emerging adults (27.6%) (EAP), and 2,118,234 adults (70.2%) (ADLT). Fractures occurred in 3.9% of the ADOL, 7.5% of the EAP, and 9.8% the ADLT (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001) patients. There were more head/neck fractures in ADOL (69%) compared to EAP (57.2%) and ADLT (48.9%) (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001). While rare, cervical spine fractures comprised 4.7% of the head/neck fractures among ADOL, and 1.2% in the other age groups. Fractures of the finger and hand were predominant among adolescents, accounting for 89.4% of all their upper extremity fractures, compared to 65.9% of EAP and 51.1% of ADLT. Fractures of the tibia/fibula were the most common type of lower extremity fractures in ADOL (48%) with a lower representation in EAP (24.8%) and ADLT (20.6%). The second most common type of lower extremity fracture in ADOL were toe fractures, accounting for 42.9% of their lower extremity fractures, compared to 24% and 16.1% in EAP and ADLT.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> IPV-related fractures among ADOL were more likely to impact the head and neck, hand and finger, and lower leg compared to older IPV patients. Pediatric orthopedic surgeons should be aware of the unique characteristics of IPV in different age groups. While injuries were generally less severe among adolescents, this is the ideal time to interrupt the progression to more severe violence.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> When the history is questionable regarding fractures of the cervical spine, hand/fingers, tibia/fibula and toes, suspicion of IPV should occur. This is similar to suspect fractures in infants for child abuse.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Tibial shaft fractures represent a common adolescent fracture. Most surgeons utilize elastic intramedullary nails (EINs) or plate and screw constructs when operative fixation is indicated in skeletally immature patients. Rigid intramedullary nails (RIMNs) require reaming across the anterior proximal tibial physis leading to concern for iatrogenic physeal injury and subsequent development of recurvatum. Currently, there is little evidence evaluating the outcomes of RIMN in skeletally immature patients despite wide adoption in adults. This study aims to determine if RIMN are a safe means of treating tibial shaft fractures in skeletally immature adolescent patients.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Retrospective chart review was performed of tibial shaft fractures undergoing RIMN within a single pediatric orthopedic group between 2012 and 2022. Patients with closed physes were excluded. Intraoperative medial proximal tibial angle (MPTA) and posterior proximal tibial angle (PPTA), implant position relative to physis, and follow-up MPTA and PPTA were recorded. Intraoperative and postoperative measurements were compared using a paired sample t-test at significance level of 0.05. Change in MPTA and PPTA based on implant location was assessed using a two-sample t-test at significance level of 0.05.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Twenty-three patients were included. Mean age at surgery was 14.4&#x2009;years. Mean follow-up was 14.7&#x2009;months. There was no statistically significant difference between mean intra- and post-operative MPTA (87.348 vs 86.826, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0967) nor PPTA (81.087 vs 82.000, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.352). There was a statistically significant difference in absolute change in PPTA between patients with implant placed proximal versus distal to the physis (0.944 vs 5.600, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.026). The difference was no longer statistically significant after excluding one patient who developed recurvatum after RIMN. The patient&#x2019;s intraoperative MPTA and PPTA were 87 and 83&#xB0; compared with 85 and 104&#xB0; at 31-month follow-up.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The use of RIMN in skeletally immature adolescents did not lead to a statistically significant change in MPTA or PPTA indicative of growth disturbance. One patient developed sagittal recurvatum after RIMN with the implant positioned distal to the physis. There was not a statistically significant difference in absolute change in PPTA based on final implant position after exclusion of this outlier.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Although RIMN are generally safe and effective in treating tibial shaft fractures in skeletally immature adolescents, we demonstrate a non-zero risk of sagittal recurvatum by including, to our knowledge, the first published incidence of recurvatum following RIMN for an adolescent tibial shaft fracture. Further studies are needed to elucidate risk factors for growth arrest, including final implant position.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> The most frequent complication of pediatric lateral condyle fractures is lateral overgrowth which occurs in up to 73%&#x2013;100% of patients. The purpose of our study is to further investigate lateral overgrowth in relation to age, quality of reduction, type of fixation, and fracture displacement using the Song classification.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> We retrospectively analyzed operatively treated lateral condyle fractures in children. Patient charts were used to collect information on demographics, type of hardware used, and date of fixation. The percent change in inter-epicondylar width (IEW) ((final &#x2013; initial)/initial &#xD7; 100) was used to quantify the extent of lateral overgrowth. IEW was measured from the medial and lateral epicondyles of the distal humerus, using the AP radiographic images taken at admission (initial) and follow-up visits (final). The Song classification was used to classify the fractures. The quality of reduction was defined as anatomic or non-anatomic (&gt;2&#x2009;mm of displacement). Means and frequencies were calculated to describe the patient characteristics (i.e. age, sex, race). Data were analyzed using Pearson&#x2019;s correlation, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and multivariable linear regression.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> There were 204 patients included in the study (62.7% male, 37.3% female) with an average time between initial and final radiograph measurements of 11.24 (&#xB1;8.01) weeks. The racial demographic of the group consisted of 82.8% White, 14.2% Black, 1.47% Asian, and 1.47% Other. Patients had an average age of 4.92 (&#xB1;2.08) years. The most common type of hardware used was screw (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;109) followed by pin (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;65) and screw and pin (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;30). The most common type of reduction was anatomic (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;183) followed by nonanatomic (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;21). The most common Song classification in the study was class 4 (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;112) followed by class 5 (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;76) and class 3 (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;16). Using multivariable analysis, three variables demonstrated significant, independent associations with percent lateral condyle overgrowth (%LCO): age, race, and type of reduction. Increasing age remained inversely associated with %LCO. Compared to White patients, Black patients had significantly greater %LCO. Finally, patients with non-anatomic reductions had a significantly greater %LCO compared to anatomic reductions.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The amount of lateral overgrowth was found to be related to non-anatomic reduction, younger age, and Black race. Interestingly, it was not related to the amount of initial displacement (Song classification) or type of hardware used.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> To date, this will be the largest study investigating lateral overgrowth in surgically treated lateral condyle fractures.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Pediatric lateral humeral condyle fractures (LHCFs) have predominantly been treated with open surgery. However, studies have shown that undisplaced stable fractures may be safely treated non-operatively. Plain radiographs do not show the chondral part of the distal humerus and cannot be used to evaluate the extension and stability of LHCF. Unstable fractures can secondarily displace in up to 40% of cases within the first 5&#x2013;7&#x2009;days. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been shown to clearly visualize this injury&#x2019;s extension into the chondro-epiphysis but has previously required sedation or anesthesia. This study examined an MRI treatment protocol&#x2019;s efficacy without sedation or anesthesia in guiding treatment of minimally displaced LHCF.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Twenty children with minimally displaced LHCF seen on emergency department radiographs were prospectively identified. Patients were referred for MRI 5&#x2013;10&#x2009;days after injury. MRIs were performed during daytime hours with an above elbow splint on (Figure 1). No sedation or anesthesia was administered. Flexible coils and 3&#x2009;T scanners were used. The MRI protocol had three sequences: 3D WATS (0,5&#x2009;mm slices), T1 coronal, and STIR coronal (3&#x2009;mm slices). Total scan time was less than 10&#x2009;min. Radiographs and MRIs were evaluated by a consultant orthopedic surgeon and a consultant musculoskeletal radiologist. Fractures were staged according to the Song classification. Outcomes were scan quality, Song classification of radiographs and MRIs, method of treatment and secondary displacement.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Twenty children, 7 girls and 13 boys were included. Mean age was 5.2&#x2009;years (range 2&#x2013;10). MRIs were completed a mean of 6 days after injury. On plain radiographs 12 fractures were evaluated as Song stage I, two as stage II, three as stage III and three as stage IV. MRI showed only bone edema in three cases. Three fractures were stage I, four stage II and eight stage III. Two fractures were stage IV, however, not the same as seen on plain radiographs. No cases of secondary displacement were seen during follow-up.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> MRI was feasible in all cases including two 2-year olds and gave a clear view of the extent of the injury. In 13 (65%) cases, MRI changed the classification. Seventeen (85%) fractures could be safely treated non-operatively. MRI showed that 50% of fractures were unstable. Three cases showed &gt;4&#x2009;mm of displacement and underwent surgery.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Radiographs are sufficient in suspecting LHCF but cannot show the extension and stability of the fracture. When evaluating minimally displaced LHCF with MRI most children can be safely treated without surgery.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Humeral lateral condyle fractures are the second-most common pediatric elbow fractures. These fractures carry a risk of complications among which non-unions are a rare but a major concern. This study investigates risk factors associated with non-union development following surgical correction in a multicenter study and reports a series of successfully treated non-unions.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A multicenter retrospective case series was conducted including pediatric patients who underwent operative treatment for humeral lateral condyle fractures between years 2005 and 2019, and subsequently developed non-unions requiring revision surgery. Non-unions were defined as the absence of callus formation at approximately 8&#x2009;weeks follow-up which required further surgical treatment to achieve healing. Complications such as stiffness and osteonecrosis are recorded. Risk factors for nonunion development were identified. Statistical significance is held at 0.05.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Out of 762 lateral condyle fractures, 15 (2.0%) developed non-unions. The average patient age was 6&#x2009;years, majority (67%) were male, 53% were openly reduced at index procedure, and the majority (80%) underwent K-wire fixation. Cases that later developed into non-unions were initially casted for 7.06&#x2009;weeks (interquartile range (IQR) 3.18&#x2009;weeks). All cases that resulted in non-unions were classified as Song IV (40%) and V (53%), Jacob II (27%) and III (67). Median time to revision surgery was approximately 11&#x2009;weeks (IQR: 4.53&#x2009;weeks) from initial intervention. Revision cases were casted for 4.43&#x2009;weeks (IQR: 2.5&#x2009;weeks), non-unions required 13.5&#x2009;weeks (IQR: 3.83&#x2009;weeks) for complete healing, and open reduction and screw fixation was the most common (80%) approach. All non-unions healed at follow-up, and 2 (13%) experienced range of motion deficits requiring therapy. 1 case of osteonecrosis was observed after the surgery for nonunion. Higher Song (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.04) and Jacob (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.027) classifications were significantly associated with non-unions.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This study highlights the outcomes of nonunion cases following surgical correction of humeral lateral condyle fractures in children. Severe fracture patterns pose a higher risk of cases resulting in non-unions. Revision surgeries via open or closed reduction and screw fixation are highly successful in promoting healing.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> The success in resolving non-unions through revision surgeries, as evidenced in this research, reaffirms the efficacy of surgical management, paving the way for optimized treatment protocols.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Forearm diaphyseal fractures are common injuries in pediatric patients. Operative intervention is indicated based on criteria of angulation, displacement, and rotation. As a child nears skeletal maturity, tolerances narrow considerably. Prevention of malrotation can avoid functional disability in forearm rotation. The purpose of this study is to define radiographic anatomic relationships in forearm fracture malrotation and develop a new, more reliable method for measuring malrotation.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Eighty-six match-paired forearm specimens from 43 cadavers were utilized to perform radiographic analysis. We performed standard AP radiographs of each forearm specimen. Novel measurements were taken including tuberosity length (TL), maximum radial bow (MRB), location of maximum radial bow (LRB), and radial projection (RP). TL ratios and RP ratios to the contralateral forearm were calculated. Once baseline measurements were recorded in all specimens, 10 specimens were randomized to undergo midshaft radius osteotomies, with radiographic analysis of each at 5&#xB0; interval to 90&#xB0; supinated and pronated. Radiographic analysis was repeated on each radiograph in the same manner as the baseline specimens. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) testing was used to analyze for differences between different degrees of rotation. Pairwise comparison studies and Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to determine correlation.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> In a pairwise comparison, there was a statistically significant difference in RP compared to baseline data, but only beyond 35&#xB0; of supination malrotation (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001&#x2013;0.013). On correlation analysis, there was a strong positive correlation at 35&#xB0; of supination to 35&#xB0; of pronation between malrotation angle and RP (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.99), TL (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;&#x2212;.99), and MRB (0.97). From 35&#xB0;&#x2013;90&#xB0; of pronation, there was a strong negative correlation between malrotation angle RP (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;&#x2013;0.99) and MRB (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;&#x2013;0.99), with RP ratio declining steadily with increasing malrotation. TL was not shown to predict malrotation beyond 35&#xB0; of pronation.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Radial tuberosity projection (RP) and length (TL) correlate with malrotation in forearm fractures. RP, if 0 or negative, can be utilized to determine if malrotation in supination exceeds 35&#xB0;. Both TL and RP ratios (compared to contralateral) can be utilized to estimate the degree of pronation malrotation, with peaks at 35 and 45&#xB0;, respectively; beyond this, RP ratio compared to baseline will decline with TL ratio remaining constant.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Utilization of these radiographic parameters as a tool to identify and measure forearm malrotation, provides objective guidance to assist decision-making. These provide guidance on when to intervene surgically for rotational malalignment, especially if angulation and displacement do not meet operative criteria.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Proximal humerus fractures (PHFx) constitute around 2% of all pediatric fractures. While younger children with displaced fractures often undergo non-operative treatments due to their substantial remodeling potential, optimal treatment for adolescents is not well defined. The study aimed to assess outcomes of operative versus non-operative treatment of displaced proximal humerus fractures in adolescents.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> This prospective study assessed adolescents aged 10&#x2013;16&#x2009;years with displaced PHFx from 2018 to 2022 at six level one pediatric trauma centers. Displacement criteria were &gt;50% shaft diameter or angulation &gt;30&#xB0; on AP/lateral shoulder X-rays. Treatment choice (non-operative vs operative) was decided by the treating physician. Radiographic data and clinical data (patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and shoulder range of motion) were collected during follow-up visits at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months. PROs included: PROMIS Depression, Physical Activity, Anxiety, Pain Interference, Upper Extremity; Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI); and QuickDASH questionnaires. Patients were further grouped into a severe displacement cohort, defined as angulation &gt;40&#xB0; or displacement &gt;75% of shaft diameter on AP or lateral X-rays. Clinical and radiographic data were compared between the two treatment cohorts.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Out of 78 enrolled patients, 36 (46%) underwent operative treatment. Patients treated operatively were notably older (13.5 vs 12.2&#x2009;years, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) and exhibited greater mean angulation on AP shoulder view at presentation (31.1&#xB0; vs 23.5&#xB0;, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). For the entire cohort, all PROs improved over time. At 6 weeks, operative patients demonstrated superior PROMIS upper extremity scores based on minimally clinical important difference (MCID) (46.4 vs 34.3, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.027); however, this distinction disappeared by three months. In a sub analysis of 35 patients with severe displacement 21 (60.1%) underwent surgical intervention. No metrics showed significant differences between treatment modalities, with all PROs achieving population norm values by 3&#x2009;months. ROM metrics showed non-superiority between operative and non-operative treatments irrespective of fracture displacement.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> We found no differences in PROs and ROM between operative and non-operative treatments of PHFx. If not contraindicated, non-operative treatment is recommended for displaced pediatric proximal humerus fractures irrespective of fracture displacement.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Non-operative treatment reduces healthcare costs and risks associated with surgery and is recommended for displaced pediatric proximal humerus fractures if not contraindicated.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Supracondylar humerus (SCH) fractures are the most common type of elbow fracture in children, with high rates of surgical intervention. Medical management for postoperative pain for SCH fractures has high variability, with evidence that many SCH fractures could be treated effectively postoperatively with minimal or no opioids. Furthermore, there is significant morbidity and mortality related to pediatric opioid consumption. The goal of this study was to characterize the prescription patterns in the United States following closed reduction and percutaneous pinning (CRPP) of SCH and to propose a reduced post-operative pain protocol.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> All patients, aged&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;17&#x2009;years of age, who underwent CRPP of SCH from January 2010 and December 2021 were identified in the PearlDiver Mariner Claims Database. The primary outcome was quantifying postoperative pain medication prescriptions in the 30&#x2009;days following SCH CRPP. Patient demographics, prescription duration, and morphine milligram equivalents (MME) were analyzed.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> In total, 45,252 SCH CRPP cases were identified, with average age of 5.7&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;2.4&#x2009;years. Nearly half of all patients (22,246/45,252) received a narcotic pain prescription throughout the study. Patients were prescribed a mean of 6.0&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;2.0&#x2009;days of narcotics, averaging 16 MMEs per day, with an average total of 79.2 MME prescribed. The most common prescriptions were Acetaminophen/Codeine 120&#x2013;12&#x2009;mg/5&#x2009;mL and Hydrocodone/Acetaminophen 7.5&#x2013;325&#x2009;mg/15&#x2009;mL (6290 and 8389 prescriptions, respectively). Non-narcotic medications, including acetaminophen and non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, were prescribed to less than 10% of patients (4120/45,252). The rate of opioid prescription per patient has decreased throughout the study period, with 56.2% being prescribed an opioid in 2010, and 27.8% of patients being prescribed an opioid in 2021 following CRPP of SCH fracture.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Nearly half of all patients over the past decade treated with CRPP for SCH received an average of three times (79.2 MME) the largest recommended narcotic prescription amount. However, the percentage of patients being prescribed an opioid following CRPP of an SCH fracture is decreasing.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> While efforts have been made to reduce opioid overprescribing while maintaining appropriate analgesia for SCH fractures, there continues to be room for improvement. The authors advocate providing local analgesia infiltration intra-operatively, prescriptions for both an NSAID and acetaminophen, and education by the surgeon on scheduling non-narcotic pain medications, rest, ice, and elevation.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Fractures in skeletally immature populations pose unique challenges in treatment. Metal-alloy fixation devices have been commonly used for internal fixation; however, their removal is often required to prevent future complications, necessitating a second surgery. New bio-integrative fixation devices may present an alternative to metal-alloy fixation devices through minimizing device-related complications and eliminating the need for a second surgery. The study aims to compare post-operative outcomes between bio-integrative fixation devices and metal-alloy fixation devices for treating skeletally immature ankle fractures.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> The study is a retrospective, descriptive, single-center, IRB approved study, which enrolled 35 participants who underwent internal fixation for skeletally immature ankle fractures. Twelve patients received bio-integrative devices, while 23 received metal-alloy devices. Patients were followed up for up to 52&#x2009;weeks post-procedure, and data analysis included visit details, radiographic studies, and treatment courses. Radiographs were assessed based on image quality, implant visibility, bony reactions, hardware failure, and fusion rates. Device-related complications were analyzed using the Clavien&#x2013;Dindo classification system. Device removal rates, surgical interventions, cost-efficiency, and quality of life outcomes were measured using statistical medical record and billing analysis techniques.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Fracture healing, post-procedure, was insignificantly different between the two patient populations. Metal screws exhibited significantly higher complications rates as well as significantly increased surgical intervention rates. Actual procedure costs between the two patient populations were insignificantly different. This is related to the relatively low incidence of complications in pediatric ankle fracture fixation, producing a low re-operation rate. However, when patients required a removal of hardware procedure, actual procedure costs for patients averaged approximately $3030 higher. Patients had statistically insignificant differences in quality of life for the initial operations and improved quality of life after complication rates and hardware removal re-operations are factored in.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Bio-integrative fixation devices are comparable to metal-alloy devices in treating transitional ankle fractures, while offering advantages in terms of complication rates, re-operation rates, cost-efficiency for patients, and quality of life. A larger, multi-center, prospective, extended study is warranted to establish a more comprehensive understanding of the long-term efficacy and safety of bio-integrative devices in this specific population.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Pediatric patients with ankle fractures often require re-operation to remove metal-alloy fixation devices, which increases complications and burdens on patients. Therefore, bio-integrative implants may present a viable solution to these issues by potentially eliminating the need for re-operation, improving patient outcomes, reducing healthcare costs, and enhancing the overall quality of life for these young patients and their families.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> The incidence of gunshot wound (GSW)-induced fractures among pediatric populations is witnessing an upward trend. Considering this, it becomes imperative for medical practitioners to be well-versed with the concomitant conditions that might arise from such traumatic events. In this study, we aim to elucidate the psychiatric disorders that pediatric patients are more susceptible to develop following a fracture caused by a gunshot wound.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> We identified a large, representative sample of pediatric patients that sustained a fracture between 1 January 2003 and 31 December 2022. Patients were then sorted by whether or not their fracture was sustained due to a GSW, and demographic information including gender, racial identity, and BMI were collected. We additionally collected the presence of pre-existing psychiatric diagnoses including anxiety, mood disorders, attention-deficit disorders, and conduct disorder. Patients were then matched by demographic variables and psychiatric diagnoses. Patients were followed for 5&#x2009;years to identify the risk for the development of various psychiatric conditions.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> After matching, 5589 patients were included in each cohort with a mean age of 15.2-years old in both groups, and no significant difference in the rates of pre-fracture psychiatric conditions. When comparing patients with a GSW fracture to those with a non-GSW fracture, there was a risk ratio of 6.17 (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001) to develop an opioid-related disorder, a risk ratio of 4.50 to develop a sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic-related disorder, a risk ratio of 4.09 (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001) to develop a stimulant-related disorder, a risk ratio of 3.28 (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001) to develop a cannabis-related disorder, a risk ratio of 2.87 (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001) to develop a nicotine dependence, a risk ratio of 2.41 (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.002) to develop a cocaine-related disorder, and a risk ratio of 1.96 (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001) to develop an alcohol-related disorder. In addition, we found that there was a 2.59 times greater risk of developing generalized anxiety disorders (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001), a 2.03 times greater risk of developing insomnia (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001), and a 1.60 times greater risk of developing depression (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our study found that patients sustaining a GSW-related fracture are at greater risk of developing drug use disorders and anxiety, depression, and insomnia than patients who sustained non-GSW-related fractures.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> It is critical that physicians are aware of this relationship to ensure that patients sustaining GSW-related fractures receive the additional treatment that they need to prevent the development of additional psychiatric conditions.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Pediatric talar fractures are exceedingly rare but are known to have significant complications. Infection, non-union, avascular necrosis (AVN), post-traumatic arthritis (PTA), and the need for removal of hardware (RHW) are known complications. Limited literature exists on pediatric talar fractures. This study aims to report on the most extensive collection of surgically treated pediatric talar fractures and associated complication rates over a 20-year period.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> This study is a retrospective analysis of operatively treated talar fractures in children. Talar neck (TN) fractures were classified by Hawkins criteria, and talar body (TB) fractures were classified by Sneppen classification. Electronic medical records were reviewed for demographic information, surgery notes, clinical follow-up, infection (deep or superficial), non-union, AVN, PTA, and RHW. Superficial infection was defined as a patient requiring oral antibiotics for wound complication or documented wound infection. Deep infection was defined as infection present on imaging or need for surgical debridement. AVN, PTA, and RHW were defined based on imaging and clinical documentation. Descriptive statistics were utilized to depict patient characteristics and complications.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> There were 47 patients in our study (22 male, 25 female). Average age of the population was 15.79 (&#xB1;2.92)&#x2009;years. There were 27 TN fractures, 14 TB fractures, and 6 combined TN and body fractures. Hawkins type 2 fractures were the most common TN fracture (14). Sneppen type B fractures were the most common type of TB fracture (8). Average follow-up in the sample was 7.70 (&#xB1;7.71)&#x2009;months. High-energy mechanisms in all patients, such as car accidents or sports injuries, caused fractures. There was no infection (superficial or deep) or nonunion, even though 23% were open fractures. Open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) was used to treat 96% of the TN fractures. One TN fracture patient had PTA, 7 had RHW, none had AVN. ORIF was used to treat 93% of the isolated TB fractures. One TB patient had PTA, three had RHW, and none had AVN. All combined TN and body fractures were treated with ORIF. There was one patient with PTA, three with RHW, and one with AVN with no concurrent complications.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Pediatric talar fractures are rare but serious. Surgery can reduce complications, but caution is needed in treatment. Our study had lower complication rates than previous reports.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This study is the most extensive collection of surgically treated talar fractures detailing imperative complication rates associated with the injury.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Conservative management of most pediatric clavicle fractures is standard of care. However, treatment durations, activity restrictions, and timing of radiographs vary among physicians. Data with which to create protocols based on typical radiographic findings throughout healing are not available. This study aims to establish when clinically relevant radiographic changes can be anticipated and after what time period radiographs are unnecessary.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Patients&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;18&#x2009;years old with a nonoperative acute diaphyseal clavicle fracture treated until clinical union (&#x2265;3 bridged cortices and nontender) between January 2018 and July 2023 by a large academic multispecialty orthopedic practice were retrospectively reviewed. Variable treatment protocols by 37 different physicians representing 6 orthopedic subspecialties provided a large sample of radiographs throughout and after healing. Exclusion criteria included insufficient radiographs, documentation, and/or follow-up. Radiographic healing was assessed on orthogonal X-rays by determining the number of bridged cortices and the modified radiographic union score for tibial fractures (mRUST). After preliminary analysis identified age-associated skew, patients were analyzed as infants/toddlers (0&#x2013;2&#x2009;years old), school-aged children (3&#x2013;9&#x2009;years old), and adolescents (10&#x2013;18&#x2009;years old). Radiographic variables were analyzed within assigned time intervals between 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and &gt;20&#x2009;weeks.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Among 390 patients, 304 nonoperatively healed fractures met inclusion criteria. Average shortening and displacement were 0.3&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;0.6 cm and 42.6%&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;43.0%, respectively. Follow-up averaged 53.3&#x2009;days with an orthopedic physician and 503.2&#x2009;days for a well-child check. On average, patients were nontender during their outpatient visit 36.6&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;17.6&#x2009;days after injury. Age-specific findings are summarized in Table 1.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Assuming a routine nonoperative course, radiographic parameters demonstrate significant changes until 4&#x2009;weeks in infants/toddlers, 8&#x2009;weeks in school-aged children, and 12&#x2009;weeks in adolescents, after which repeat imaging is of questionable benefit. Radiographic union is typically visible by 4&#x2009;weeks in younger children (&lt;10&#x2009;years old) and 8&#x2009;weeks in adolescents (&#x2265;10&#x2009;years old).</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> These data can help physicians standardize X-ray requirements during outpatient follow-up of pediatric clavicle fractures and eliminate unnecessary radiographs after &#x2265;3 cortices are bridged (typically 4&#x2009;weeks in infants/toddlers, 8&#x2009;weeks in school-aged children, and 12&#x2009;weeks in adolescents).</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> There is growing evidence that polymer-based resorbable implants can be used effectively for various pediatric osteosyntheses. While older generation materials caused many adverse tissue reactions, newer products no longer cause similar effects. In our retrospective study, we present our experience with implants made of poly-L-glycolic acid copolymer material (PLGA) after various osteosyntheses performed on 495 children.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> We retrospectively reviewed the data of patients who underwent osteosynthesis with a PLGA-based polymer implant between 2010 and 2022. Inclusion criteria were age under 16&#x2009;years, at least 1&#x2009;year of follow-up, and a bone fracture that was synthesized with biodegradable PLGA screws or pins. We examined the number of major and minor complications, the possible need for repeated intervention, possible adverse tissue reactions, and the rate of surgical conversions to metal alloys.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 495 patients met the criteria. The distribution of fractures was as follows: elbow fractures 29% (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;144), knee fractures 26% (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;128), ankle fractures 19% (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;94), distal forearm fractures 19% (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;94), and other fractures 7% (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;35). (The implants were completely absorbed by the bone after 4&#x2009;years at the latest, and no bone cyst formation was observed). Repeated intervention was necessary in 2.62% (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;13) patients. The reasons for this were as follows: mispositioned implant (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;4), implant fracture (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;2), secondary displacement (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;3), refracture (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;2), skin irritation (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;2). Temporary superficial soft tissue irritation was observed in 6 patients. Deep septic complications were not detected in any case.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The detected complications were not related to the implant material and their number does not exceed the proportion of problems reported in the international literature for the use of traditional implants. Based on our experience, the use of absorbable implants is a good alternative to traditional metal alloys during the osteosynthesis of certain pediatric bone fractures. In the future, further prospective comparative studies are needed to confirm the favorable results.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> No implant removal surgery is necessary, which can reduce the rate of repeated hospitalizations and further complications.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Transitional ankle fractures in the pediatric patients are commonly diagnosed with plain radiographs. In these injuries advanced imaging with computer tomography (CT) scans are often used to determine fracture pattern and displacement, and ultimately guide indications for management. The purpose of this study was to assess the ability of radiographic measures to predict displacement on CT for transitional ankle fractures.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> This study is a retrospective review of pediatric patients who presented with Salter-Harris III (Tillaux) and IV (triplane) fractures at a single institution over a 7-year period between October 2015 and November 2022. We included all patients aged 18 and younger who had both plain radiographs and CT imaging at the time of presentation. We excluded patients with ipsilateral lower extremity fracture. Radiograph and CT measurements were performed by three independent evaluators, and interclass correlations were calculated to measure interobserver agreement. Unpaired t-tests and Spearman correlations were utilized for statistical analysis.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> This study included 61 patients. The average age of patients was 12.3% and 66% of patients were male. Most injuries were associated with a fall (69%), followed by sports (28%). Approximately 59% of patients were treated operatively, and these patients had greater articular displacement on radiographs than patients treated nonoperatively (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05) (Table 1). Operative patients had an average of 3.2&#x2009;mm of displacement on CT. Most measurements showed substantial interobserver agreement (ICC&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.5). Patients with &#x2265;2&#x2009;mm of displacement or diastasis on CT had significantly great articular displacement on mortise view compared to patients with &lt;2&#x2009;mm (1.14&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1.01 vs 0.66&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;0.69, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.04). There was significant correlation between CT displacement and the following measures on radiographs: tibiofibular clear space on the mortise view (&#x3C1;&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.26, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.04), articular displacement on the lateral view (&#x3C1;&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.28, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.03), and articular displacement on the mortise view (&#x3C1;&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.35, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> There are several radiographic parameters that correlate with increased displacement of transitional ankle fractures on CT. Specifically, increased articular displacement on mortise view and lateral view, as well as increased tibiofibular clear space on the mortise view correlate with increased displacement. Articular displacement on the mortise view is predictive of displacement on CT and may be a good indicator for the selective use of CT scans in patients with this injury.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> CT scans should be obtained in patients with transitional ankle fractures that have increased displacement on the mortise or lateral view and increased tibiofibular clear space on the mortise view.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Inferior pole patellar sleeve fractures (PSFs) are an uncommon pediatric injury. Despite representing over half of all pediatric patella fractures, existing literature on PSFs is limited to case reports and small case series. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the radiographic and clinical characteristics of operatively treated PSFs as well as outcomes following surgical management.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective case series of all inferior pole PSFs requiring surgery from 2006 to 2023 was performed at a single urban tertiary care children&#x2019;s hospital. Cases were identified using diagnostic and billing codes. Patient demographics and injury characteristics were recorded. Radiographic fracture displacement, Epiphyseal Fusion Stage to assess skeletal age (O&#x2019;Connor et al. 2008), and postoperative patellar height (Caton&#x2013;Deschamps Index) were assessed. Surgical techniques and postoperative rehabilitation practices were recorded. Postoperative complications were categorized using the Clavien&#x2013;Dindo&#x2013;Sink Classification System (CDS).</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Thirty-eight inferior pole PSFs were identified meeting study criteria. Most patients were male (86.8%) with a mean age of 11.03&#x2009;years old (range:7.15&#x2013;15.0) and a normal mean BMI. Radiographically, most patients were Epiphyseal Fusion Stage 0 (non-union). Injuries were sustained most from falls from scooters (18%) and playing/falling during basketball (16%). Median fracture displacement was 12.0 (IQR: 5.5&#x2013;20.8)&#x2009;mm. These fractures were predominantly treated with suture-based fixation (84%) with a mean post-reduction CDI of 1.18 (SD: 0.19). Postoperative immobilization varied within the cohort, and the initiation of knee ROM was permitted at a mean of 3.47 (SD: 1.94)&#x2009;weeks. All patients regained baseline range of motion and quadriceps strength and return to sport was achieved by a median of 18.3 (IQR: 12.6&#x2013;31.3)&#x2009;weeks. Complications occurred in 10 (26.4%) patients, but only 4 (10.5%) were CDS Grade III (requiring a return to the OR). Subsequent surgeries included excision of symptomatic heterotopic ossification, partial patellectomy for fracture nonunion and arthrofibrosis, arthroscopic lysis of adhesions for contracture, and chondroplasty for a patellar chondral injury.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Inferior pole PSFs appear to occur most commonly among pre-pubertal males of normal BMI and high-normal range patellar height. Despite variable rehabilitation protocols, operative management resulted in restoration of extensor mechanism function. Return to sport was achieved at a median of 4.5&#x2009;months. About 10.5% of patients experienced complications requiring unplanned surgery.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This large series of a rare pediatric fracture improves our understanding of the epidemiology of this injury. Surgical management frequently restores knee function and return to sport, but the need for subsequent surgical management is not an insignificant risk.</p>

        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Fractures are a common presentation of non-accidental trauma (NAT) in the pediatric population. While there has been increased awareness of the risk factors and presentations of pediatric NAT, presentation could be subtle, and a high degree of suspicion is needed not to miss NAT. The purpose of this study was to examine the distribution of fractures and the demographic characteristics of the affected patients. In addition, considering the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent worldwide quarantine; This study aimed to deepen our understanding of the demographic factors and fracture types associated with NAT, enabling clinicians to better identify these cases.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> We used the US Collaborative Network in the TriNetX Research Network, which is the largest database of deidentified electronic medical records from 55 healthcare organizations. TriNetX was queried for all visits in children under the age of 6&#x2009;years from 2015 to 2022, resulting in a cohort of over 32 million records, of which all accidental and non-accidental fractures were extracted and analyzed to determine the incidence, fracture location, and demographics of NAT. Statistical analysis was done on a combination of Python version 3.11.3 for Windows and Epipy and zEpid packages used under MIT licensure for certain graphical representations.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Overall, 0.36% of all pediatric patients had a diagnosis of NAT, and 4.93% of fractures (34,038 out of 689,740 total fractures) were determined to be non-accidental. Skull and face fractures constituted 17.9% of all NAT fractures, but rib/sternum fractures had an OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;6.7 for NAT. Children with intellectual disability (ID) or autism spectrum disorder (ASD) had a nine times higher risk for non-accidental fractures. The number of non-accidental fractures significantly increased after 2019, along with a 60% increase in the number of children with ID or ASD in this subgroup, and a stronger association between rib/sternum fractures and NAT.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The findings of this study suggest that nearly 1 out of all 20 fractures in children under age 6 are caused by NAT, and rib/sternum fractures are most predictive of an inflicted nature. We also found disturbing changes during and after the COVID-19 pandemic that had a significant impact on the incidence and patterns of inflicted fractures, increasing the rate of NAT across all pediatric patients, increasing the prevalence of rib/sternum fractures, and increasing the number of children with ID among children with NAT related fractures.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Findings suggest an increasing trend in NAT fractures.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Certain types of supracondylar humerus (SHF) fractures present with a fracture morphology that differs significantly from the regular transverse type. These &#x201C;atypical&#x201D; fracture patterns can complicate reduction and fixation attempts and can result in early loss of reduction. Certain pin configurations have been proposed for specific fracture patterns to increase stability. We performed a retrospective study to identify the prevalence of certain fracture subtypes and evaluate the effect of fracture patterns on the need for open reduction.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> The study was conducted retrospectively. The medical records and radiographs of 194 children with Gartland type III-IV or flexion-type SHFs were evaluated for fracture morphology and the need for open fracture. Fracture line obliquity, the presence of medial spikes, neurological status, vascular status, and preoperative&#x2013;postoperative reduction quality were recorded for all participants. Ethics committee approval was obtained for the study, and informed consent was obtained from all patients included in the study. In the statistical analysis, the intergroup comparison was performed with the Mann&#x2013;Whitney U-test. P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05 was accepted as the significance level.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> The participants&#x2019; mean age was 7.75 (2&#x2013;14) years. Fractures with medial comminution (100%) and flexion-type SHFs (40%) had the highest rate of open reduction. Although failure to achieve acceptable reduction by closed means was lowest in the flexion and medial comminution type factures, there was no interposition of the neurovascular bundle in the fracture lines. The open reduction rate for transverse fractures was 6.21%, and the open reduction rate for non-transverse fractures was 9.09%. When the fractures were grouped according to being transverse or non-transverse (atypical), there was no difference between the two groups in terms of the need for open reduction (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.548).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Flexion type and medial comminuted extension type fractures are difficult to reduce by closed means and are more likely to require open reduction.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> In our study, controversial issues in SCH fractures, one of the most common pathologies in pediatric orthopedics, were examined with a very high number of patients.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Pediatric proximal humerus fractures (PHFx) are uncommon and make up approximately 2% of all pediatric fractures. Traditionally, most cases are treated non-operatively with closed reduction (CR) or immobilization with no reduction (INR) with excellent outcomes. Indications for CR without fixation remain unclear as immobilization in the position of reduction (shoulder abduction and external rotation) is not practical. We aim to determine the need for CR among adolescents with displaced proximal humerus fracture treated non-operatively.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> We conducted an Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved prospective multicenter study involving 42 adolescents aged 10&#x2013;16&#x2009;years, treated for a displaced PHFx across six institutions between 2018 and 2022. CR was performed under conscious sedation in the emergency department, with data collected during follow-up visits at 6&#x2009;weeks and 3&#x2009;months. Radiographic measurements, range of motion (ROM), and patient-reported outcomes including PROMIS Upper Extremity and Physical Function, SPADI, and QuickDash scores were compared between the INR and CR groups.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Among 42 fractures, 23 (55%) were treated with INR and 19 (45%) with CR followed by placement in hanging arm cast or sling. Around 62% of cases were high-energy injuries. Radiographic alignment and ROM were similar between groups at preoperative, 6&#x2009;weeks, and 3&#x2009;months with no significant differences noted. PROMIS Upper Extremity, Physical Function, QuickDash, and SPADI scores at 6&#x2009;weeks and 3&#x2009;months showed no significant differences between cohorts. Significant improvement was observed between 6&#x2009;weeks and 3&#x2009;months for every PRO in both cohorts.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> For displaced proximal humerus fractures treated nonoperatively, our data suggest INR has a similar radiographic and clinical outcome when compared to closed reduction.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> The results of this study suggest that closed reduction may not be necessary in adolescents with displaced proximal humerus fracture treated non-operatively.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Trampolines are popular leisure activity among children and adolescents. With the growing popularity comes the growing number of trampoline-related injuries. In Finland, there is no general age limit recommendation for the use of trampoline; however, AAOS recommends that children under the age of 6 should not be allowed to use trampolines. The aim of our study was to compare whether the trampoline-related fractures differ between the age groups 0&#x2013;5&#x2009;years and 6&#x2013;16&#x2009;years by using data from a population-based cohort.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> The study population comprises all pediatric trampoline-related fractures treated in the New Children&#x2019;s Hospital, Helsinki, Finland, during 2014&#x2013;2022. The study population was extracted from the institutional fracture database, the Kids&#x2019; Fracture Tool, that included a total of 18,279 fractures at the end of 2022. The fractures were analyzed in two age groups: 0&#x2013;5&#x2009;years and 6&#x2013;16&#x2009;years. The latter age group was larger and therefore the fracture numbers were normalized by age years to compare the groups. The age groups were compared by fractured site.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> The total number of single bone fractures related to trampoline use was 1063 (544 girls, 519 boys). The median age at fracture was 9&#x2009;years. The younger age group consisted of 244 fractures and the older years 819 fractures. The normalized fracture rates per age year were 40.7 fractures/age year (0&#x2013;5&#x2009;years) and 74.5 fractures/age year (6&#x2013;16&#x2009;years). Humerus fractures were observed at later age in girls than boys (mean age 8.9 vs 7.6, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001). Antebrachium fractures were more common in the older age group (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;22 vs N&#x2009;=&#x2009;183) and tibia fractures were more common in the younger age group (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;133 vs N&#x2009;=&#x2009;107). There was no difference in femur fractures between age groups when the normalized fracture rates were considered (1.5/age year vs 1.3/age year). Refer to Figure 1. Surgery was required by 251 (23.6%. Boys N&#x2009;=&#x2009;120, girls&#x2009;=&#x2009;131) individuals. The most often operated fracture was humerus (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;99), the second antebrachium (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;63), the third tibia (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;32). Of the femur fractures nine needed an operation. Surgery was needed more often in older cohort than in the younger cohort (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;228 vs N&#x2009;=&#x2009;23).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> According to our data, only the tibia fractures were more frequently observed in children under the age of six. The fractures of the older children required operative treatment more often than those of the younger.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> These data indicate that younger age does not relate to more severe trampoline-related injuries.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Inversion ankle injuries are among the most common injuries in pediatric sports. In the setting of normal radiographs, these are often diagnosed as ankle sprains.<sup>1</sup> Much research has been done in the adult population on these common injuries, while there is limited research among pediatric specific inversion ankle injuries such as radiographically negative osteochondral epiphyseal fractures, cartilaginous epiphyseal fractures, and periosteal sleeve avulsion fractures.<sup>2</sup></p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Data were extracted from an IRB approved prospective lateral ankle ultrasound study from a single, academic pediatric sports and orthopedic clinic. Patients ages 5&#x2013;12&#x2009;years old at time of enrollment with a diagnosis of first-time lateral ankle inversion injury presenting&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;30&#x2009;days of injury were included. Demographics, physical exam findings, and radiographs were obtained. Ultrasound imaging was obtained by a single fellowship-trained, ultrasound-certified provider, who was blinded to the radiographs. Groups were categorized into avulsion and non-avulsion groups. Comparison analyses included Fisher&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x2122;s exact test, Cohen&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x2122;s Kappa test, Mann&#x2013;Whitney test, and chi-square.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 47 patients (68.1% female) with a mean age of 10.4 &#xC2;&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1.91&#x2009;years presented with a first-time lateral ankle inversion injury. Only two patients (4%) had radiographic diagnosis of avulsion fracture. In the 45 patients with negative X-rays, an additional 9 (20%) had a non-radiographically apparent avulsion identified by ultrasound. Of all avulsions, seven were osteochondral epiphyseal avulsions, two were pure chondral avulsions, and two were periosteal sleeve avulsions. Based upon Cohen&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x2122;s Kappa ratings, there is a difference between radiographic and ultrasound diagnoses. (&#xCE;&#xBA;&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.254, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.009). The avulsion injury group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;11) and the non-avulsion group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;36) exhibited no significant differences in days to presentation, presence of bruising or swelling, and Beighton score. However, there was a significant difference in age between the avulsion versus non-avulsion group (10.9 vs 9.1&#x2009;years; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.007).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Avulsion injuries following pediatric lateral ankle inversion may be underdiagnosed&#x2014;occurring in 20% of patients with normal radiographs, but clearly diagnosed by ultrasound. Symptomatic ankle instability may often present in late childhood and adolescence with a chronic lateral malleolar avulsion fragment present, which may represent an earlier radiographically negative avulsion. Musculoskeletal ultrasound is a quick and accessible modality to identify lateral ankle avulsive injuries acutely and can facilitate new avenues of research on the utility of early recognition and optimal treatment strategies for these higher-grade pediatric lateral ankle injuries.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> These results provide fundamental knowledge on diagnosing acute lateral ankle avulsive injuries.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Pediatric fracture reductions under procedural sedation in the emergency department (ED) are a well-accepted practice. Family-centered care has become a focus of pediatric medicine. Although family member presence during many procedures has been investigated and supported, the impact of family member presence during sedated fracture reductions remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to assess family member, emergency medicine physician, and orthopedic surgery resident experience of sedated fracture reductions based on family member presence during the procedure.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective survey study of family members, orthopedic surgery residents, and emergency medicine physicians for pediatric patients who sustained a distal radius or forearm shaft fracture requiring closed reduction under procedural sedation in the ED between October 2021 and July 2022. Family members who remained in the room during fracture reduction were compared to those who left the room. The primary outcome was family member satisfaction with patient care during the fracture reduction. Several secondary outcomes regarding family member and physician experiences and perceptions were also evaluated.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 297 eligible patients were identified. Around 40.4% of family members, 49.5% of emergency medicine (EM) physicians, and 58.6% of orthopedic surgery residents responded to the survey. The majority (55%, 66/120) of family members indicated an initial preference to remain with their child during the fracture reduction. Ultimately, 51.7% (62/120) of family members remained in the room and 48.3% (58/120) left. Family members who were in accordance with their initial preference had a significantly more positive experience (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.017). Orthopedic surgery residents felt more negatively about family member presence than EM physicians (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), and the negative feeling related to resident post-graduate year. EM physicians believed family member presence had a positive impact on the family member (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.013) and child (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) without affect them (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.679), while orthopedic surgery residents felt family member presence had a negative impact on the family member (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.003) and themselves (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). The attitude of EM physicians toward family member presence had an impact on family member location, while orthopedic surgery resident attitude did not (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our study demonstrates that family members who are in accordance with their preference during sedated fracture reductions in the ED are more satisfied with their experience. Furthermore, we highlight differences between EM physician and orthopedic surgeon experience and the impact this has on family member presence.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> Novel insight into family member presence during sedated pediatric fracture reductions which can help to guide an educated, family-centered clinical environment.</p>

</p>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Gartland type 1 supracondylar humerus (SCH) fractures are a common pediatric injury that can be treated with casting. Previous studies have questioned the utility of follow-up radiographs for type 2 and 3 supracondylar fractures treated operatively. Due to this, we hypothesize that follow-up radiographs for type 1 SCH fractures will result in no change in management and represent significant additional cost.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> We performed a retrospective review of 101 consecutive type 1 SCH fractures at our institution. All had been treated nonoperatively. The medical records and imaging archive were reviewed for demographic and clinical information, as well as imaging findings. The number of images obtained after confirmation of the injury were totaled. Change in management at the 3-week follow-up was defined as maintaining long arm casting after that visit. The cost of the x-ray was determined by the fixed cost at our institution.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 101 consecutive patients were included in this study (56 male, 45 female). A type I SCH fracture was confirmed on initial presentation in 95/101 patients. Seventy-nine patients returned for follow-up at an average of 9.5 (&#xB1;4.5) days. Four x-rays were necessary to confirm the injury while 75 unnecessary films were obtained. The &#x201C;3&#x2009;week follow-up&#x201D; occurred at an average of 22.9 (&#xB1;6.2) days and all patients received x-rays. Casting was discontinued at that time in all patients, representing a 0% change in management. At our institution, the standard cost of an AP and lateral elbow x-ray is $392.23 with a reading fee of $37.00. The total cost of all unnecessary radiographs (176) was $69,964.49.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In the current series of 101 consecutive patients with type I SCH fractures 95 had confirmation of their injury on the first presentation while 6 required a follow-up x-ray for confirmation. There was no change in management at either the subsequent clinic visit or at the 3-week follow-up. Furthermore, there were no instances of complications associated with any of the patients because of their treatment. One-hundred and seventy-six superfluous x-rays resulted in an excess cost of $69,964.49.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> This study suggests that follow-up radiographs for patients with confirmed type 1 SCH fractures are unnecessary. Incorporation of this into standard practice will save patient caregivers and the health system time and money while also decreasing unnecessary radiation to patients.</p>

        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Patients&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;18&#x2009;years-old with an acute diaphyseal clavicle fracture treated between January 2018 and July 2023 by a large academic multispecialty orthopedic practice (in an inclusive regional health network) were retrospectively reviewed. The study involved 26 orthopedic surgeons (including 3 pediatric, 8 sports medicine, 6 general) and 11 nonoperative sports medicine physicians, all of which treated patients ranging 0&#x2013;18&#x2009;years old. Exclusion criteria included insufficient radiographs, documentation, and/or follow-up. Demographic, radiographic, and outpatient treatment parameters were recorded. Age groups were separated into &lt;10 and &#x2265;10&#x2009;years old to control for age-associated differences and to ensure findings are comparable to recent literature from the Function after Adolescent Clavicle Trauma and Surgery (FACTS) database.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Among 560 pediatric clavicle fractures, 390 met inclusion criteria (44.1% of which were treated by a pediatric orthopedic surgeon). Follow-up averaged 54.6&#x2009;days until orthopedic discharge and 502.7&#x2009;days until the most recent well-child visit (83% had a well-child visit after orthopedic discharge). Overall, pediatric orthopedic patients were slightly younger (8.4&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;5.3 versus 11.1&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;4.6&#x2009;years; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Shortening, displacement, and operative rates did not differ between pediatric versus non-pediatric cohorts. Even after excluding the only case of nonunion, pediatric orthopedic surgeons trialed nonoperative management longer than non-pediatric specialties (22.3 versus 7.3&#x2009;days, OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.7, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.005). Among 361 nonoperative patients, pediatric orthopedists required less outpatient visits (2.5 versus 2.9, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), shorter follow-up duration (38.8 versus 54.5&#x2009;days, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), less X-ray orders (2.4 versus 2.9, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), and fewer total X-ray views (4.9 versus 6.1, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). In adolescents, pediatric orthopedists ordered less total X-ray views (5.9 vs 6.7, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.015) but other outpatient parameters were equivalent.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Young patients (&lt;10&#x2009;years old) with clavicle fractures treated by a pediatric orthopedic surgeon have shorter treatment durations with less radiation compared to those treated by non-pediatric orthopedists. These differences become less apparent in adolescents. However, non-pediatric specialists are almost 3&#xD7; more likely to perform early surgery (within 2&#x2009;weeks) than pediatric orthopedic surgeons.</p>
        <p><bold>Significance:</bold> When treating pediatric clavicle fractures, pediatric orthopedic surgeons are more clinically efficient with younger children and more likely to trial nonoperative management before surgery in adolescents.</p>
