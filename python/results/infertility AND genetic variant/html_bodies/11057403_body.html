<p><sans-serif>In mammals, ejaculated sperm migrate toward the fertilizing site along the female reproductive tract. They sense environmental factors to acquire the fertilizing ability during their journey to the eggs in a process termed capacitation (</sans-serif>Austin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">1951</xref><sans-serif>;</sans-serif> Chang <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0019">1951</xref><sans-serif>). Capacitated sperm develop a unique motility pattern called hyperactivated motility, which is characterized by the asymmetric beating of their flagella with increased amplitude</sans-serif> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>; Suarez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0090">1993</xref><sans-serif>;</sans-serif> Yanagimachi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0101">1969</xref><sans-serif>)</sans-serif>. This hyperactivated motility enables sperm to pass through a luminal structure filled with a viscous fluid such as the utero-tubal junction (UTJ) to successfully reach the fertilizing site, the ampulla (Chung et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0023">2014</xref><sans-serif>;</sans-serif> DeMott et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0026">1995</xref><sans-serif>)</sans-serif>. In addition, sperm hyperactivation is crucial to penetrate the glycoprotein barrier of eggs, the zona pellucida, for successful fertilization (Ren et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0079">2001</xref><sans-serif>;</sans-serif> Stauss et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0088">1995</xref><sans-serif>)</sans-serif>. Therefore, defective hyperactivated motility impairs male fertility in mammals.

<p><sans-serif>Environmental factors in the female reproductive tract trigger Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling pathways in sperm to develop hyperactivated motility. Albumin in the female reproductive tract causes cholesterol efflux from the sperm membrane (</sans-serif>Aitken and Nixon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0002">2013</xref><sans-serif>), which enhances sperm capacitation by altering membrane fluidity and making membrane proteins ready to function. In addition, high levels of bicarbonate and increasing pH condition toward the fertilizing site alkalinize sperm intracellular pH (pH<sub>i</sub>) in the female reproductive tract (</sans-serif>Lishko et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0053">2012</xref><sans-serif>;</sans-serif> Vyklicka and Lishko <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0094">2020</xref><sans-serif>). These upstream events coordinate the introduction of Ca<sup>2+</sup> into sperm cells via the sperm-specific Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel, CATSPER, during sperm capacitation (</sans-serif>Hwang and Chung <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0043">2023</xref><sans-serif>). Simultaneously, PMCA4, a Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase pump that extrudes intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> from sperm, is crucial for normal and hyperactivated sperm motility (</sans-serif>Withers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0099">2006</xref><sans-serif>). Previous studies have demonstrated that genetic alterations in the genes encoding CATSPER subunits or PMCA4 result in male infertility with defective sperm hyperactivation in mammals (</sans-serif>Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0097">2021</xref><sans-serif>). The importance of these two Ca<sup>2+</sup> paths – CATSPER and PMCA4 – which transport Ca<sup>2+</sup> in opposite directions, highlights their coordination in maintaining Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis, which is crucial for hyperactivated sperm motility and male fertility.</sans-serif></p>
<p><sans-serif>Around 50% of pregnancies are unintended globally (</sans-serif>Bearak et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0014">2020</xref><sans-serif>), which is another reproductive health issue together with infertility. Unintended pregnancy would result in negative outcomes including health problems and social issues like early termination of career and education for both men and women (</sans-serif>Horvath and Schreiber <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0039">2017</xref><sans-serif>;</sans-serif> Nickels and Yan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0069">2024</xref><sans-serif>). In particular, over half of the unwanted pregnancies end in abortion (</sans-serif>Nickels and Yan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0069">2024</xref><sans-serif>), which strongly demands mixed contraception for successful family planning. Currently, women mainly bear the responsibility for contraception, whereas men only rely on two methods of contraception: condom and vasectomy (</sans-serif>Amory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">2023</xref><sans-serif>). Given the accumulating knowledge on male reproduction at the molecular level, the demand for novel male contraceptive development continues to grow.</sans-serif></p>

<title>Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in sperm hyperactivation</title>
<p><sans-serif>In the female reproductive tract, mammalian sperm undergo changes in physiological characteristics to acquire fertilizing ability, a process called capacitation (</sans-serif>Austin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">1951</xref><sans-serif>;</sans-serif> Chang <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0019">1951</xref><sans-serif>). One of the most outstanding changes is that sperm start to beat their flagella asymmetrically with an increased amplitude (</sans-serif>Yanagimachi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0101">1969</xref><sans-serif>,</sans-serif>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0102">1970</xref><sans-serif>). This unique flagellar beating changes the sperm swimming pattern, so-called hyperactivated motility, giving them sufficient force to pass through the viscous environment (</sans-serif>DeMott et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0026">1995</xref><sans-serif>) and penetrate the glycoprotein barrier of the eggs, the zona pellucida (</sans-serif>Stauss et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0088">1995</xref><sans-serif>). Therefore, hyperactivated motility is essential for successful sperm navigation to the eggs and fertilization.</sans-serif></p>
<p><sans-serif>The development of hyperactivated motility is regulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> (</sans-serif>Ho et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0037">2002</xref><sans-serif>;</sans-serif> Lindemann and Goltz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0050">1988</xref><sans-serif>;</sans-serif> Suarez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0091">1987</xref><sans-serif>;</sans-serif> Yanagimachi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0103">1982</xref><sans-serif>), which transduces cell signals in diverse systems. Previous studies have demonstrated that mammalian sperm fail to develop hyperactivated motility during <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> capacitation in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> supplementation (</sans-serif>Yanagimachi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0103">1982</xref><sans-serif>). Mouse sperm treated with A23187, a Ca<sup>2+</sup> ionophore, can develop hyperactivated motility (</sans-serif>Suarez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0091">1987</xref><sans-serif>). In addition, the tail of demembranated rat and bull sperm, of which membrane is dissolved by mild non-ionic detergent, generate a huge curvature upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> exposure (</sans-serif>Ho et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0037">2002</xref><sans-serif>;</sans-serif> Lindemann and Goltz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0050">1988</xref><sans-serif>). Furthermore, other studies have revealed that sperm developing hyperactivated motility have increased intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>) both <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> (</sans-serif>Babcock and Pfeiffer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0011">1987</xref><sans-serif>;</sans-serif> Suarez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0090">1993</xref><sans-serif>). All the results clearly demonstrate that Ca<sup>2+</sup> is the key component to trigger hyperactivated motility in mammalian sperm.</sans-serif></p>
<p><sans-serif>Although now it is well known that [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> increase is essential for the development of hyperactivated motility in mammalian sperm, how the increased [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> regulates downstream signaling in capacitated sperm remains unclear. A few studies have demonstrated that defective Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase potentiates PKA signaling and global tyrosine phosphorylation excessively (</sans-serif>Chung et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0023">2014</xref><sans-serif>;</sans-serif> Navarrete et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0067">2015</xref><sans-serif>). Although this negative correlation indicates that Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling could be linked to various phosphorylation mechanisms in capacitating sperm, how the post-translational modifications and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling coordinate flagellar movement has not been comprehensively elucidated.</sans-serif></p>

<title>Gates for Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in sperm</title>
<p><sans-serif>Extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the female reproductive tract is the original source of increased [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in sperm to develop hyperactivated motility. Sperm increase [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> by introducing extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> via the Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry path to develop hyperactivated motility. However, excessive [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> could make sperm immotile transiently by inhibiting flagellar beating (</sans-serif>Sanchez-Cardenas et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0081">2018</xref><sans-serif>;</sans-serif> Suarez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0091">1987</xref><sans-serif>). This means that continued Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and the resulting excessive [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> would prevent sperm from swimming and hyperactivation. Therefore, both the influx and efflux of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the sperm should be balanced to maintain a range of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> for flagellar beating and hyperactivated motility.</sans-serif></p>

<title>Catsper – the primary Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry path in sperm</title>
<p>
<sans-serif>Various ion channels such as voltage-gated channels and transient receptor potential (TRP) channels have been suggested as the major Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry sites for sperm hyperactivation. However, currently, the sperm-specific Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel, CATSPER, is known as the primary channel to introduce Ca<sup>2+</sup> into mammalian sperm.</sans-serif>

<title>Molecular characteristics</title>
<p><sans-serif>The CATSPER channel is a multiprotein complex composed of at least 13 subunits (</sans-serif><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2</xref>(A); Hwang and Chung <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0043">2023</xref><sans-serif>). CATSPER1-4 are six transmembrane (TM) proteins that carry a voltage-sensing domain and form a heterotetrameric pore in a way reminiscent of voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels (</sans-serif>Qi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0076">2007</xref><sans-serif>;</sans-serif> Quill et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0077">2001</xref><sans-serif>;</sans-serif> Ren et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0079">2001</xref><sans-serif>). Interestingly, all pore subunits carry a coiled-coil domain at their C-terminus, which could be involved in the interaction within the subunits to form pore (</sans-serif>Lobley et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0055">2003</xref><sans-serif>). Four auxiliary subunits, CATSPERβ, γ, δ, and ϵ, are predicted to be type I TM proteins with a huge extracellular domain (</sans-serif>Chung et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0022">2011</xref><sans-serif>,</sans-serif>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0021">2017</xref><sans-serif>;</sans-serif> Liu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0054">2007</xref><sans-serif>;</sans-serif> Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0096">2009</xref><sans-serif>). Recently resolved atomic structure of the mouse CATSPER channel complex revealed that the four auxiliary subunits form a canopy structure above the pore in sperm (</sans-serif>Lin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0049">2021</xref><sans-serif>;</sans-serif> Zhao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0107">2022</xref><sans-serif>). Two proteins, CATSPERζ and EFCAB9, are cytosolic subunits which form a binary complex to modulate CATSPER channel activity as the pH-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor (</sans-serif>Chung et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0021">2017</xref><sans-serif>;</sans-serif> Hwang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0044">2019</xref><sans-serif>). These 10 subunits are considered to form one functional CATSPER channel complex. Interestingly, recent cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) studies have revealed that individual CATSPER channels link each other and arrange to zig-zag row (</sans-serif>Lin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0049">2021</xref><sans-serif>;</sans-serif> Zhao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0107">2022</xref><sans-serif>) to form quadrilinear CATSPER nanodomains along the principal piece of sperm tail (</sans-serif><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2</xref><sans-serif>(B,C);</sans-serif> Chung et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0023">2014</xref><sans-serif>;</sans-serif> Hwang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0044">2019</xref><sans-serif>). Two newly identified TM subunits, CATSPERη and CATSPERθ, which were previously annotated to Tmem262 and Tmem249, respectively, are suggested to link each CATSPER channel (</sans-serif>Huang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0040">2023</xref><sans-serif>;</sans-serif> Lin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0049">2021</xref><sans-serif>). The last identified component is an anionic transporter Slco6c1</sans-serif> (Lin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0049">2021</xref><sans-serif>)</sans-serif>. This subunit is composed of 12 TMs with Kazal domain and is located on the side of CATSPERϵ as a wing-like structure in the complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2</xref>(B)).

Among them, male mice with the genetic alteration of TM subunits are 100% infertile. The males do not show defective spermatogenesis and their sperm are morphologically normal. However, sperm from the mouse models lacking TM subunits do not carry the functional CATSPER channel (</sans-serif>Chung et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0022">2011</xref><sans-serif>;</sans-serif> Huang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0040">2023</xref><sans-serif>;</sans-serif> Qi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0076">2007</xref><sans-serif>) and fail to develop hyperactivated motility. Therefore, sperm lacking the CATSPER channel are unable to swim against flow (rheotaxis), pass the UTJ, and penetrate zona pellucida (</sans-serif>Miki and Clapham <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0061">2013</xref><sans-serif>;</sans-serif> Ren et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0079">2001</xref><sans-serif>). Sperm from the male mice lacking one of the TM subunits express the other subunits in the testes (</sans-serif>Chung et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0021">2017</xref><sans-serif>). However, the remaining subunits in the testes fail to assemble and to localize at the sperm tail, which results in the absence of entire CATSPER subunits in mature sperm (</sans-serif>Chung et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0021">2017</xref><sans-serif>;</sans-serif> Hwang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0044">2019</xref><sans-serif>;</sans-serif> Qi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0076">2007</xref><sans-serif>). This extremely strong interdependency within the subunits highlights that the CATSPER channel complex should be assembled precisely to traffic successfully to the mature sperm tail during germ cell development in mice.</sans-serif></p>
<p><sans-serif>By contrast, <italic toggle="yes">Catsperz</italic>- and <italic toggle="yes">Efcab9</italic>-null males are subfertile (</sans-serif>Chung et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0021">2017</xref><sans-serif>;</sans-serif> Hwang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0044">2019</xref><sans-serif>). These two cytosolic subunits are interdependent and directly interact to form a binary complex in mature sperm. The absence of either CATSPERζ or EFCAB9 remains only ∼20% of the functional CATSPER channel with fragmented arrangement along the tail. Interestingly, sperm lacking CATSPERζ-EFCAB9 have a tail with a rigid proximal region and fail to develop hyperactivated motility. This could be due to the altered Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry into the sperm, which is reviewed below. Recent studies have revealed that a CATSPER-associated protein, CATSPERτ, manages flagellar targeting of the assembled CATSPER component (</sans-serif>Hwang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0046">2022</xref><sans-serif>;</sans-serif> Yang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0104">2022</xref><sans-serif>). Loss-of-function of the CATSPERτ does not affect CATSPER channel assembly. However, CATSPERτ-deficient sperm only have less than 10% of the functional CATSPER channel with the defective organization of the CATSPER nanodomain (</sans-serif>Hwang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0046">2022</xref>). In line with the studies, the CATSPER nanodomain structure is well preserved in sperm to develop hyperactivated motility (Chung et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0023">2014</xref><sans-serif>) and to reach the fertilizing site (</sans-serif>Ded et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0025">2020</xref><sans-serif>). These results indicate that there could be a threshold amount of CATSPER channel for normal sperm hyperactivation, which also requires the intact quadrilinear nanodomain structure.</sans-serif></p>
<p><sans-serif>In humans, genetic aberrations in <italic toggle="yes">CATSPER1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">2</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">E</italic> have been reported (</sans-serif>Avenarius et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">2009</xref><sans-serif>;</sans-serif> Avidan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">2003</xref><sans-serif>;</sans-serif> Brown et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0016">2018</xref><sans-serif>;</sans-serif> Luo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0057">2019</xref><sans-serif>).

<title>Functional regulation</title>
<p><sans-serif>Like other voltage-gated channels, the heterotetrameric pore of the CATSPER channel carries voltage-sensing domains (</sans-serif>Qi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0076">2007</xref><sans-serif>;</sans-serif> Quill et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0077">2001</xref><sans-serif>;</sans-serif> Ren et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0079">2001</xref><sans-serif>). However, the CATSPER is only weakly voltage-dependent. Interestingly, the voltage sensitivity is drastically increased by elevated pH<sub>i</sub> in mouse sperm (</sans-serif>Kirichok et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0048">2006</xref><sans-serif>). Thus, intracellular alkalinization facilitates activation of the CATSPER channel in mouse sperm, which is supported by increasing [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and pH<sub>i</sub> both in capacitated sperm (</sans-serif>Babcock and Pfeiffer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0011">1987</xref><sans-serif>). Although the factor to activate CATSPER channel has been well demonstrated, the molecular mechanisms underlying the CATSPER activation have not been well understood. Recently, Hwang et al., reported that EFCAB9-CATSPERζ binary complex is the pH-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor for modulating CATSPER channel activity in mouse sperm (</sans-serif>Hwang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0044">2019</xref><sans-serif>). Initially, EFCAB9 and CATSPERζ tightly bind each other, and the interaction presumably block the pore to prevent aberrant Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx via the CATSPER channel in non-capacitated sperm with acidic pH<sub>i</sub>. Then, in capacitating sperm, these two cytosolic subunits start to be dissociated by intracellular alkalinization, which might open the pore to introduce the extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> into the sperm. Finally, the introduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> could bind to the EF-hand domains of the EFCAB9 to further potentiate the CATSPER channel by its conformational change. Considering the mammalian-specific preservation of the CATSPERζ and its conserved interaction to EFCAB9 in marsupials (</sans-serif>Hwang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0045">2021</xref><sans-serif>), the activation mechanism is expected to be conserved in mammals.</sans-serif></p>
<p><sans-serif>Intracellular alkalinization also potentiates CATSPER channel in human sperm (</sans-serif>Lishko et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0051">2010</xref><sans-serif>). However, the CATSPER requires steroidal hormones, progesterone and prostaglandin, to be fully activated in human sperm (</sans-serif>Lishko et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0052">2011</xref><sans-serif>;</sans-serif> Strünker et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0089">2011</xref><sans-serif>).

<title>Pmca4 – the Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion path in sperm</title>
<p><sans-serif>Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx is the key trigger to develop hyperactivated motility in mammalian sperm.

<p><sans-serif>PMCA4 is a P-type ATPase which transports Ca<sup>2+</sup> from cytoplasm to outside of the cells by hydrolyzing ATP. Like other Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase pumps, PMCA4 is a 10 TM protein, and the cytoplasmic domains carry various sites to regulate its function (</sans-serif>Withers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0099">2006</xref><sans-serif>). Especially, a cytoplasmic domain between S4 and S5 carries an ATP-binding and a catalytic site with an aspartyl-phosphate intermediate site generated from ATP hydrolysis. In addition, there are two Mg<sup>2+</sup> binding sites, which facilitate its enzymatic activity (</sans-serif>Post et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0074">2010</xref><sans-serif>). There are multiple phosphorylation sites that also regulate PMCA4 activity (</sans-serif>Enyedi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0030">1996</xref><sans-serif>). Cytosolic C-terminus of the PMCA4 is the domain where the multiple proteins interact. PMCA4 carries two calmodulin (CaM)-binding sites (</sans-serif>Enyedi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0031">1994</xref><sans-serif>;</sans-serif> Falchetto et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0033">1991</xref><sans-serif>), which serve as autoinhibitory roles in other Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase pumps by hiding ATP binding site in S4-S5 cytosolic domain at the low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> condition (</sans-serif>Withers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0099">2006</xref><sans-serif>). Furthermore, the c-terminus functions as a ligand for PDZ domain (</sans-serif>Kim et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0047">1998</xref><sans-serif>), which interacts with PDZ-containing proteins such as Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM-dependent membrane-associated kinase, CASK (</sans-serif>Schuh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0084">2003</xref><sans-serif>), and nitric oxide synthase (NOS;</sans-serif> Duan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0029">2013</xref><sans-serif>).

Interestingly, <italic toggle="yes">Pmca4</italic>-null mice are infertile only in males and their sperm motility is severely compromised. Although sperm lacking PMCA4 can be motile, their swimming velocity is significantly lower than that of normal sperm.

<p><sans-serif>As described above, PMCA4 carries CaM binding sites. At low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> condition, CaM binds to the C-terminus of the PMCA4 to prevent enzymatic catalysis for the Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion. Once [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> increases, CaM binds to the free Ca<sup>2+</sup> and is released from the PMCA4 to make the pump functional (</sans-serif>Withers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0099">2006</xref><sans-serif>). In addition, Mg<sup>2+</sup> also increases PMCA4 function (</sans-serif>Post et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0074">2010</xref><sans-serif>). Recent studies report that PMCA4 could be functionally associated with nitric oxide signaling and phosphorylation (</sans-serif>Andrews et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0006">2015</xref><sans-serif>;</sans-serif> Aravindan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0007">2012</xref><sans-serif>;</sans-serif> Olli et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0072">2018</xref><sans-serif>). PMCA4 interacts with the nitric oxide synthase via its PDZ ligand, and the interaction is stronger in capacitated sperm rather than non-capacitated sperm in humans (</sans-serif>Andrews et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0006">2015</xref><sans-serif>). Like neuronal cells and endothelial cells where PMCA4 suppresses NOS activity (</sans-serif>Holton et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0038">2010</xref><sans-serif>;</sans-serif> Schuh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0085">2001</xref><sans-serif>), PMCA4-deficiency increases NOS activity, especially in capacitated sperm, to elevate peroxinite levels to cause apoptosis in sperm (</sans-serif>Olli et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0072">2018</xref><sans-serif>). Considering PMCA4 recruits NOS near the plasma membrane to form cGMP microdomain in the heart (</sans-serif>Mohamed et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0065">2011</xref><sans-serif>), PMCA4 could regulate nitric oxide signaling and cGMP-mediated signaling in sperm. In addition, CASK also interacts with PMCA4 via PDZ domain in sperm (</sans-serif>Aravindan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0007">2012</xref><sans-serif>). This result suggests that PMCA4 could be involved in downstream phosphorylation events via CASK in sperm. Currently, detailed PMCA4-mediated signaling pathways associated with nitric oxide and phosphorylation are unclear. Yet, the signaling pathways seem to be physiologically significant as PMCA4 and its interacting components could be supplied through secreted exosomes at their pass in the male and female reproductive tract (</sans-serif>Al-Dossary et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">2013</xref><sans-serif>;</sans-serif> Martin-DeLeon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0059">2015</xref><sans-serif>;</sans-serif> Patel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0073">2013</xref><sans-serif>).</sans-serif></p>

<p><sans-serif>Although low birth rates are one of the biggest social issues in many developed countries including South Korea (</sans-serif>Hwang <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0041">2023a</xref><sans-serif>), many couples and individuals have been suffering from unwanted pregnancies globally. Surprisingly, unintended pregnancy, which is another major issue for reproductive health in opposite to infertility and low-birth rate issues, happens around 213 million times annually (</sans-serif>Nickels and Yan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0069">2024</xref><sans-serif>). This causes health issues, such as low birth weight and increased risk for pre-termination of the birth, and social issues including problems in mentality, finance, and career opportunities for the family members (</sans-serif>Nickels and Yan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0069">2024</xref><sans-serif>). More strikingly, up to 66% of cases of unwanted pregnancies are eventually ended up in abortion, which also causes health issues for mothers (</sans-serif>Bearak et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0014">2020</xref><sans-serif>;</sans-serif> Finer and Zolna <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0034">2016</xref><sans-serif>).</sans-serif></p>
<p><sans-serif>Many couples have their child based on family planning due to the negative outcomes of unintended pregnancy these days. The need for family planning also requires the development of novel contraceptive systems (</sans-serif>Nickels and Yan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0069">2024</xref><sans-serif>). Currently, contraception methods are dominantly oriented to the woman. Multiple methods are available for contraception in women such as hormonal pills, intrauterine devices, intravaginal rings, tubal ligation, spermicides, and physical barriers. By contrast, condoms and vasectomy are the only two methods for male contraception, which makes women mainly responsible for contraception (</sans-serif>Campo-Engelstein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0018">2012</xref><sans-serif>).</sans-serif></p>
<p><sans-serif>Interestingly, previous studies reveal that this discrepancy is not simply due to men’s unwillingness to use novel contraceptive systems. Although there are some variations, a certain proportion of men are interested in new male contraceptives (</sans-serif>Glasier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0035">2010</xref><sans-serif>;</sans-serif> Nguyen and Jacobsohn <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0068">2023</xref><sans-serif>). From 34 to 82% of the men are willing to participate in clinical trials for novel contraceptives, depending on their societies (</sans-serif>Nickels and Yan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0069">2024</xref><sans-serif>). Additionally, women strongly support the concept of their partners using male contraceptives (</sans-serif>Reynolds-Wright et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0080">2021</xref><sans-serif>). These studies clearly indicate that there is a common demand to develop novel male contraceptives in both men and women. The social demand is also well reflected by the predicted market sizes of male contraceptives, which are over 12 million in the United States and are over 400 million dollars worldwide (</sans-serif>Dorman and Bishai <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0028">2012</xref><sans-serif>;</sans-serif> Nickels and Yan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0069">2024</xref><sans-serif>).</sans-serif></p>

<title>Targets and strategies to develop male contraceptives</title>
<p><sans-serif>Indeed, there have been continuous trials to develop male contraceptives. Hormonal regulation is critical for normal spermatogenesis (</sans-serif>Ahn et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0001">2022</xref><sans-serif>;</sans-serif> Sheng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0086">2024</xref><sans-serif>). Thus, increasing testosterone level which suppresses gonadotrophic secretion from the pituitary and hypothalamus, has been applied for a strategy of male contraception (</sans-serif>Long et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0056">2021</xref><sans-serif>). Despite its significant effects to reduce sperm counts and the successful inhibition of male fertility (</sans-serif>Nieschlag <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0070">2010</xref><sans-serif>;</sans-serif> Wang and Swerdloff <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0095">2022</xref><sans-serif>), continued clinical trials using hormonal contraception have reported various side effects, such as depression and mood swings (</sans-serif>Behre et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0015">2016</xref><sans-serif>). The limits for hormonal application request the development of novel male contraceptives.</sans-serif></p>
<p><sans-serif>Hormonal contraceptives aim to deplete male germ cells like non-obstructive azoospermia patients lacking mature sperm in their ejaculates. However, different from the female germ cells, to eliminate the entire sperm in the male gonad is barely feasible due to their huge and rapid generation during spermatogenesis (</sans-serif>Griswold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0036">2016</xref><sans-serif>). Many proteins are essential for early spermatogenesis, and disrupting the targets might remove mature sperm significantly. However, their isoforms are also shared in diverse somatic cells (</sans-serif>Suzuki et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0092">2019</xref><sans-serif>;</sans-serif> Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0106">2017</xref><sans-serif>), indicating that targeting these candidates could cause various side effects in other tissues. In addition, developed sperm cells, which overcome the intended disruption of early spermatogenesis, could have chromosomal abnormalities to result in birth defects (</sans-serif>Nickels and Yan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0069">2024</xref><sans-serif>). Furthermore, the depletion of all male germ cells could be irreversible which is not suitable for future family planning. Notably, numerous infertile males still produce mature sperm with functional defects (</sans-serif>Curi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0024">2003</xref><sans-serif>). Thus, accumulating studies have focused on targeting the late stage of spermatogenesis after finishing meiosis, when the corresponding haploid germ cells, round spermatids, express various sperm-specific proteins (</sans-serif>Matzuk and Lamb <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0060">2008</xref><sans-serif>). Mouse model studies well demonstrate that disrupting the candidates expressed during the late spermatogenesis step can induce 100% male infertility without gross abnormalities, including sperm generation (</sans-serif>Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0097">2021</xref><sans-serif>). Therefore, gene products expressed exclusively in post-meiotic germ cells, such as round or elongating spermatids and even mature sperm, are suggested as high-priority targets for male contraceptives (</sans-serif>Yan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0100">2009</xref><sans-serif>).</sans-serif></p>

<title>Current progresses on non-hormonal male contraceptives</title>
<p><sans-serif>Several proteins have been suggested as targets for pharmacological male contraceptives. Especially, recent two studies have made impressive progresses in developing male contraceptives by targeting post-meiotic components to disrupt sperm function (</sans-serif>Balbach et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0013">2023</xref><sans-serif>;</sans-serif> Chang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0020">2021</xref><sans-serif>). Chang et al., reported triptonide, which is isolated from a natural plant, <italic toggle="yes">Tripterygium wilfordii,</italic> as a non-hormonal male contraceptive (</sans-serif>Chang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0020">2021</xref><sans-serif>). Oral intake of triptonide results in male infertility by impairing sperm morphology and motility in mice and monkeys. Long-term intake does not affect severe defects in both animal models except for male infertility. Surprisingly, male mice and monkeys can rescue their fertility after stopping to take triptonide in several weeks, which indicates that the chemical can be applicable for non-hormonal and reversible male contraceptives. Triptonide appears to function by binding to plakoglobin to alter its interaction with the SPEM1 during spermiogenesis. Balbach et al., introduced a new allosteric inhibitor for soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) as an on-demand male contraceptive (</sans-serif>Balbach et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0013">2023</xref><sans-serif>). sAC generates cyclic AMP by binding to bicarbonate which is abundant in female reproductive tract (∼25 mM) to initiate signaling for capacitation and motility activation of ejaculated sperm (</sans-serif>Buffone et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0017">2014</xref><sans-serif>;</sans-serif> Wennemuth et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0098">2003</xref><sans-serif>). Thus, functional defects of the sAC cause male infertility in humans and mice (</sans-serif>Akbari et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">2019</xref><sans-serif>;</sans-serif> Esposito et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0032">2004</xref><sans-serif>). The small molecule, TDI-11861, suppresses sAC function more efficiently than its predecessor, TDI-10229 (</sans-serif>Balbach et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0012">2021</xref><sans-serif>). TDI-11861 does not significantly affect the functions of other kinases and membrane proteins with low cytotoxicity, which is further supported by the normal behavior without gross abnormalities in mice taking it. Oral delivery of TDI-11861 can be effective at least after 1 h by blocking enzymatic activity significantly, which impairs epididymal sperm motility. In addition, the ejaculated sperm from males treated with TDI-11861 by intraperitoneal injection are immotile. Surprisingly, epididymal sperm are almost immotile only after 15 min of TDI-11861 injection, which can be recovered in 24 h. Furthermore, around 90% of males can rescue their fertility after 1–5 days from a single injection of TDI-11861. The rapid effect to cause male infertility and its successful recovery highlight that the sAC inhibitor can be applicable as an on-demand male contraceptive. Together with the studies, other molecules, such as ATP1A4, GAPDHS, EPPIN, SLO3, and CATSPER, are expected for the target to develop male contraceptives (</sans-serif>Mariani et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0058">2023</xref><sans-serif>).</sans-serif></p>
