<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par29">Neuromuscular diseases comprise a spectrum of disorders affecting motor neurons in the spinal cord, sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglia, peripheral nerves, neuromuscular junction and/or skeletal muscles. Cranial nerves (and their nuclei) as well as components of the vegetative system can be also affected. These diseases mainly compromise motricity and sensation and may be a consequence of many different causes including acquired and genetic factors. While for most of the acquired neuromuscular diseases a progressive number of therapies have been discovered and are now used in clinical practice, there is still a significant unmet need for the development of curative treatments for inherited and degenerative forms. This landscape is rapidly changing though, with therapies already available in clinical practice and others under evaluation in clinical trials or preclinical studies.</p>
<p id="Par30">The most compelling therapeutic approaches for inherited disorders can be delineated as follows (see also Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>):<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par31">Treatments designed to rectify genetic anomalies at the DNA level, including gene replacement, gene editing, and gene addition (i.e., the provision/upregulation of proteins that compensate for the mutant gene); these can be termed “gene therapies”.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par32">Molecular therapies directed at modulating RNA transcripts, such as the use of antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) or small molecules to promote alternative splicing or the implementation of double-stranded, small interfering RNA (siRNA) to suppress pathogenic variants that cause toxic gain of function.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par33">Infusion of progenitor cells (cell therapies) to replace or modulate the function of damaged cells, a strategy that is currently more suitable for skeletal muscle.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par34">Interventions aimed at post-translational modifications of specific proteins, exemplified by post-translational glycosylation of α-dystroglycanopathies.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par35">Treatments targeting one or multiple downstream effects including inflammation, fibrosis, excessive reactive oxygen species, membrane instability, protein aggregates accumulation etc.</p></list-item></list><fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Schematic representation of the therapeutic landscape applicable to neuromuscular diseases, with a focus on gene and molecular therapies. Treatment strategies vary according to the underlying genetic defect, namely loss of function (LOF) or gain of function (GOF) mutations (depicted in the centre of the figure). A defective gene may be corrected at DNA level via gene editing/silencing obtained, for instance, using Crispr/Cas9 technology, with still important concerns regarding possible off-target events. Alternatively, coding (c)DNA containing a tissue-specific promoter and a gene cassette encoding for a functional or surrogate protein can be delivered by viral vectors and be subsequently translated by the cell apparatus. The persistence of cDNA in time may vary according to cell type. Molecular therapies can act at RNA level either by modulating splicing or by altering messenger (m)RNA transcription. The former strategy is usually obtained using antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) (<bold>A</bold>), as the ones developed for exon skipping in Duchenne muscular dystrophy or to counteract the splicing of exon 7 of the <italic>SMN2</italic> gene in spinal muscular atrophy. Of note, ASO can be conjugated with cell-penetrating peptides, fatty acids, or specific antibodies to increase their delivery to target organs, in order to augment efficacy while reducing potential side effects. The modulation of RNA transcription can be obtained by single-stranded ASO or by double stranded short interfering (si)RNA. The latter can be either directly delivered to cells or processed from short/small hairpin (sh)RNA (<bold>B</bold>). Lastly, both gene and molecular therapies can be delivered by different viral and non-viral vectors (including nanoparticles and cells), which are being constantly improved</p></caption><graphic id="MO1" xlink:href="18_2024_5229_Fig1_HTML"></graphic></fig></p>
<p id="Par36">Both gene and molecular therapies can be delivered by viral or non-viral vectors (such as lipid nanoparticles or engineered cell lines), each characterized by a specific profile of loading capacity, tissue trophism/specificity etc. Cellular therapy can be utilized both for its direct effects and as a carrier of therapeutic products.</p>

<title>Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA)</title>
<p id="Par38">5q SMA is an AR neuromuscular disorder caused by mutations in <italic>SMN1</italic> gene leading to defective expression of the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein. SMN is a ubiquitously expressed protein whose deficiency causes the abnormal development and subsequent degeneration of alpha motor neurons in the spinal cord [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The clinical picture is characterized by progressive weakness and atrophy affecting skeletal, respiratory, and bulbar muscles. The global prevalence is approximately 1:10.000 individuals, making SMA among the more frequent neuromuscular disorders. SMA encompasses a spectrum of severity, with its most severe form presenting in infancy and leading to significant disability and early mortality. Historically, SMA has been divided in different sub-types based on the age of onset and achievement of motor milestones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. SMA type 0 manifest antenatally, SMA type 1 between 0 and 6 months (patients never acquire the ability to sit), SMA type 2 between 7 and 18 months (patients never acquire the ability to walk), SMA type 3 between 1.5 and 10 years (patients usually acquire the ability to walk which is later lost), and SMA type 4 in adulthood. The disease severity largely (but not exclusively) depends on the number of copies of a paralogue gene called <italic>SMN2</italic>. <italic>SMN2</italic> differs from <italic>SMN1</italic> due to a single nucleotide variant that causes an abnormal splicing. This variant specifically produces the exclusion of exon 7, leading to the production of a truncated protein that is quickly degraded. Consequently, a single copy of the SMN2 gene typically generates only approximately 10% of the full-length SMN protein. Hence, a higher percentage of functional protein is produced in presence of a higher number of <italic>SMN2</italic> copies, contributing to the partial amelioration of the clinical phenotype. Other exonic/intronic <italic>SMN2</italic> variants that further affecting splicing may explain the mismatch observed in some patients between the number of <italic>SMN2</italic> copies and clinical severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p>
<p id="Par39">Until few years ago the treatment of SMA was uniquely supportive, with limited beneficial effect achieved by the administration of β-adrenergic agonists in milder forms. However, the advances in the understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms led to the development of targeted therapies, transforming the treatment landscape for this condition with 3 different compounds approved by US and European regulators (FDA and EMA) at the time of this review.</p>

<title>Gene therapies</title>
<p id="Par40">Onasemnogene Abeparvovec (Zolgensma) was the first FDA and EMA-approved gene replacement therapy in the field of neuromuscular disorders. This involves a one-time intravenous infusion of a recombinant AAV9 virus containing a functional copy of the <italic>SMN1</italic> gene and is indicated for patients affected by SMA type 1 (EMA). Zolgensma was first tested in an open-label, phase I clinical trial in a small cohort of early-onset patients and has shown remarkable efficacy in prolonging survival and maintaining motor, bulbar and respiratory function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Safety and efficacy findings were confirmed in larger cohort of patients and in real-world data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Given the rapid deterioration of motor neuron, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] it is not surprising that, in line with what observed with other compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], the magnitude of the effect is greater when patients are treated in a pre-symptomatic stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The main side effects of gene therapy are related to the immune reaction against the capsid. This is greater the higher the dose aministered. Elevated serum levels of liver enzymes may be observed after infusion but can be controlled by steroid conditioning, as well transient platelet reduction. Thrombotic microangiopathy has been anedoctally reported in real-world observations. Weight-based dosing still poses safety considerations due to higher viral load in heavier patients. Thus, studies are ongoing to prove safety and efficacy in children up to 21 kg (NCT04851873) and intrathecal administration of the product is been explored as a way to deliver higher doses of the vector directly to the central nervous system (CNS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p>

<p id="Par41">Both Nusinersen (intrathecal) and Risdiplam (oral) counteract the exclusion of exon 7 of <italic>SMN2</italic> with different biological mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Nusinersen (Spinraza; an ASO) achieved a significant milestone as the first drug to successfully complete randomized sham-controlled clinical trials in early onset SMA cases, leading to its FDA approval in 2016 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Subsequent real-world data and insights from early access programs have confirmed Nusinersen’s safety and efficacy across a more extensive patient population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Furthermore, ongoing research is exploring the potential benefits of higher-dose Nusinersen administration (NCT04089566). Risdiplam (Evrysdi, a small molecule) was approved in the USA for administration across the entire spectrum of SMA patients, and the indication is about to be extended prior to 2 months of age also in other countries. The initial trial (FIREFISH) demonstrated a significant increase in patient survival and function in symptomatic SMA type 1 patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Subsequently, efficacy and safety were proven also in patients with SMA type 2 and non-ambulant SMA type 3 (SUNFISH) aged between 2 and 25 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Importantly, Risdiplam exhibited a favourable safety profile and was well-tolerated in both trials.

<p id="Par43">The development of new therapies has radically changed the prognosis of patients affected by SMA. However, new challenges are emerging. It is likely that new phenotypes will appear following the increased survival of patients belonging to the most severe end of the spectrum. Preclinical studies showed that the lack of SMN protein exerts detrimental effects not only on motor neurons but also on other organs. The multisystem involvement in SMA in humans is still a matter of debate, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] but this could theoretically indicate that a systemic drug should be preferable compared to a product which is administered intrathecally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Gene therapy offers the advantage of a one-shot administration and systemic delivery, but its applicability at present is limited by dose-related side effects. While the use of combinatory strategies in under investigation (e.g., NCT05067790; NCT04488133), the choice of treatment is currently tailored on individual bases and there is no clear evidence indicating a superiority of a therapy over another. Only a systematic collection of real-world data considering possible confounding factors (e.g., genetics, definition of pre-symptomatic state etc.) will help improve the prescription of such treatments and clarify whether some aspects (e.g., bulbar function) are differently addressed by these products. There is strong evidence of a greater effect achieved in patients treated before the onset of symptoms, hence advocating the implementation of newborn screening for SMA.</p>

<p id="Par44">ALS is an unrelenting disease marked by the degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons, leading to progressive muscle paralysis and, ultimately, fatal respiratory failure within 3–5 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Despite ALS being perceived as a monolithic entity, it represents a broad disease spectrum encompassing various clinical phenotypes likely caused by distinct pathogenetic mechanisms, all converging on the common outcome of motor neuron degeneration. Furthermore, the coexistence of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) within this spectrum adds an additional layer of complexity underscoring the intricate relationship between motor neuron degeneration and cognitive and behavioral changes. Over the past two decades, advancements in ALS genetics have witnessed exponential growth, providing robust insights into the underlying pathogenesis of this condition charting the course for more precise and targeted treatment approaches.</p>
<p id="Par45">The identification of the Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase type-1 (<italic>SOD1</italic>) gene as the first causative factor of ALS in 1993 constituted a groundbreaking discovery in the genetics of this disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Mutations in <italic>SOD1</italic> account for 20% of familial ALS (<italic>f</italic>ALS) cases and 1–2% of sporadic cases (<italic>s</italic>ALS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The pathogenesis of the disease entails a gain-of-neurotoxic function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Mutations in the <italic>SOD1</italic> gene cause an unstable, misfolded protein, resulting in intraneuronal accumulation and cellular damage. Additionally, this misfolded protein could spread via a prion-like trans-neuronal mechanism, leading to spatial dissemination inducing a relentless motoneuronal death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p>
<p id="Par46">Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), encoded by the TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (<italic>TARDBP)</italic> gene, is a multifunctional DNA/RNA binding protein. TDP-43 is recognized for its role in overseeing RNA processes, encompassing RNA splicing, mRNA transport, translation, and the regulation of non-coding RNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In 2006, TDP-43 was identified as the main constituent of pathological cytoplasmic aggregates in ALS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Following this discovery, <italic>TARDBP</italic> gene was identified as causal factors in ALS, contributing to 4% of fALS cases and less than 1% of sALS cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The cytoplasmic accumulation of TDP-43 is associated with a dual mechanism: the loss of TDP-43 function in the nucleus and the acquisition of toxic TDP-43 function in the cytoplasm, or a combination of both. Evidence from <italic>TARDBP</italic> knockout and TDP-43 overexpression models, have demonstrated that both TDP-43 deficiency and excessive TDP-43 can serve as causative factors in ALS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Hence, modulating TDP-43 expression and/or subcellular localization holds promise as a potential therapeutic strategy for <italic>TARDBP</italic>-ALS patients.</p>
<p id="Par47">In 2009, pathogenic variants of the Fused in Sarcoma (<italic>FUS</italic>) gene, were identified as causative factors in ALS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. FUS mutations contribute to approximately 4% of <italic>f</italic>ALS and a less than 1% of <italic>s</italic>ALS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. These mutations exhibit an AD inheritance pattern and lead to a juvenile aggressive form of the disease. <italic>FUS</italic> is a widely expressed RNA-binding protein primarily located in the nucleus, where it plays roles in DNA repair and RNA metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. While the exact pathogenic mechanism of these mutations remains incompletely understood, there is substantial evidence supporting a toxic gain-of-function mechanism in <italic>FUS-</italic>ALS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p>
<p id="Par48">In 2011, the hexanucleotide GGGGCC repeat expansion (HRE) within the first intron of the <italic>C9ORF72</italic> gene was discovered to be causative for ALS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The <italic>C9ORF72</italic> HRE is implicated in roughly 40% of <italic>f</italic>ALS and 7% of <italic>s</italic>ALS, although substantial variability exists among different populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The pathogenesis of <italic>C9ORF72</italic>-ALS, although not fully elucidated, is underpinned by a combination of gain and loss of function mechanisms, as supported by substantial evidence. The HRE is instrumental in giving rise to three distinct pathological hallmarks within <italic>C9ORF72</italic>-ALS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Firstly, it disrupts transcription, leading to <italic>C9ORF72</italic> haploinsufficiency, thereby compromising autophagic processes, deregulating autoimmunity, heightening cellular stress, and perturbing nucleocytoplasmic transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Secondly, bidirectional transcription of the <italic>C9ORF72</italic> HRE generates transcripts that accumulate within cellular nuclei, sequestering RNA-binding proteins and giving rise to RNA foci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Thirdly, both sense and antisense transcripts of the HRE can serve as templates for the repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation, resulting in the production of toxic poly-dipeptides. These dipeptides, prone to aggregation, have been identified in the CNS of individuals with <italic>C9ORF72</italic>- ALS and showed toxicity in cells and animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].</p>

This intervention increased motor neurons, delayed disease onset, and extended survival in transgenic mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Subsequently, two studies reported similar reductions in SOD1 expression within the spinal cord and improved survival outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. In a study exploring the safety profile and exploratory efficacy outcomes, it was shown that an AAV carrying a microRNA (miRNA) targeting SOD1 can suppress the expression of the mutated <italic>SOD1</italic> gene in patients harboring <italic>SOD1</italic> mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. A single intrathecal infusion of AAV encoding SOD1-targeting miRNA was given to two patients. One patient showed a temporary improvement in right leg strength and reduced SOD1 levels in CSF, while the other maintained stable scores on a composite measure of ALS function for 12 months. The effectiveness of CRISPR/Cas9 in targeting (G4C2) repeat DNA or RNA has been recently proved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. These studies aimed to diminish the repetition of RNA transcription or mitigate the levels of RNA foci/DPRs, respectively. It is worth noting that a primary limitation of these investigations lies in the fact that the treatments were administered to mice at a young age before the onset of ALS symptoms. Consequently, it remains unclear how effective this treatment would be in older mice with manifested ALS symptoms. The use of gene editing techniques in ALS caused by the TARDBP and FUS genes has primarily been focused on enhancing the understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms in cellular models, with limited therapeutic applicability data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. As is well-established, cognitive dysfunctions are observed in up to 50% of ALS patients, meeting diagnostic criteria for FTD in approximately 10% of cases (10.1136/jnnp-2013-307223). Consequently, when identifying therapeutic molecular targets and devising delivery strategies, it is essential to recognize that ALS is not solely confined to motor neurons. Neglecting this broader involvement may restrict therapeutic efficacy to the motor aspects of the disease, potentially lacking an impact on cognitive impairments.</p>

<p id="Par50">Tofersen, an ASO, emerged as the foremost targeted therapeutic approach for <italic>SOD1</italic>-ALS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Administered intrathecally, Tofersen targets <italic>SOD1</italic> mRNA, degrading it and reducing SOD1 protein synthesis. It demonstrated an extended survival in a <italic>SOD1</italic>-mutation rodent model compared to the placebo-treated group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Among <italic>SOD1</italic>-ALS patients, Tofersen reduced CSF SOD1 levels and achieved a significant decrease in plasma NfL levels. However, Tofersen failed to achieve statistical significance in reducing the decline in ALS Functional Rating Scale—Revised score (ALSFRS-R), which was the primary clinical endpoint of the 28-week phase III trial (NCT02623699). In the 52-week open-label extension study, patients who received early treatment with Tofersen exhibited significantly less deterioration in ALSFRS-R, respiratory function, grip strength, and patient-reported measures of quality of life compared to the placebo group. The limitations that may have led to an underestimation of the results could include the small sample size and the initiation of therapy at an advanced stage of the disease. In fact, studies are currently underway on presymptomatic and early-stage patients. An alternative strategy for addressing the pathogenic gain-of-function associated with <italic>SOD1</italic> in ALS involves the application of RNA interference (RNAi). This approach stands apart from ASOs due to the structural distinction of RNA molecules, characterized by their double-stranded nature. While double-stranded RNAs may exhibit enhanced resilience during delivery, their functional activity necessitates sequential enzymatic processing stages, contrasting with ASOs that are single-stranded and readily capable of direct target binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In the course of the RNAi process, RNA molecules execute the degradation of mRNAs within the cytoplasm via engagement with the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), ultimately resulting in the suppression of gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Several studies have proved the effectiveness of RNAi strategy in <italic>SOD1</italic> animal models, such as delaying disease onset and increasing survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>].</p>

She had monthly intrathecal infusions with good tolerance and no serious adverse events. Pre-treatment, she lost ~ 5 ALSFRS-R score points monthly, which significantly slowed during therapy. Unfortunately, she died a year after treatment due to worsening ventilatory and bulbar dysfunction. In 2021, a Phase III clinical trial (NCT04768972) started to assess whether ION363 offers any clinical benefit in mitigating disease progression in symptomatic FUS-ALS patients. These individuals undergo intrathecal injections every 4–12 weeks over a 61-week period, followed by injections every 12 weeks during the open-label extension treatment phase, with the study anticipated to conclude in 2024 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p>

When the neuropathy is the predominant feature and both motor and sensory components are affected, it is usually referred as to Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease, which also includes predominant motor forms (distal hereditary motor neuropathy, HMN, or distal spinal muscular atrophy, dSMA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>] and predominant sensory neuropathies (hereditary sensory autonomic neuropathy, HSAN). Although very heterogenous, three main phenotypes are distinguished in CMT according to clinical and neurophysiological criteria: CMT1 or demyelinating forms, characterized by reduced motor conduction velocity at median nerves (MNCV) below 38 m/s as cut-off; CMT2 or axonal neuropathies with almost normal MNCV values higher than 38 m/s, but reduced compound motor action potential (CMAP). CMT neuropathies are now classified using an integration of clinical, neurophysiological, and genetic criteria. Of note, at least 120 responsible genes have been identified thus far, which encode a huge variety of proteins including structural proteins of the myelin, of the axonal cytoskeleton, transcription factors, regulators of intracellular trafficking, of mitochondrial function, of protein synthesis or homeostasis, and ion channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>].

MFN2 is an outer mitochondrial membrane protein which mediates fusion between mitochondria. MFN2 seems to be also involved in mitochondrial transport. In vitro and in vivo studies suggested that mitochondrial abnormalities can be reversed by stabilizing the interaction between the normal copies of MFN2 and MFN1, homologous to MFN2 but expressed at very low levels in axons. Small molecules have been developed as agonist of mitofusin function showing promising results in mutant mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">107</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">108</xref>].</p>
<p id="Par67">Acetylation of tubulin is known to stabilize axonal microtubule network thus facilitating anterograde transport. Decreased tubulin acetylation has been shown in several models of axonal CMT2 neuropathies, thus suggesting that this mechanism can represent a commonality across different axonal forms independently on the specific pathogenetic mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. Consistent with this, small molecules able to inhibit HDAC6 (histone deacetylase), an enzyme that deacetylases alpha tubulin, ameliorate the neuropathic phenotype in different CMT2 mouse models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">109</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">110</xref>]. Another promising approach as unifying treatment strategy for different axonal neuropathies consists in the drug-mediated inhibition of SARM1 activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">111</xref>]. When axons are severed, SARM1 is activated and rapidly hydrolases NAD + provoking a dramatic loss of ATP and mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to axonal degeneration. Mutant mice with loss of Sarm1 are protected from axon degeneration. Thus, inhibition of SARM1 activity has been thought to prevent or reduce axonal degeneration also in CMTs. Small molecule inhibitors are under development with one promising candidate, DSRM-3716 able to prevent axonal degeneration after axotomy in sensory neurons established from human iPSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">112</xref>].</p>

<title>The CMT1A neuropathy</title>
<p id="Par68">CMT1A is a demyelinating generally slowly progressive neuropathy caused by 1.4 Mb duplication on chromosome 17p11.2 encompassing the <italic>PMP22</italic> gene, which encodes the peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22). As a consequence of an inequal crossing over event at the meiotic cell division, CMT1A patients carry three copies of the <italic>PMP22</italic> gene whereas the reciprocal event, the <italic>PMP22</italic> gene deletion, is associated with the HNPP neuropathy (Hereditary liability to pressure palsies) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref>]. A gene dosage effect has been proposed at the basis of the CMT1A Schwann cell pathogenesis. PMP22 proteins tends to misfold and aggregate and these events are physiologically resolved through the proteasome. In CMT1A patient cells, this mechanism is less efficient as proteasome is overwhelmed and blocked resulting in the activation of cell stress mechanisms. Animal models carrying several copies of <italic>PMP22</italic> recapitulate proteostatic stress with PMP22 accumulation and have also highlighted a role for PMP22 in Schwann cell differentiation during early stages of postnatal nerve development.

<title>Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (hATTR)</title>
<p id="Par73">Hereditary amyloidosis resulting from mutations in the TTR gene (hATTR) is a rare, progressively debilitating, and potentially life-threatening autosomal dominant multisystem disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">124</xref>]. This condition results from the systemic accumulation of misfolded transthyretin, a transport protein for thyroxine and retinol. Clinical presentations vary, often showing initial symptoms related to peripheral nervous system involvement, such as small fiber neuropathy, autonomic dysfunction, and peripheral polyneuropathy. This diverse spectrum in hATTR underlines its complexity, not entirely explained by genetic diversity alone, despite some genotype–phenotype correlation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">124</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">125</xref>]. The most prevalent mutation worldwide, p.Val50Met, can manifest as either early-onset small fiber and autonomic involvement or late-onset “classic” peripheral polyneuropathy, primarily due to large fibers degeneration coexisting with cardiac amyloid deposition, typically remaining subclinical. Conversely, p.Val142Ile is the most frequent mutation in the US and is distinguished by its early and prominent cardiac manifestations. More than 120 pathogenic TTR mutations have been documented, each associated with a subtly distinct pattern of disease onset, symptoms, and progression.</p>
<p id="Par74">TTR is a homotetrameric protein, with each monomeric unit being encoded by a small four exon gene. Each monomeric unit consists of 127 amino acid protein arranged in eight anti-parallel β-sheets. This characteristic structural arrangement partially accounts for the heightened amyloidogenic potential exhibited by this protein. Mutations within the TTR gene result in destabilization of the native tetrameric structure. Consequently, misfolded subunits tend to self-assemble into amyloid fibrils, which subsequently accumulate within various tissues, ultimately culminating in the development of disease. The deposition of amyloid derived from TTR in the peripheral nervous system appears to initiate at the level of sympathetic and dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126">126</xref>]. Over time, this deposition propagates along the course of the nerves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">127</xref>]. However, the precise mechanisms underpinning neurodegeneration remain uncertain. Notably, direct mechanical influences contribute to the pathogenesis, particularly in early-onset patients and instances of localized nerve compression (e.g., the median nerve at the carpal tunnel or the ulnar nerve at the cubital tunnel). Conversely, in late-onset forms, neuroinflammatory and neurotoxic effects attributed to TTR aggregates play a pivotal role, as substantiated by in vitro studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128">128</xref>].</p>
<p id="Par75">Therapeutic strategies revolve around reducing the synthesis of mutant TTR, enhancing its stability to prevent misfolding and deposition, eliminating already deposited amyloid fibrils, or altering the defective gene entirely. A significant milestone in the management of hATTR was the advent of liver transplantation, which was first successfully performed in 1990. Subsequently, numerous patients have undergone this procedure, resulting in disease stabilization in many cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">129</xref>].</p>

<title>Dystrophinopathies</title>
<p id="Par82">Dystrophinopathies are a spectrum of X-linked neuromuscular conditions caused by pathogenic variants in the <italic>DMD</italic> gene. This encodes for dystrophin, a protein with a structural role anchoring the actin cytoskeleton to the sarcolemma along with other proteins that together form the dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAPC). Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) constitutes the most severe end of the spectrum, while Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD is a milder disease form with later onset and slower progression. Moreover, mutations in the <italic>DMD</italic> gene occasionally cause isolated X-linked cardiomyopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR146">146</xref>] or may manifest in symptomatic female carriers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR147">147</xref>]. DMD is the most common form of muscular dystrophy affecting around 20 per 100.000 live male births, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR148">148</xref>] while the prevalence of BMD is fewer than 8 cases per 100.000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR149">149</xref>]. The primary effect caused by the lack of the dystrophin protein in skeletal and cardiac muscles is progressive muscle degeneration and necrosis, which is reflected in the changes observed on muscle histology. Disruption or disassembly of the DAPC results in a cascade of consequences that profoundly impact muscle cell functionality and are likely to act in parallel to generate muscle damage. These comprise susceptibility to muscle stress, NOS-dependent functional ischemia, increased reactive oxygen species production (ROS), calcium overload, mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, fibrosis, and inability to properly regenerate muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR150">150</xref>].</p>
<p id="Par83">Despite the early appearance of muscle weakness, affected boys can slowly acquire new motor skills up to the age of 7 years. Afterwards, the disease displays a progressive weakening of skeletal, respiratory, and cardiac muscles. In the absence of treatment, loss of ambulation (LoA) occurs by a median age of 10–12 years in “typical” DMD boys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR151">151</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR154">154</xref>]. Thanks to the development of guidelines for care and management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR155">155</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR157">157</xref>], the early initiation of corticosteroids (CS) treatment, and the optimal management of cardiopulmonary function, patients with DMD can now survive beyond their forties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR158">158</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR161">161</xref>]. However, premature death may still occur during adolescence or early adulthood due to cardiac failure, fatal arrythmias, respiratory failure, and fractures-induced fat emboli. With the improvement of respiratory care, cardiac failure remains the leading cause of mortality in the older patients. At present there is no curative treatment for the disease. Dystrophinopathies are caused by a wide array of different type of mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR162">162</xref>]. Deletions are the most common molecular defect (68–77%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR163">163</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR164">164</xref>], followed by point mutations, duplications (11–13%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR163">163</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR166">166</xref>], and small rearrangements. While there is no clear correlation between the size of the deletion and the resultant clinical phenotype, the DMD vs BMD form can largely be predicted based on the <italic>“reading frame rule”</italic>: a severe, DMD phenotype is associated in ~ 90% of cases with out-of-frame pathogenic variants that induce a frameshift in the protein-coding sequence resulting in unstable RNA and subsequent nearly complete absence of dystrophin expression in muscles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR163">163</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR167">167</xref>]. By contrast, the presence of residual, smaller but functional dystrophin proteins resulting from in-frame deletions or duplications located in the middle of the gene and containing crucial domains can partially rescue the phenotype, hence being associated with BMD. The understanding of the genetic of Dystrophinopathies posed the basis for the development of several therapeutic strategies.</p>
<sec id="Sec29">
<title>Gene therapies</title>
<p id="Par84">Although the prospect of a non-mutation-specific therapy is intriguing, the large size of the <italic>DMD</italic> gene represents a major obstacle for currently used viral vectors, such as AAV (loading capacity &lt; 4.7Kb) and lentiviruses (loading capacity up &lt; 10kb). To overcome such limitations, different companies and labs developed micro or mini-dystrophins, which are truncated dystrophins lacking at least part of the central rod but designed to keep essential domains such as N-Term and Cysteine rich domain. A key point is that the large central rod domain is particularly resilient to large in-frame deletions, as demonstrated by mildly-affected patients harboring large in-frame deletions affecting up to 46% of the coding sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR168">168</xref>]. The deeper understanding of the structure and role of dystrophin itself (e.g., nitric oxide and microtubule binding, protein stability etc.) helped implement the quality of these products, which are currently under investigation in Phase I/II trials. AAV serotypes 1, 6, 8, 9, rh10, and rh74 were found to have tropism for skeletal muscle and heart. FDA recently approved the first systemically delivered, AAVrh74-mediated delivery of a 138kDa micro-dystrophin in pediatric patients with 4 to 5 years of age. The main side effects of AAV gene therapy are linked to immunogenicity. Of note, these were not limited to the immune response generally expected in patients receiving AAV treatment (e.g., elevation of liver enzymes). Serious, T-cell mediated reactions observed in 5 patients treated with different micro-dystrophin constructs and vectors (<italic>i.e.,</italic> AAV9 and AAV rh74) suggest that the presence of mutations excluding exons coding for Hinge 1, (considered essential for the correct localization of dystrophin to the sarcolemma) and the first spectrin-like repeat domains, which are present in all the constructs but missing in these patients, likely provoked immune reactions against these nonself epitopes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR169">169</xref>]. Following these observations, inclusion criteria for trials were amended. Additional concerns related to gene therapy are related to a) the ability of dystrophin constructs that are smaller than those observed in mild BMD cases and lack specific subdomains to fully fulfil their biomolecular role, b) the ability to transfect cardiac myocytes, c) the dilution in time of the product due to the limited efficacy of AAV vectors to target the stem cells reservoir [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR170">170</xref>].</p>

<p id="Par85">Exon-skipping is a therapeutic strategy that employs ASO to induce alternative splicing, thereby bypassing mutated exons.

It has been estimated that exon skipping approaches might be applicable to 55% of DMD-causing mutations and 80% of DMD-causing deletions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR171">171</xref>]. Various exon-skipping products have been developed, including 2′-O-methyl-modified RNA, phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMO), and tricycloDNA antisense molecules. PMOs are uncharged compounds that pose challenges for in vitro cell introduction but exhibit high levels of systemic delivery and efficient exon skipping within dystrophic muscle tissue. To enhance cellular uptake, PMOs have been initially improved through conjugation with arginine-rich cell-penetrating peptides, resulting in peptide phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PPMOs). The safety profile of PMOs and PPMOs has generally been favourable. However, despite the appeal and applicability of exon-skipping techniques and the conditional approval of four ASOs, concerns persist regarding their delivery efficiency. Consequently, certain companies have developed PPMOs conjugated with fatty acid binders or specific antibodies (or antibody fragments, Fabs), to further enhance muscle penetration. Furthermore, there is ongoing exploration of multi-exon skipping to treat a broader patient population and ensure that the resultant transcript contains in-phase spectrin repeats. At present, the FDA has conditionally approved exon-skipping products targeting exons 51 (Eteplirsen), 53 (Vitolarsen and Golodirsen), and 45 (Casimersen) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR172">172</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR173">173</xref>].

Treatment is usually started around 4–5 years of age and should be continued even after the loss of ambulation, due to potential beneficial effect on the preservation of upper limbs strength, cardiorespiratory function, and survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR152">152</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR184">184</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR186">186</xref>]. There is strong evidence that CS can delay LoA by 2–4 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR151">151</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR187">187</xref>]. A longer preservation of ambulation also results in later onset of both respiratory insufficiency and severe scoliosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR188">188</xref>]. Despite the beneficial for slowing disease progression, CS treatment is associated with a range of side effects that require careful monitoring and management. Vamolorone is a molecule that has been developed to reduce the burden of CS treatment. While retaining anti-inflammatory properties, this was designed to have fewer side effects compared to traditional CS used in DMD. The molecule showed promising results indicating an improved safety profile in terms of bone and growth-related morbidities and was recently recommended for marketing authorization by the EMA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR189">189</xref>].</p>
<p id="Par90">Considering the instability of the muscle membrane in DMD, an innovative therapeutic approach may involve the utilization of synthetic block copolymers as membrane stabilizing agents. This strategy aims to mitigate muscle damage by directly enhancing the stability of the dystrophin-deficient muscle membrane. Promising preclinical findings are paving the way for clinical trials involving the administration of P188 (NCT03558958).</p>
<p id="Par91">Lastly, the role of Givinostat, a histone deacetylase inhibitor with potential anti-inflammatory activity, is being explored in Phase III trial (NCT02851797) and is being considered for the treatment of BMD.</p>
<p id="Par92">Among products that failed to demonstrate a clinical benefit there are anti-oxidant (Idebenone—Sideros trial), anti-inflammatory molecule targeting the NF-κB pathway (Edasalonexent—PolarisDMD Trial), [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR190">190</xref>] anti-fibrotic monoclonal antibodies (Pamrevlumab—Fibrogen), and the repurposed drug tamoxifen (TAMDMD—NCT03354039). Myostatin inhibitors were thought to be a good candidate given potential to increase muscle bulk and counteract fibrosis. However, all the trials in human failed, possibly due to pre-existing downregulation of myostatin pathways observed in patients affected by neuromuscular disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR191">191</xref>]. Upregulation of utrophin, a structural and functional paralog of dystrophin encoded by the <italic>UTRN</italic> gene that is activated in the absence of dystrophin, has been explored in preclinical models.

<title>Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD)</title>
<p id="Par93">FSHD is one of the most common inherited muscular diseases, with an estimated incidence of 5–12 affected individuals per 100,000 in the population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR192">192</xref>]. Named for its distinctive muscle involvement pattern, FSHD commonly manifests with facial, scapular girdle, and proximal upper limb muscle impairment, marked by noticeable asymmetry. While most patients experience a gradual progression of muscle weakness over time, approximately 20% of patients exhibit a severe, disabling phenotype necessitating wheelchair use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR193">193</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR194">194</xref>]. The inheritance pattern is AD; however, the disease displays incomplete penetrance, and phenotypic variability and severity can be substantial both among family members and within individual patients. This phenotypic and penetrance heterogeneity is linked to genetic and epigenetic factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR195">195</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR197">197</xref>].</p>
<p id="Par94">The pivotal chromosomal locus in the pathogenesis of FSHD is the D4Z4 macrosatellite tandem repeat array situated in the subtelomeric region of the long arm of chromosome 4 (4q35). In the somatic cells of healthy individuals, this region is transcriptionally repressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR198">198</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR199">199</xref>]. Under normal conditions, this region consists of 10 to 100 tandem repeat units, each measuring 3.3 kb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR198">198</xref>]. Each of these repeats contains a retrogene housing the full open reading frame of double homeobox 4 (<italic>DUX4</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR198">198</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR200">200</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR201">201</xref>]. The distal sequence of the D4Z4 region exhibits two sequence variants, denoted as 4qA and 4qB, with the key distinction being the exclusive presence of a polyadenylation signal (PAS) in the 4qA variant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR202">202</xref>]. The pathogenetic mechanism underlying FSHD1, the most common form of the disease, involves a de-repression of the <italic>DUX4</italic> gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR194">194</xref>]. This occurs due to a deletion/contraction of the repeat units within D4Z4, typically ranging from 1 to 9 repeats, in the presence of the permissive 4qA allele [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR198">198</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR199">199</xref>]. The contraction induces a partial loss of methylation within the D4Z4 region, resulting in chromatin relaxation and facilitating the transcription of <italic>DUX4</italic>. The presence of the PAS contributes to maintaining the stability of <italic>DUX4</italic> mRNA and, consequently, its expression in muscle cells. The triggering of <italic>DUX4</italic> expression in experimental settings, either through overexpression or inducible methods, has been shown to induce cytotoxic effects in diverse somatic cell types. However, the principal pathway governing DUX4-induced cytotoxicity remains uncertain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR203">203</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR204">204</xref>]. FSHD2 accounts for approximately 5% of patients with the phenotype and is characterized by the presence of an allele within the normal range of D4Z4 repeat units. However, the de-repression of <italic>DUX4</italic> is facilitated by the presence of mutations in certain chromatin repressor genes, including <italic>SMCHD1</italic> (in 85% of cases), <italic>DNMT3B</italic>, and <italic>LRIF1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR205">205</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR207">207</xref>]. In this intricate context, many factors come into play, including D4Z4 repeat units, DNA methylation, mutations in <italic>SMCHD1</italic>, chromatin remodeling proteins and epigenetic factors, which influence the FSHD phenotype and progression of the disease.</p>
<p id="Par95">Despite significant advancements in understanding the underlying mechanisms of the disease, there are currently no specific therapies for FSHD.

<title>Gene therapy</title>
<p id="Par96">Silencing of DUX4 through a CRISPR technology can be achieved essentially by two approaches: 1) editing (CRISPRe), which utilizes a functional Cas9 to alter the genomic sequence, and 2) inhibition (CRISPRi), which uses an enzymatically inactive “dead” Cas9 (dCas9) fused to a transcriptional or chromatin repressor. CRISPRi would have advantages on CRISPRe in FSHD, as it does not damage the genome and has limited off target effects being a repressor of regions that we would like to keep silent.</p>
<p id="Par97">Since 2016, a pioneering study showcased the viability of utilizing the CRISPR/dCas9 technology as transcriptional inhibitor to specifically target the Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) zinc finger proteins and other transcriptional repressors at the D4Z4 locus. This approach effectively reduced the transcription of DUX4 in myocytes, offering early evidence of the potential of CRISPR/dCas9 in modulating the expression of key genes implicated in FSHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR208">208</xref>]. Subsequently, further gene editing approaches have been applied in vitro, focusing on inhibiting the transcription of DUX4 exon 3 PAS, although with unsatisfactory results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR209">209</xref>]. The failure of this approach is due to the identification of an additional PAS, located upstream, responsible for the residual DUX4 transcript. Consequently, the subsequent successful steps have been directed towards a multifunctional approach, combining direct targeting of the DUX4 PAS and utilizing the dCas9-KRAB inhibitor to restore the heterochromatin state at the D4Z4 locus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR209">209</xref>]. In an independent investigation, the adenine base editor system was employed alongside Cas9-nickase to instigate an AT to CG conversion within the DUX4 PAS in immortalized myoblasts derived from FSHD1 and FSHD2 patients. This method successfully induced mutations in the PAS, thereby preventing the expression of DUX4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR210">210</xref>]. In a recent study, a novel strategy was employed to target loci within repeats, which posed technical challenges due to the presence of multiple CRISPR–Cas9 binding sites and the potential for generating off-target effects through multiple DNA breaks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR211">211</xref>]. The authors generated and optimized miniaturized cassette to be effectively packed in AAV vectors and to drive a muscle-specific expression of a smaller dCas9 orthologue targeting different epigenetic regulators of DUX4 expression. This innovative approach demonstrated efficacy in reinstating the epigenetic (permanent) repression of DUX4 with minimal impact on neighboring D4Z4 repeats or predicted off-target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR211">211</xref>]. Furthermore, the method successfully achieved DUX4 repression and targeted gene modulation in a FSHD transgenic mouse model, albeit with a modest effect. In conclusion, while gene therapy holds promise for addressing the molecular intricacies of FSHD and has shown encouraging preclinical results, extensive research is essential to overcome delivery challenges, improve targeting specificity, and optimize treatment efficacy before its widespread clinical application.</p>

<p id="Par98">Several recent studies have demonstrated the potential therapeutic application of ASO in the treatment of FSHD, by reducing the transcription of DUX4 and consequently its expression in muscle tissue. Compared to mice treated with a placebo, those treated with ASO exhibited improvements in muscle histology, reduced fibrosis and inflammation, as well as enhanced motor performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR212">212</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR216">216</xref>]. Similarly, the intramuscular delivery of miR-405 using a AAV vector in mice co-transduced with AAV-DUX4 has proven effective. This method successfully diminished DUX4 protein concentration and mitigated DUX4-induced muscle pathology by directing the DUX4 mRNA transcript towards degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR217">217</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR218">218</xref>]. Oligonucleotides designed to specifically target the antisense sequence at the 5ʹ end of U7 small nuclear RNAs, integral components of the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein complex crucial for the 3ʹ end processing of histone pre-mRNAs, were engineered to selectively interfere with the maturation of DUX4 pre-mRNA. Application of this modified agent resulted in a substantial reduction in DUX4 transcript levels within FSHD muscle cells. An additional advantage of this approach, in comparison to conventional ASOs and RNAi-based therapies, lies in the sustained activity of the redirected small nuclear ribonucleoprotein complex targeting DUX4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR219">219</xref>]. The FORTITUDE trial (NCT05747924), a Phase I/II study, was designed to explore both the safety and the efficacy of AOC 1020. AOC 1020 is an innovative antibody-oligonucleotide conjugate, incorporating a DUX4-targeting siRNA linked to a humanized antibody directed against transferrin receptor 1, optimizing its delivery to muscle tissues. The trial is actively recruiting patients with FSHD1 or FSHD2.</p>
<p id="Par99">A last alternative approach is to block DUX4 recruitment of histone acetyltransferases p300 and CREB binding proteins to its target foci to avoid gene expression and DUX4-downstream cascade. This can be reached with p300 specific inhibitors (small molecules) or decoy DUX4 binding sites, which sequester endogenous DUX4 and prevent it from binding to and activating its target genes.</p>

Eighty patients were therefore enrolled in the placebo-controlled REDUX4 phase 2b trial (NCT04003974). Losmapimod, a p38 inhibitor, was administered orally for 48 weeks.

<title>Limb girdle muscular dystrophies (LGMD)</title>
<p id="Par101">Recognized in 1954 as a separate entity, LGMD identifies patients showing onset of muscular dystrophy within the third decade of life, with weakness and atrophy predominantly in the proximal muscles at four limbs, sparing of facial muscles, and progressive course. The disease can be inherited as AD or AR, and the number of genes involved has been progressively raised until the number of 39, while a recent ENMC workshop revised this classification and the nomenclature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR228">228</xref>]. To be considered a form of LGMD the condition must be described in at least two unrelated families with affected individuals achieving independent walking, elevated serum creatine kinase (CK), showing degenerative changes on muscle imaging, and have dystrophic changes on muscle histology. Albeit a similar clinical phenotype, LGMDs do not share a common pathological mechanism that would distinguish them from other forms of muscular dystrophy. Moreover, while some genes encode for proteins involved in the transmembrane connection of the muscle cytoskeleton to extracellular matrix, other have completely different molecular mechanism thus impeding at present a common unifying therapeutic strategy. The most frequent forms are related to mutations in gene <italic>CAPN</italic>, <italic>DYSF, ANO5</italic> and <italic>FKRP</italic>, while in pediatric patients are mainly involved genes causing sarcoglycanopathies, dystroglycanopathies, calpainopathies.</p>

<title>Congenital muscular dystrophies (CMDs)</title>
<p id="Par109">CMDs comprise a heterogeneous group of genetic disorders primarily affecting the skeletal muscle and often associated with multisystem features [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR254">254</xref>]. The clinical picture is characterized by hypotonia and muscle weakness leading to a delay or arrest in the attainment of gross motor milestones; symptoms occur before the achievement of independent ambulation. Such definition provides a pragmatic boundary with LGMD, with many genes that are allelic for both conditions. The severity of muscle involvement is variable, but muscle biopsy usually displays dystrophic features and CK are more commonly elevated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR255">255</xref>]. A classification of CMDs based on the localization of the protein defects defines a) CMDs related to defective structural proteins of the basal membrane or extracellular matrix (ECM), b) CMDs related to primary defects in dystroglycan (DG) or α-dystroglycan glycosylation, c) CMD related to defects in proteins of the edoplasmic reticulum (ER), d) CMDs related to defects in proteins of the nuclear envelope, and e) a wider group including newly recognized forms associated with proteins implicated in ER—Golgi trafficking, disorders affecting mitochondrial and lysosomal morphology and function, and muscular dystrophies with multisystem involvement and neurodegeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR256">256</xref>]. With more than 35 genes identified so far, the overall prevalence of CMDs is 0.6–0.9 per 100.000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR257">257</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR259">259</xref>]. The most common forms are dystroglycanopathies (DGP; 12–25%), Collagen 6 related disorders (COL6-RD) (12–19%), laminin-alpha 2 related dystrophies (LAMA2-RD; 10–37%), and selenoprotein N related myopathy (SEPN1-RM; 11.65%).

<title>Gene therapies</title>
<p id="Par111">The replacement of a defective gene is seen as the optimal strategy for many AR disorders. In CMDs however, this is not always feasible due to the large size of genes exceeding the loading capacity of currently used AAV vectors (i.e., <italic>LAMA2</italic> and <italic>COL6A3</italic>). Replacement is also not an option when disease mechanism derives from toxic gain of function mutations. At present, there are only two Phase I/II trials evaluating the efficacy of gene therapy in patients harbouring mutations in <italic>FKRP (</italic>causing both DGP and LGMDR9<italic>)</italic>, although these are exclusively recruiting individuals with a LGMD phenotype (NCT05224505 and NCT05230459). In general, dystroglycanopathies pose several challenges to treatment. For instance, while pre-clinical studies suggested that the overexpression of the glycotransferase encoded by <italic>LARGE1</italic> could enhance α-DG glycosylation also when the defect resided in other genes (<italic>POMT1</italic> and <italic>POMGNT1),</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR263">263</xref>], such change was not observed in presence of other genetic defects. Moreover, there are concerns regarding the potential toxic effect of α-DG hyper-glycosylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR264">264</xref>]. Finally, CNS plays a pivotal role in numerous dystroglycanopathies, and the prospect of therapeutic interventions administered post-development yielding a favorable impact on this aspect appears unlikely [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR265">265</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR266">266</xref>].</p>
<p id="Par112">Gene addition is seen as a possible strategy for LAMA2-RD. LAMA2-RD arises from pathogenic variants in the gene encoding the alpha-2 subunit of Laminin-211 (Lm-211), also known as merosin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR267">267</xref>]. In patients with Lm-211 deficiency, upregulated laminin isoforms Lm-411 and Lm-511, sharing beta and gamma chains but with different alpha chains, are insufficient substitutes due to limitations in integrin-binding, poor alpha-DG binding affinity, and lack of the LN domain essential for polymerization. Strategies to overcome these constraints include Miniagrin, enhancing laminin binding to alpha-DG, and LN-domain nidogen-1 (αLNNd), enabling polymerization of alpha LN domain-lacking laminins. Co-expression of these molecules in animal models yielded promising results, restoring basement membrane stability and enhancing muscle function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR268">268</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR271">271</xref>]. Of note, both products can be loaded to AAV vectors, hence raising hope for translation to humans.</p>
<p id="Par113">The upregulation of laminin-alpha1-containing isoform Lm-111, which shares homology with Laminin-alpha2, has also shown potential in rescuing muscle and nerve phenotypes. However, challenges remain, as Lm-111 is only expressed during embryonic life, and gene size constraints limit its use in AAV vectors. Alternatives involve delivering exogenous human recombinant Lm-111 through infusions, with some concerns regarding dosing, biodistribution, and human toxicity. Lastly, another elegant approach is achieving CRISPR-dCas9-mediated upregulation of Lm-111, although feasibility in human remains a concern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR272">272</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR274">274</xref>].</p>

<p id="Par114">The modulation of gene expression through the utilization of ASO or RNAi represents a promising approach for addressing dominant negative and gain-of-function mutations. This approach holds relevance in those severe cases of COL6-RD caused by autosomal dominant mutations that usually locate close to the N-terminal region, including a recurrent deep intronic pathogenic variant in intron 11 of COL6A1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR275">275</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR278">278</xref>]. Since haploinsufficiency does not cause disease, a knock-down of the gene is considered safe.</p>
<p id="Par115">In LMNA-RD, mutant lamins exert a dual negative impact: aberrant nuclear localization and diminished lamin levels. The precise mechanisms through which these abnormalities lead to muscle disease remain incompletely understood. Since most cases arise from toxic gain-of-function mutations, several research groups are actively developing therapeutic approaches to silence these toxic mutants. Such strategies involve siRNA or genome editing techniques, such as CRISPR/Cas9. In theory, a combined approach targeting the silencing or knock-down of abnormal transcripts while simultaneously replacing the defective gene could be employed. However, the optimal threshold of lamin A/C expression remains a subject of investigation, as both excessive and insufficient expression can detrimentally affect muscle cells.</p>
<p id="Par116">Lastly, in the case of FCMD, a remarkable 80% of Japanese patients share a distinctive founder mutation that disrupts mRNA splicing, resulting in an aberrant protein with atypical amino acid composition at the C-terminus. This leads to abnormal protein localization from the Golgi apparatus to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Given the nature of this genetic defect, ASOs designed to target splicing modulating regions hold promise as a mutation-specific therapeutic strategy for FCMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR279">279</xref>].</p>

<title>Other strategies</title>
<p id="Par117">Investigational products aimed at common pathogenic pathways hold the theoretical advantage of their applicability in more than one condition. Based on pre-clinical data suggesting a role of proapoptotic pathways in the generation of damage in LAMA2-RD and a beneficial effect observed in mice after the administration of the inhibitor of the Siah1-mediated nuclear translocation of GAPDH (named Omigapil), a 12-weeks, phase 1 clinical trial was completed in 2019 (NCT01805024) on patients affected by LAMA2-RD and COL6-RD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR267">267</xref>]. While the compound was safe and well-tolerated, follow-up was too short to provide information regarding its efficacy. The development of the product in CMD was however discontinued.</p>
<p id="Par118">A recently discovered important stage in the synthesis of the ligand-binding section of α-DG involves the addition of a tandem ribitol 5-phosphate (Rbo5P) structure to the sugar chain of α-DG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR280">280</xref>]. This process is facilitated by ISPD and two Rbo5P transferases. The use of ribitol has demonstrated benefits in preclinical models and could potentially serve as a therapeutic avenue for patients carrying pathogenic variants in <italic>ISPD</italic>, <italic>FKTN</italic>, and <italic>FKRP</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR266">266</xref>].

<title>Myotonic dystrophies</title>
<p id="Par120">This is a dominant inherited, multi-systemic, disease due to the expansion of the CTG triplet repeat in the <italic>DMPK</italic> gene for type 1 myotonic dystrophy (DM1) and the CCTG-tetranucleotide sequence in the <italic>CNBP</italic> gene for the DM2. DM1 is characterized by weakness in facial and distal limb muscles plus myotonia, while DM2 mainly affects proximal limb muscles and myotonia is often less evident. DM1, and in general with lower frequency and severity in DM2, also can present with non-muscular signs and symptoms including cognitive impairment, cataract, insulin resistance, infertility and endocrine dysfunction, cardiac arrhythmia, sleep disorders and hypersomnia, and dysphagia. While DM1 onset can be at any age, including neonatal and infancy (more severe forms), DM2 onset is only in adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR281">281</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR282">282</xref>].</p>
<p id="Par121">In both cases, the gene expansion has deleterious downstream effects in many different cells of the body, thus explaining the multi-organ disease. This mechanism is clear and well documented for DM1, while it is still not completely understood for DM2. In DM1, the production of an abnormal RNA (CUG repeats of abnormal <italic>DMPK</italic> transcripts) accumulates in the nucleus (RNA foci) and disrupts normal cellular function with a gain-of-function mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR283">283</xref>]. RNA foci dysregulate essential proteins, such as Muscleblind-like 1 and 2 (MBNL1/2) factors and CUGBP Elav-Like Family Member 1 (CUGBP1 or CELF1). The dysregulation of MBNL1/2 and CELF1 is responsible for the spliceopathy, that is the changes in the alternative splicing of hundreds of genes thus explaining the multisystemic characteristic of DM1 symptoms. Accordingly, animal models with long CTG repeat expansions replicate the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR284">284</xref>]. Recently, miRNA dysregulation was suggested to contribute to MBNL1/2 protein depletion, as well as the dysregulation of other signaling pathways such as AKT, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR285">285</xref>].</p>
<p id="Par122">At present, the only treatments available for DM1 and DM2 are related to prevent myotonia with anti-epileptic drugs or the more effective mexiletine, an antiarrhythmic molecule blocking sodium channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR286">286</xref>]. This molecule is currently used in clinical practice as was shown to significantly reduce the frequency and severity of myotonia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR287">287</xref>], but did not provide benefit in 6-min walk distance after 6 months of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR288">288</xref>]. Mexiletine has also shown the ability to downregulate <italic>DMPK</italic> mRNA levels, suggesting additional function in DM1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR289">289</xref>]. Although the use of Modafinil to treat hypersomnia in DM1 patients was not found to be effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR290">290</xref>], there is general consensus between experts suggesting that this drug can be useful in selected patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR291">291</xref>]. Other available treatments are related to the development of specific symptoms in the different target organs, and thus aimed at controlling cardiac, endocrine (e.g., hyperglycemia), and gastrointestinal manifestations.</p>
<p id="Par123">Drugs directed against the pathogenesis of the disease are under development. A few different approaches have been developed to excise, block the expression, or modify the instability of CTG repeats with the intent to specifically target the mutant allele, its RNA product, or its downstream signaling pathways.</p>
<sec id="Sec47">
<title>Gene therapies</title>
<p id="Par124">Gene editing is the mechanism of choice to target and delete the expanded (toxic) repeats. The advantage of this approach is that the DM1 mutation can be eliminated from the genomic DNA, preventing the toxic downstream effects. Several nucleases were tested to induce double-strand breaks in in vitro and small animal models showing variable results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR292">292</xref>]. Better results were observed with the CRISPR/Cas9 technology to excise DM1 expansion in mouse models, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR293">293</xref>] or patient-derived myoblasts, fibroblasts or IPS cells; reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR294">294</xref>]. Tissue-specific and time restricted Cas9 activity will constitute a promising tool for reducing the risk of unintended genomic effects still limiting this technology.</p>

<title>Molecular therapies</title>
<p id="Par125">ASOs have been designed with two different aims: (1) to block MBNL1 interaction by binding to CUG repeats or (2) to induce the degradation of CUG-expansion-containing DMPK mRNA, as the stabilization of the repeat to postpone the onset or slow the progression of the disease. Different types of ASO have been tested in human cells or animal models with interesting results in the last years. For example, already in 2011 Nakamori et al. showed that CAG-repeat ASO that bind CUG-expanded RNA was able to suppress the expansion instability in DM1 models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR295">295</xref>]. Many subsequent preclinical studies were performed and have been recently reviewed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR296">296</xref>]. A similar strategy to target CUG expansion was achieved with RNA-i by siRNA or miRNA delivered by viral vectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR297">297</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR298">298</xref>].</p>
<p id="Par126">An alternative way to tackle MBNL1 sequestration is to use an engineered RNA binding domain of the protein itself as a decoy for CUG-expansion to reverse the toxicity of the mutant transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR299">299</xref>].</p>
<p id="Par127">Clinical trials in human have been performed or are ongoing for both ASOs and RNA-interference strategy. Recently, a phase I/IIa trial with the ASO Baliforsen showed that the drug was generally well tolerated but with low efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR300">300</xref>], probably due to low muscle drug concentration, as generally observed for other ASOs in DMD. Even in this case, new strategies to increase ASO concentration in muscles, such as conjugation with specific antibodies, fatty acids or proteins, are under evaluation in clinical studies.</p>

<title>Cellular therapies</title>
<p id="Par128">Cell therapy studies in DM1 are a few. One potential limit might be the observation that donor-derived engrafted cells (nuclei) acquire toxic RNA foci containing MBLN1 sequestration and abnormal alternative splicing. This suggests that toxic CUG repeat-containing RNA may exit the endogenous nucleus and traffic to other nuclei in the syncytial myofiber, thus exerting pathological effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR301">301</xref>].</p>

<sec id="Sec50">
<title>Other strategies</title>
<p id="Par129">Many molecules have been or are being tested for DM1 including new and repurposing drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR302">302</xref>]. Among others, some have reached clinical evaluation and are briefly described below. Metformin, a biguanide antidiabetic drug, was shown to rescue multiple aspects of DM1. Metformin can correct DM1-related alternative splicing defects, alleviates muscle cell senescence and mitochondrial dysfunction, reduces the risk of developing cancer and improves mobility in DM1 treated patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR302">302</xref>]. A phase II clinical trial showed the efficacy of metformin on mobility in 40 patients with DM1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR298">298</xref>], while a larger study is on-going. Erithromycin, as the prototype of small molecules to inhibit the interaction between MBNL1 and CUG expansions has been successfully used in vitro and in mouse models of DM1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR303">303</xref>]. A clinical study in DM1 patients is ongoing. Preclinical studies with GSK3β inhibitors, such as lithium and Tideglusib gave positive results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR304">304</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR305">305</xref>].

<title>Congenital myopathies (CM)</title>
<p id="Par130">CM are a heterogeneous group of genetic disorders usually characterized by congenital hypotonia and weakness that typically exhibit stable or slowly progressive clinical course. Of note, the clinical spectrum ranges from milder forms (mainly with childhood but also adult onset) to severe neonatal cases, with involvement of skeletal, extraocular, respiratory, and bulbar muscles leading to severe disability and early death. Cardiac involvement is observed only in patients harbouring mutations in specific genes (e.g., <italic>TTN, MYH7</italic>). CMs have been historically defined by the histopathological findings described on muscle biopsy. The most common categories are (a) congenital myopathies with cores (central core or multi-minicore), (b) nemaline myopathies (defined by the presence of distinct rod-like inclusions called nemaline bodies), (c) and centronuclear myopathies. Historical classifications also included Congenital fibre type disproportion and Myosin storage myopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR307">307</xref>]. Collectively, CM have a prevalence of 1:26.000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR308">308</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR309">309</xref>] and up to 30 causative genes identified so far. Importantly, not only mutations in different genes can cause the same muscle pathologies, but mutations within the same gene can cause different clinical and histopathological findings. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying CMs are mainly related to excitation–contraction coupling, intracellular calcium homeostasis, membrane trafficking and remodelling, and sarcomeric filament assembly and interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR310">310</xref>]. To date, no approved treatment exists for CMs but there is hope for patients coming from both symptomatic and targeted strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR311">311</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR312">312</xref>].</p>

<p id="Par131">X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM) is a rare monogenic disease due to mutations in the <italic>MTM1</italic> gene that cause centronuclear myopathy. The clinical spectrum is wide including symptomatic female carriers, but 80% of male individuals manifest with a severe clinical phenotype. This presentation is characterized by significant prenatal and neonatal features, including polyhydramnios, reduced foetal motility, neonatal muscular weakness, hypotonia, and respiratory insufficiency. Motor developmental milestones are markedly delayed, and most affected individuals do not attain independent ambulation. Weakness often involving facial and extraocular muscles is severe. Respiratory compromise is nearly universal, with the majority of affected individuals necessitating continuous ventilatory support. Based on successful preclinical studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR313">313</xref>], a phase I/II open-label, ascending-dose study was performed to evaluate AT132, an AAV8-delivered gene therapy (NCT03199469). While preliminary data suggested potential clinical benefit on both motor and respiratory function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR314">314</xref>], the study was halted for the death of 4 patients with ongoing severe cholestatic liver dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR311">311</xref>].

<p id="Par132">Within the group of centronuclear myopathies, <italic>MTM1, DNM2</italic> and <italic>BIN1</italic> are interconnected due to the role they play in membrane trafficking. Preclinical studies showed that the downregulation of DNM2, whose levels are increased also in BIN1 and MTM1-related centronuclear myopathies, resulted in clinical and histological improvements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR311">311</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR316">316</xref>]. Based on these findings, a phase I/II, dose escalation trial testing the molecule DYN101 (an ASO directed against human DNM2 RNA), was performed on patients affected by XLMTM and DNM2 centronuclear myopathies. However, the trial was stopped due to safety issues. Alternative strategies (such as AAV-delivered shRNA or CRISPR/Cas) have been explored in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR317">317</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR318">318</xref>]. An further approach that prompted positive results in murine models of <italic>MTM1</italic> and <italic>DNM2</italic> related CM was the upregulation of amphiphysin 2 (encoded by <italic>BIN1</italic>), which is a negative regulator of <italic>DNM2</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR319">319</xref>].</p>

<p id="Par133">Another therapeutic strategy with potential benefit on multiple conditions is the use of a repurposed drug called Tamoxifen. Its beneficial effect on muscle function was demonstrated in preclinical models of BIN1, DNM2 and MTM1 related centronuclear myopathies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR320">320</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR321">321</xref>].

<p id="Par134">RYR1-related myopathies, allelic to the malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS) trait, are caused by both autosomal dominant (milder) and recessive forms. Mutants in <italic>RYR1</italic>, encoding for the type 1 ryanodine receptor (an intracellular calcium release channel), cause abnormal sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium leak and increased activity of calcium-activated proteases. Hence, molecules aimed at stabilizing have been tested in preclinical models, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR322">322</xref>] and in a Phase 1 clinical trial (NCT04141670). On the other hand, the use of the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine failed to meet primary endpoints in a trial conducted on patients harbouring <italic>RYR1</italic> mutants (NCT02362425). Results on patients affected by <italic>SEPN1</italic> related myopathies (which span from multi-minicore CM to rigid spine CMD) are still pending (NCT NCT02505087).</p>
<p id="Par135">Lastly, there is evidence that in some patients with confirmed CM a transmission defects in the neuromuscular junction can be present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR323">323</xref>]. Interestingly, whilst CM and CMS are distinct groups of disorders, there are in some cases overlapping clinical features, such as fatigable muscle weakness. Features suggestive of NMJ abnormalities include, alone or in combination, positive response to AChE inhibitors, abnormal repetitive nerve stimulation and increased jitter on single fibre electromyography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR324">324</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR328">328</xref>]. Of note, long term anti-cholinesterase treatment has been shown to detrimentally affect end-plate structures and neuromuscular transmission; in CMS patients harbouring AChR mutants the initial beneficial treatment effects of AChE inhibitors can diminish over time. The addition of β2-adrenergic agonists to anti-cholinesterase treatment has been shown to rescue the loss of postsynaptic folding caused by long-term pyridostigmine treatment in AChR deficient mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR144">144</xref>]. Beneficial effects of a combinatory treatment, whether linked to the above mechanism or to the anabolic effects exerted by β2-adrenergic agonists, have been demonstrated in CMS patients with AChR deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR329">329</xref>]<italic>,</italic> and in anecdotical CM cases, even in the absence of clear neurophysiology abnormalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR326">326</xref>].</p>

<title>Summary and conclusions</title>
<p id="Par136">Although significant therapeutic results in neuromuscular disorders are still limited to SMA and hATTR neuropathies, a relevant number of molecules and products are under evaluation in preclinical and clinical studies for the whole spectrum of genetic neuromuscular disorders. The paradigm that genetic disorders are untreatable conditions has therefore dramatically changed, suggesting that in few years we will likely have numerous drugs available for various forms of inherited neuromuscular diseases. However, several issues persist. The efficient delivery of products to the precise cell compartment, including effective targeting of stem cells, still presents significant challenges. Moreover, it’s important to note that gene transfer might not always be feasible, particularly for extremely large genes, when utilizing AAV vectors due to the limited cargo capacity of this vector. Finally, advanced tools such as gene editing still maintain off-target toxic effects that limit their application.</p>
