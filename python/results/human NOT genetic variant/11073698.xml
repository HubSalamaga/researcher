      <title>Introduction</title>
      <sec id="sec006">
        <title>Description of the condition</title>
        <p>Post-stroke depression (PSD) is a post-stroke syndrome characterized by mood disorders, loss of interest, anorexia, insomnia, and slowness of thinking in addition to the symptoms of stroke, and is usually accompanied by corresponding physical symptoms, and in severe cases, it may lead to fantasies, misanthropy, and suicidality [<xref rid="pone.0300769.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0300769.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. More than one-third of stroke survivors have been reported to suffer from the disease, with a cumulative incidence of 39%-52% within 5 years of stroke attack, and approximately 57% of patients recovering from PSD within one year [<xref rid="pone.0300769.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0300769.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The psychosocial vulnerability model suggests that depressive symptoms in stroke survivors are mainly attributed to decreased engagement in daily activities during the recovery process [<xref rid="pone.0300769.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Previous studies have indicated that PSD may stem from psychological stress responses triggered by post-stroke cognitive dysfunction, physical disability, or social isolation [<xref rid="pone.0300769.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These patients face the risks of poor recovery of neurological function, increased disability and mortality rates, slow recovery and decreased quality of life, which seriously affects their recovery and quality of life, and creates additional burdens on their families and society [<xref rid="pone.0300769.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The treatment of PSD remains extremely challenging due to its complex pathogenesis. Therefore, targeted interventions for PSD should be implemented in order to improve the progression of the patient&#x2019;s condition.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec007">
        <title>Description and function of intervention</title>
        <p>Currently, oral antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitors (NDRIs) are commonly used clinically for the treatment of PSD, and their efficacy and safety remain controversial, with consideration of the patient&#x2019;s underlying medical condition, compliance, and adverse reactions to antidepressant medications, and the effectiveness of the clinical treatments is often more difficult to assess. In contrast, acupuncture, known as a &#x2019;green therapy,&#x2019; has been proven effective and safe in treating PSD [<xref rid="pone.0300769.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p>
        <p>Acupuncture (AC), which is a being a minimally invasive technique, has been widely used in China and worldwide to improve the clinical symptoms and progression of various diseases, such as trigeminal neuralgia [<xref rid="pone.0300769.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], migraine [<xref rid="pone.0300769.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], essential hypertension [<xref rid="pone.0300769.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], endometriosis-related pain [<xref rid="pone.0300769.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and male infertility [<xref rid="pone.0300769.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In recent years, numerous studies have demonstrated the definite curative effect of acupuncture on PSD [<xref rid="pone.0300769.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0300769.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Acupuncture can exchange information between immune-neurological-endocrine-microbial metabolism through the brain-intestinal axis, further balancing the structure of intestinal flora, maintaining intestinal homeostasis, improving the dysfunction of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, and inhibiting inflammatory responses, thus improving the symptoms of PSD patients [<xref rid="pone.0300769.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec008">
        <title>Why it is important to do this review</title>
        <p>Acupuncture utilizes the advantages of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) syndrome differentiation and treatment, while also reducing the side effects of Western medicine. It can improve patients&#x2019; negative mood, alleviate somatic symptoms, and promote neurological function recovery. Numerous randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses have consistently demonstrated the specific benefits of acupuncture treatment for patients with PSD [<xref rid="pone.0300769.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0300769.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Despite the increasing use of acupuncture in PSD, there is still an absence of rigorously designed systematic reviews and meta-analyses to assess its efficacy and potential harms [<xref rid="pone.0300769.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Hence, our objective is to conduct a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of the existing literature to investigate the role of acupuncture in treating PSD and its potential benefits or risks for patients. The findings of this study aim to address the ongoing controversy surrounding the benefits or harms of acupuncture in patients with PSD and provide conclusive evidence for clinical decision-making.</p>

          <p>The process of selecting studies, encompassing screening of literature, extraction and management of data, as well as examination, will be carried out by two researchers. They will independently assess the titles, abstracts, and keywords of all retrieved studies, identifying the trials that fulfill the inclusion criteria. For further evaluation, the complete texts of all potentially relevant studies will be acquired. In case of any disagreements, the two researchers will engage in discussion with the involvement of the third author.

          <p>The risk of bias in all the studies included will be assessed using the Cochrane Handbook. The evaluation and description of risks will be based on the following 6 items: generation of random sequences, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting, and other biases. Risk levels will be categorized into three: "low risk of bias", "high risk of bias", and "unclear risk of bias".</p>

        <title>Data synthesis</title>
        <p>We will utilize RevMan 5.4 statistical software for data integration and Meta analysis. Funnel plots and EGGER tests will be created using the R language. Dichotomous variables will be expressed using relative risk (RR), while continuous variables will be expressed using mean difference (MD). If different measurement tools are used for the same variable, standardized mean difference (SMD) will be used for analysis. The interval estimate will be expressed as a 95% confidence interval (CI). The fixed effect model (FEM) will be used when the homogeneity between studies is good (P &#x2265; 0.1, I<sup>2</sup> &#x2264; 50%). In cases where there is significant heterogeneity between studies, we will analyze the reasons and conduct subgroup analysis or sensitivity analysis by eliminating literature and using other methods. If the heterogeneity remains high (P&lt;0.1, I<sup>2</sup>&gt;50%), the random effects model (REM) will be selected. For studies that are not suitable for meta-analysis, qualitative analysis will be used. P&lt;0.05 means the difference is statistically significant.</p>

        <title>Sensitivity analysis</title>
        <p>In order to validate the stability of the initial findings in the context of high heterogeneity, sensitivity analyses will be performed on the following different items: type of study, age difference, gender difference, study quality, treatment duration, treatment frequency and quality of heterogeneity. Reassessment of other relevant factors such as potential risk of bias, methodological quality and missing data will also be included.</p>

The evaluation scale encompasses four levels, namely high, moderate, low, and very low. Classification criteria: high (no evidence of downgrade), moderate (1 evidence of downgrade), low (2 evidence of downgrade), very low (more than 2 evidence of downgrade). The total clinical effective rate can be categorized into two levels, namely level 3 and level 4, based on the efficacy evaluation standards. Level 3 includes cure/markedly effective, effective, and ineffective outcomes, while level 4 includes cure, markedly effective, effective, and ineffective outcomes.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>PSD, defined as post-stroke depressive condition, is the most common psychiatric problem following stroke, which reduces patients&#x2019; quality of life and ability to recover [<xref rid="pone.0300769.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. TCM believes that PSD is an emotional disease that occurs on the basis of stroke due to a variety of reasons that lead to emotional disorders, which always belongs to the category of &#x2019;depression due to illness&#x2019;. After a stroke, patients&#x2019; motor function of the limbs, language and thinking ability and cognitive function will be damaged to varying degrees, which results in the gradual decline of the patients&#x2019; ability to take care of themselves in their daily life and their ability to socialize, as well as the marginalization of society. As a result, the patient&#x2019;s self-care ability in daily life, social ability and social marginalization are gradually reduced, leading to symptoms such as being sentimental, having a bad mood, being depressed, and being lazy and less active. The American Heart Association recommends that antidepressants be administered to PSD patients and continued for at least 6 months after recovery [<xref rid="pone.0300769.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, studies have indicated that long-term use of SSRI antidepressants may increase the risk of stroke and myocardial infarction and is associated with increased all-cause mortality [<xref rid="pone.0300769.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a &#x2019;green treatment&#x2019; to help patients reduce the adverse effects of antidepressants and improve neurological dysfunction, thereby alleviating medical stress.</p>
      <p>Acupuncture as a uniquely holistic approach to treatment, with the ability to tailor the acupoint protocol to the patient&#x2019;s specific symptoms, may make acupuncture a uniquely supportive therapy for many stroke patients and may influence clinical decision-making regarding the use of acupuncture in post-stroke patients [<xref rid="pone.0300769.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In recent years, acupuncture has been increasingly used in post-stroke care, with wrist-ankle acupuncture (WAA) improving the antidepressant effect of fluoxetine and reducing neurologic and gastrointestinal adverse drug reactions, and the combination of which is more effective in treating PSD [<xref rid="pone.0300769.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Shao-Hua Zhang and colleagues have also demonstrated the effectiveness of acupuncture in treating PSD and alleviating patient symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0300769.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, due to insufficient evidence to support these claims, results of clinical studies on the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture in treating patients with PSD have been inconsistent. This leads to the question of whether acupuncture can be used to treat PSD, and when and how to make it more effective. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for the treatment of patients with PSD through systematic reviews and meta-analysis, in order to provide a basis for clinical evidence-based medical decision-making.</p>

<bold>Comments to the Author</bold>
</p>
      <p>1. Does the manuscript provide a valid rationale for the proposed study, with clearly identified and justified research questions?</p>
      <p>The research question outlined is expected to address a valid academic problem or topic and contribute to the base of knowledge in the field.<!-- </font> --></p>

      <p>Reviewer #2:&#xA0;Partly</p>
      <p>**********</p>
      <p><!-- <font color="black"> -->2. Is the protocol technically sound and planned in a manner that will lead to a meaningful outcome and allow testing the stated hypotheses?</p>
      <p>The manuscript should describe the methods in sufficient detail to prevent undisclosed flexibility in the experimental procedure or analysis pipeline, including sufficient outcome-neutral conditions (e.g. necessary controls, absence of floor or ceiling effects) to test the proposed hypotheses and a statistical power analysis where applicable. As there may be aspects of the methodology and analysis which can only be refined once the work is undertaken, authors should outline potential assumptions and explicitly describe what aspects of the proposed analyses, if any, are exploratory.<!-- </font> --></p>
      <p>Reviewer #1:&#xA0;No</p>
      <p>Reviewer #2:&#xA0;Yes</p>
      <p>**********</p>
      <p><!-- <font color="black"> -->3. Is the methodology feasible and described in sufficient detail to allow the work to be replicable?</p>
      <p>Descriptions of methods and materials in the protocol should be reported in sufficient detail for another researcher to reproduce all experiments and analyses. The protocol should describe the appropriate controls, sample size calculations, and replication needed to ensure that the data are robust and reproducible.<!-- </font> --></p>
      <p>Reviewer #1:&#xA0;Yes</p>

      <p><!-- <font color="black"> -->4. Have the authors described where all data underlying the findings will be made available when the study is complete?</p>
      <p>The <ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/materials-and-software-sharing" ext-link-type="uri">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception, at the time of publication. The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data&#x2014;e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party&#x2014;those must be specified.<!-- </font> --></p>

      <p>PLOS ONE does not copyedit accepted manuscripts, so the language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous. Any typographical or grammatical errors should be corrected at revision, so please note any specific errors here.<!-- </font> --></p>

      <p>Reviewer #1:&#xA0;1. This study failed to state why it is important to do this review. Several meta-analyses/protocols of meta-analysis have been published in recent years. However, there is no effective comparison between the previous meta-analysis and this one in the background or discussion.</p>
      <p>2. The author needs to improve the English expression and grammar of the full text.</p>
      <p>3. The total effective rate of AC to treat PSD was selected as the primary outcome in this study, but the author failed to state the definition of effective.</p>
      <p>4. The protocol of data synthesis and Sensitivity analysis needs to be more detailed.</p>
      <p>Reviewer #2:&#xA0;The manuscript, presenting a research protocol for a meta-analysis on the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture therapy in treating post-stroke depression, appears to be of good quality. The topic chosen is of considerable clinical significance. Although the initial quality of the manuscript is commendable, there are areas where further refinement could enhance its scientific rigor and clarity. Detailed observations and suggestions are provided below to assist in these potential improvements.</p>
      <p>1. Innovativeness</p>
      <p>Your manuscript mentions previous similar meta-analyses and describes their limitations. This is a good starting point. To strengthen the innovativeness of your manuscript, it is suggested to more elaborately detail how this study makes innovative contributions on this basis, and the importance of these innovations in the current field of research.</p>
      <p>2. Structure of the Abstract</p>
      <p>The abstract is a crucial part of the paper, aiming to concisely and clearly highlight the main points of the research. Regarding the background section, it is advised to streamline the current expression, retaining only information directly relevant to the research, to enhance the clarity and efficiency of the abstract.</p>
      <p>3. Tense Issues</p>
      <p>In lines 173 to 175, you refer to the characteristics of this study as a protocol. Regarding the use of tense, it is recommended to review and adjust to ensure consistency and accuracy in the text when describing the research design, methods, and expected outcomes.</p>
      <p>4. Choice of SMD</p>
      <p>When choosing the Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) as the measure of effect size, please provide a more detailed explanation as to why the Mean Difference (MD) is not applicable in this study.</p>

      <p>Reply: Changes have been made.</p>
      <p>Reviewer #1:&#xA0;</p>
      <p>1)This study failed to state why it is important to do this review. Several meta-analyses/protocols of meta-analysis have been published in recent years. However, there is no effective comparison between the previous meta-analysis and this one in the background or discussion.</p>
      <p>Reply: Currently, oral antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitors (NDRIs) are commonly used in clinical practice. However, the effectiveness and safety of treating post-stroke depression (PSD) using these antidepressants are still controversial. It is important to consider the patient's underlying condition, compliance, and potential adverse reactions to antidepressant drugs. Evaluating the clinical treatment effect can be challenging. Long-term use of SSRI antidepressants has been associated with an increased risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, and all-cause mortality. In contrast, acupuncture, known as a 'green therapy,' has been proven effective and safe in treating PSD. Acupuncture utilizes the advantages of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) syndrome differentiation and treatment, while also reducing the side effects of Western medicine. It can improve patients' negative mood, alleviate somatic symptoms, and promote neurological function recovery. Therefore, studying the effectiveness of acupuncture treatment for PSD is of great significance, and the significance of the study is explained in the revised manuscript.</p>
      <p>2)The author needs to improve the English expression and grammar of the full text.</p>
      <p>Reply: Thanks for your suggestion. We have tried our best to polish the language in the revised manuscript. These changes will not influence the content and framework of the paper.</p>
      <p>3)The total effective rate of AC to treat PSD was selected as the primary outcome in this study, but the author failed to state the definition of effective.</p>
      <p>Reply: As suggested by the reviewer, we have added a definition of total effective rate in the Type of outcome measures section and highlighted it in red text.</p>
      <p>4)The protocol of data synthesis and Sensitivity analysis needs to be more detailed.</p>
      <p>Reply: Thanks for your suggestion. Data synthesis and Sensitivity analysis have been described in more detail.</p>
      <p>Reviewer #2:&#xA0;The manuscript, presenting a research protocol for a meta-analysis on the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture therapy in treating post-stroke depression, appears to be of good quality. The topic chosen is of considerable clinical significance. Although the initial quality of the manuscript is commendable, there are areas where further refinement could enhance its scientific rigor and clarity. Detailed observations and suggestions are provided below to assist in these potential improvements.</p>
      <p>1) Innovativeness</p>
      <p>Your manuscript mentions previous similar meta-analyses and describes their limitations. This is a good starting point. To strengthen the innovativeness of your manuscript, it is suggested to more elaborately detail how this study makes innovative contributions on this basis, and the importance of these innovations in the current field of research.</p>
      <p>Reply: TCM believes that PSD is an emotional disease that occurs on the basis of stroke due to a variety of reasons that lead to emotional disorders, which always belongs to the category of "depression due to illness". After a stroke, patients' motor function of the limbs, language and thinking ability and cognitive function will be damaged to varying degrees, which results in the gradual decline of the patients' ability to take care of themselves in their daily life and their ability to socialize, as well as the marginalization of society. As a result, the patient's self-care ability in daily life, social ability and social marginalization are gradually reduced, leading to symptoms such as being sentimental, having a bad mood, being depressed, and being lazy and less active. Acupuncture utilizes the advantages of TCM syndrome differentiation and treatment, while also reducing the side effects of Western medicine. It can improve patients' negative mood, alleviate somatic symptoms, and promote neurological function recovery. Therefore, studying the effectiveness of acupuncture treatment for PSD is of great significance, and the significance of the study is explained in the revised manuscript.</p>
      <p>2) Structure of the Abstract</p>
      <p>The abstract is a crucial part of the paper, aiming to concisely and clearly highlight the main points of the research. Regarding the background section, it is advised to streamline the current expression, retaining only information directly relevant to the research, to enhance the clarity and efficiency of the abstract.</p>
      <p>Reply: Thanks for your suggestion. Abstracts have been streamlined to better highlight the main points of the paper's research.</p>
      <p>3) Tense Issues</p>
      <p>In lines 173 to 175, you refer to the characteristics of this study as a protocol. Regarding the use of tense, it is recommended to review and adjust to ensure consistency and accuracy in the text when describing the research design, methods, and expected outcomes.</p>
      <p>Reply: We feel sorry for our carelessness. In our resubmitted manuscript, the tense issues in the subgroup analysis section has been revised. Thanks for your correction.</p>
      <p>4) Choice of SMD</p>
      <p>When choosing the Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) as the measure of effect size, please provide a more detailed explanation as to why the Mean Difference (MD) is not applicable in this study.</p>
      <p>Reply: After gaining an in-depth understanding of the definitions of SMD and MD, we believe that this study should use MD as a measure of effect size. At the same time, it is stated in the revised manuscript that if different measurement tools are used for the same variables, SMD will be used for analysis. Thank you for your correction, which allowed us to make timely adjustments to the statistical methods of the protocol.</p>
      <p>5) Introduction to GRADE</p>
      <p>In lines 188 to 190, the introduction to the GRADE assessment method seems overly brief. To better help readers understand how you have applied this method and its role in your research, please provide a more detailed explanation, including its assessment criteria and how it is applied in this study.</p>
      <p>Reply: Thank you for your suggestion. We have provided a more detailed explanation of the GRADE evaluation method, evaluation criteria, and its application in this study in the revised manuscript.</p>
      <p>We tried our best to improve the manuscript and made some changes in the manuscript.</p>
      <p>We appreciate for Editors and Reviewers' warm work earnestly, and hope that the correction will meet with approval. Once again thank you very much for your comments and suggestions.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely,</p>
      <p>Wei Zou</p>

<bold>Comments to the Author</bold>
</p>
      <p>1. Does the manuscript provide a valid rationale for the proposed study, with clearly identified and justified research questions?</p>
      <p>The research question outlined is expected to address a valid academic problem or topic and contribute to the base of knowledge in the field.<!-- </font> --></p>
      <p>Reviewer #3:&#xA0;Yes</p>
      <p>**********</p>
      <p><!-- <font color="black"> -->2. Is the protocol technically sound and planned in a manner that will lead to a meaningful outcome and allow testing the stated hypotheses?</p>
      <p>The manuscript should describe the methods in sufficient detail to prevent undisclosed flexibility in the experimental procedure or analysis pipeline, including sufficient outcome-neutral conditions (e.g. necessary controls, absence of floor or ceiling effects) to test the proposed hypotheses and a statistical power analysis where applicable. As there may be aspects of the methodology and analysis which can only be refined once the work is undertaken, authors should outline potential assumptions and explicitly describe what aspects of the proposed analyses, if any, are exploratory.<!-- </font> --></p>
      <p>Reviewer #3:&#xA0;Yes</p>
      <p>**********</p>
      <p><!-- <font color="black"> -->3. Is the methodology feasible and described in sufficient detail to allow the work to be replicable?</p>
      <p>Descriptions of methods and materials in the protocol should be reported in sufficient detail for another researcher to reproduce all experiments and analyses. The protocol should describe the appropriate controls, sample size calculations, and replication needed to ensure that the data are robust and reproducible.<!-- </font> --></p>

      <p>The <ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/materials-and-software-sharing" ext-link-type="uri">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception, at the time of publication. The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data&#x2014;e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party&#x2014;those must be specified.<!-- </font> --></p>

      <p>Reviewer #3:&#xA0;The paper discusses the high incidence and low recognition rate of post-stroke depression (PSD), emphasizing its impact on patients&#x2019; mental well-being and the increased risk of stroke recurrence and poor prognosis. It highlights the public health concern posed by PSD. It examines the popularity and inconsistent clinical research results regarding the efficacy and safety of acupuncture as a treatment for PSD. The systematic review aims to gather and critically assess all available evidence on the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture in treating patients with PSD. The authors address the journal&#x2019;s requirements and reviewers&#x2019; comments, making corrections and providing clarifications to improve the manuscript. They emphasize the significance of studying acupuncture for PSD and detail their responses to the editorial and reviewer comments. This section serves as an introduction to the study protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis on acupuncture treatment for PSD. It sets the stage for the detailed methodology and expected outcomes of the review. The manuscript has undergone a thorough review, and the revisions have been commendably executed. I advocate considering this manuscript for publication.</p>
