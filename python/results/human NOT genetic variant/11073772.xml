  <body>
    <p>The organ shortage continues to be one of the major challenges in abdominal transplantation. In the United States, mortality on the waitlist approaches 25% for those without exception points. At the end of 2020, 12.1% of liver patients have remained on the waitlist for &gt;5 y.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> In Europe, for comparison, the wait time for organs is much lower.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Given the lifesaving and disease-altering nature of liver transplantation, the lack of availability of good-quality organs translates to loss of significant numbers of life years, and the need to address the organ deficit remains one of the greatest challenges in transplantation.</p>
    <p>Over the last decade, concerted efforts have been made to mitigate the organ deficit. These include expansion of the deceased donor pool via use of older donors, hepatitis C-positive donors, and increasingly utilizing donors declared dead based on cardiovascular criteria, or donation after circulatory death (DCD).<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p>
    <p>The allocation policy has also been reformed repeatedly in attempts to maximize the sharing potential and to recover organs for those patients who need them the most.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Other innovative advancements such as organ preservation with hypothermic and normothermic perfusion pumps and normothermic regional perfusion (NRP) of DCD donors offer promising potential to reshape the field of transplant.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p>
    <p>Areas for consideration in addressing the organ deficit include understanding what proportion of currently discarded organs are being underutilized, that is, either discarded after procurement or not procured at all, and considering what proportion of these organs could potentially be salvaged and utilized for transplant. While there are clear indications for discarding organs, such as malignancy, many factors contribute to the complex decision-making process as to whether to accept or reject an organ for an individual. The advent of modern technologies, biomarkers, logistical flexibility, and further insights into biology of organ injury could allow for safely increasing utilization of discarded organs.</p>
    <p>We sought to understand the national landscape of liver recovery and discard over the last 11 y. Our goal was to reexamine drivers of discard and nonutilization, using this as a basis to evaluate the success of interventions made and to identify areas for development. We sought to understand how discard and underutilization were related to several factors, including donor type and the underlying factors that led to organ discard and donor underutilization.</p>

      <title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title>
      <p>To perform this study, we used data from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients data. This database includes information on all US donors, candidates on the waitlist, and those who have received transplants submitted by members of the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network. Our analysis included all data from the &#x201C;Deceased Donor&#x201D; file from January 1, 2010, to December 1, 2021.</p>
      <p>Using the &#x201C;Deceased Donor&#x201D; file, data were extracted for all donors and analyzed by organ type. Data relevant to the following endpoints were extracted total number of donors, recovered organs, discarded organs, and transplanted organs. These were used to calculate discard rates by year. Donor factors such as donation after expanded criteria donor (ECD), DCD, Kidney Donor Profile Index, and biopsy findings were extracted. Nonrecovery and discard reasons were extracted using the database codes. For liver donors given the considerable number of discards coded as &#x201C;other,&#x201D; we used the variable &#x201C;LI_DISCARD_CD_OSTXT&#x201D; to reclassify the reason for discard. In the evaluation of ECDs, we reclassified donors as standard criteria donors, DCD, and ECD using the variables &#x201C;ECD_DONOR&#x201D; and &#x201C;NON_HRT_DONOR.&#x201D; Thus, ECD donors included all ECDs except for DCD donors.</p>
      <p>Discard rate was the ratio of number of discarded livers to the number of recovered livers. Analysis was performed of the discard rate per region. Regions were grouped into high, medium, and low discard based on the following criteria. The range of discard rates were divided into tertiles (low: 4.7&#x2013;8.5, moderate: 8.5&#x2013;12.3, high: 12.3&#x2013;16). To evaluate this further, we reviewed the ratio between organ discard and transplants performed per region as a comparator.</p>
      <p>Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS, Version 28.0.0.0. Graphs were generated using GraphPad Prism 9.3.1. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board.</p>

        <title>Liver Volumes, Sharing of Organs, Discard Rates, and Nonrecovery</title>
        <p>There was a 74% increase in available donors from 2010 to 2021 (7943&#x2013;13&#x2009;863 available donors), equating to an average increment of 538 donors per annum. From 2010 to 2021, the overall volume of liver transplantation increased by 44%. The percentage of livers from potential donors that went unrecovered increased from 17% to 31% over the 11-y period. Discard rates of recovered livers remained stable with a low of 8.3% in 2018 and a high of 10.4% in 2012 (Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p>

        <p>Standard criteria and extended criteria DBD donors had modest increases of utilization of 36% and 32%, respectively, &gt;11 y. From 2010 to 2021, transplantation of DCD donors increased by 239%, accounting for 10.6% of transplanted livers in 2021 compared with only 4.5% in 2010. Standard donor discard rates had a slight decrease from 6.4% to 5.2%. ECD donors discard rates decreased from 15.6% to 12%. Discard rates were highest for DCD donors, although, with a slight decrease from 32.9% in 2010 to 29.4% in 2021 (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).</p>

        <title>Regional Trends in Discards Rates</title>
        <p>Overall discard rates during the 11-y period varied substantially by region with the lowest rate of discard occurring in region 3 (4.7%) and the highest rate occurring in region 2 (16%) (Table <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Within regions, there was yearly fluctuation of discard rates between 2010 and 2021 (Figure <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Regions 3, 4, 7, 8, and 11 had relatively low variability in discard rate of &lt;5% range of discard rates. While regions 1, 5, 6, and 9 had greater variability with range of discard rates &gt;9%.</p>

        <title>Factors Driving Organ Discard</title>
        <p>The predominant reasons for discarding were organ factors (70%) and procurement factors (18%). The most common organ factor cited as reason for discard was biopsy findings, which accounted for 40% of all discards. Other discard reasons related to organ factors included diseased or unsuitable organ (17%), anatomic abnormalities (8%), and organ size (2%). Factors attributed to liver discard related to procurement factors included prolonged warm ischemic time (8.7%), organ trauma (3.5%), poor procurement flush (11.9%), and prolonged cold ischemic time (3.4%). Notably, 3.2% of livers were discarded due to recipient issues and were unable to be reallocated. No recipient was able to be located after the initial center declined in 5.5% of livers (Table <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>In this study, we reviewed available Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients data on deceased donor liver transplantation to gain an up-to-date understanding of how organ discard and donor nonutilization have changed in the United States over the last decade. Our aim was to identify windows of opportunities to decrease liver discard and underutilization of organ donors.</p>

        <title>DCD Donor Organs Are Still Highly Discarded and Underutilized</title>
        <p>In the last decade, we have seen an increase in the volume of liver transplantation, predominantly driven by the increased utilization of DCD liver for transplantation supported by research suggestive acceptable outcomes for select donor-recipient pairs. Despite this increase, almost 30% of livers discarded are DCD donors. That said, the promotion of DCD donor transplants performed in the United States still lags far behind European countries.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p>
        <p>What drives the relative underutilization of DCD organs in the United States is multifaceted, but it is partly due to the healthcare model differences that make transplant institutions more accountable for complications or failures.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> In addition, the rules, regulations, and societal understanding of DCD donation are better established in Europe.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> With that said, DCD donation remains the largest source of potential underutilized donors and transplant centers are clearly turning to using livers from these donors as demonstrated by the growth of DCD liver transplants over the last 3 y. The aggressiveness of transplant centers to pursue livers from these donors should be championed, with acceptance that at least in the short-term this may result in decreased discard.</p>

      <sec>
        <title>Why Are Organs Discarded in the United States?</title>
        <p>The reasons for liver discard are multifaceted. The predominant reason for discard is due to the biopsy findings and procurement factors, that is, prolonged warm ischemia time and injury. Pretransplant liver biopsy findings that typically result in the turning down of a liver include steatosis and fibrosis. Several studies have demonstrated an association between histological assessment and outcomes, although many of these associations are historical, and more recent data demonstrating these tools lack specificity.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> That said, histological assessment remains a valuable tool for the assessment of organs and to date remains one of the major assessment criteria for considering higher risk organs for transplant.</p>
        <p>Our analysis demonstrates a stable biopsy rate from 2010 to 2021. While some data has suggested expanding the limits of steatotic graft utilization,<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> our results demonstrate that the utilization of livers with steatosis &gt;30% remained largely unchanged, with a high of 6.5% in 2018 and a low of 3.8% in 2014.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>What Factors Drive Underutilization of Donors in the United States?</title>
        <p>Our analysis demonstrated that nonrecovery of organs from potential organ donors in the United States is driven by a multitude of reasons, the majority of which pertain to the nonsuitability of the donor organs for transplant purposes. Many of these factors are absolute contraindications to organ allocation, although some are continuing to be challenged as a reason for nonutilization. For example, HIV-positive donors to HIV recipient transplantation has been performed successfully by several centers throughout the United States. Although the data is not sufficiently granular to allow full extrapolation, we expect that part of the reasoning behind &#x201C;no recipient&#x201D; or &#x201C;refused&#x201D; reasons for nonutilization was owing to these risks. The extent of the nonutilization, however, is considerable, with 10&#x2009;000 livers not being retrieved over a 10-y period. We advocate for this to be an area to focus research going forward.</p>

        <title>Geographic Disparities in Liver Discard Rates</title>
        <p>We observed substantial variation between discard rates across regions. Geographic disparities are known to the transplant community and have been previously addressed by policy changes such as Share 35 and acuity circles. Interestingly, the regional discard rate did not correlate with transplant volume, importation rate, or DCD utilization. This suggests factors outside of those captured in this study drive this regional variation. However, these differences may offer additional target for decreasing discard rates. Certain regions may have higher tolerance for marginal organs that may be considered unacceptable in others. Current preservation strategies may limit the distances organs may travel thus necessitating discard.</p>

        <title>Reducing Discard and Nonutilization Using Machine Preservation</title>
        <p>Our data suggests that there are several potential high-yield targets that would allow for improved abdominal organ utilization and reduction of discard rates. One promising area is the rise of machine perfusion, hypothermic machine perfusion, and normothermic machine perfusion (NMP), which allows for ex vivo preservation. Early trials have demonstrated the success of both techniques.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>-<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> While machine perfusion remains costly and time-consuming to set up, streamlining this process for wider use may have significant impacts on organ utilization.</p>
        <p>The relatively short cold ischemic time accepted for liver transplant constrains the time and distance for liver sharing. In this study time constraints, cold ischemic time and donor-recipient mismatch comprised 14% of discards. If otherwise adequate, such grafts could be potentially transplanted if longer and oxygenated preservation was possible. Prolonged cold ischemic times using dual hypothermic oxygenated perfusion are currently explored in Europe.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Portable cold devices would provide a great solution to the larger distances between donor and recipient hospital that are seen in the United States. Longer preservation times by implementing NMP would potentially allow for reallocation, translating to 100 liver grafts per year.</p>
        <p>Another potential area for utilization of machine perfusion is in DCD donors, which are increasingly utilized but remain discarded at high rates. Dual hypothermic oxygenated perfusion has shown to decrease posttransplant complications in DCD liver transplantation, and NMP has shown to give a significant benefit in DCD donors with prolonged warm ischemic time.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup></p>
        <p>The use of NMP in steatosis livers also represents a substantial pool of nonutilized livers. Animal models and preliminary human trials suggest that NMP may protect against ischemia-reperfusion injury in steatotic livers. While a sizable percentage of steatotic livers may ultimately be unsuitable for transplantation, half of livers discarded due to biopsy findings being under the accepted macrosteatosis percentage of 30%. Furthermore, NMP could even be implemented as a therapeutic platform to treat organs with antisteatotic drugs.<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> However, further research in this area is crucial as it represents a massive proportion of nonutilized livers, particularly given the rise of obesity in America and subsequent decline in liver graft quality.<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup></p>
        <p>Another rising machine perfusion technique is NRP. In situ, the NRP of DCD donors converts the donor operation to a more standard donor operation type, thereby reducing the discard of organs due to procurement challenges and injuries. NRP also carries the benefit in resuscitating cellular function before transportation of an organ and has been shown by groups to reduce ischemic cholangiopathy rates in liver transplantation recipients.<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup></p>
        <p>We observed trends in organ discards and utilization over the last decade. Utilization of DCD donors has compromised a large portion of the increased liver transplant volume, however, remain discarded at high rate. Discard rates vary substantially between geographic regions. Improvement in preservation techniques and sharing between regions can reduce discard of organs due to geographic and time constraints. Given the rise of obesity and decline in liver graft quality understanding organ discard and underutilization is critical to maximize use of recovered livers.</p>
