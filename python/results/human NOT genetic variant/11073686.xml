The purpose of this study was to determine the toxic effect of ethyl paraben (C9H10O3) on the hematobiochemical, histological, oxidative, and anti-oxidant enzymatic and non-enzymatic activity; the study also evaluates the potential of ethyl paraben to cause genotoxicity in Rohu <italic toggle="yes">Labeo rohita</italic>. A number of 15 fish with an average weight of 35.45&#xB1;1.34g were placed in each group and exposed to ethyl paraben for 21 days. Three different concentrations of ethyl paraben, i.e., T<sub>1</sub> (2000&#x3BC;g/L), T<sub>2</sub> (4000 &#x3BC;g/L), andT<sub>3</sub> (6000 &#x3BC;g/L) on which fish were exposed as compared to the control T<sub>0</sub> (0.00 &#x3BC;g/L). Blood was used for hematobiochemical and comet assay. Gills, kidneys, and liver were removed for histological alterations. The results showed a significant rise in all hemato-biochemical parameters such as RBCs, WBCs, PLT count, blood sugar, albumin, globulin, and cholesterol. An increase in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) levels directed the hepatocytic damage. Histological alterations in the liver, gills and kidneys of fish were found. Ethylparaben induces oxidative stress by suppressing antioxidant enzyme activity such as SOD, GSH, CAT and POD. Based on the comet assay, DNA damage was also observed in blood cells, resulting in genotoxicity. Findings from the present study indicate that ethyl paraben induces hemato-biochemical alterations, tissue damage, oxidative stress, and genotoxicity.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors received no specific funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="8"/><table-count count="1"/><page-count count="18"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the manuscript and its <xref rid="sec025" ref-type="sec">Supporting information</xref> files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the manuscript and its <xref rid="sec025" ref-type="sec">Supporting information</xref> files.</p></notes></front>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Aquatic toxicity is a serious health hazard for aquatic ecosystems, including primary producers, microorganisms, fish, and humans, because water bodies contain fertilizers, insecticides, pesticides, and pharmaceutical chemicals that are added via leaching, runoff, and spray drift [<xref rid="pone.0302691.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Toxic chemicals discharged from anthropogenic activities [<xref rid="pone.0302691.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] become part of the aquaculture food chain and cause serious health problems for humans who feed on these contaminated products [<xref rid="pone.0302691.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p>
      <p>To meet the requirements of an increasing population, the use of disinfectants, drugs, preservatives, and antifoulant (biocides) chemicals to remove bacteria and fungi has increased in industries. Biocides in aquatic environments have toxic effects with demonstrated detrimental impacts [<xref rid="pone.0302691.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Parabens are produced when p-hydroxybenzoic acid is esterified in a catalyst and alcohol [<xref rid="pone.0302691.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. They are biocides and derivatives of esters of p-hydroxybenzoic acid [<xref rid="pone.0302691.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The antimicrobial and preservative abilities of parabens were first reported in 1924 [<xref rid="pone.0302691.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. For more than 70 years in food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries, it has been widely used as a preservative.</p>
      <p>Chemical inertness, low cost, worldwide acceptance, and reduced toxicity are the features of paraben that make it the favorite compound of chemists compared to all other biocides used in food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic products. Parabens are tasteless, odourless and effectively neutral in PH. They do not harden or discolor cosmetic products [<xref rid="pone.0302691.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The most common members of the paraben family are methylparaben, ethylparaben, propylparaben, butylparaben, and benzyl paraben. They are used separately and in combination with others. Mainly in the aqueous phase, influent contain (&#x2C3;97%) and wastewater treatment plants contain 79,600 ng/L concentrations of parabens [<xref rid="pone.0302691.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p>
      <p>Estrogenic effect of parabens on fish was observed by Bjerregaard, Andersen [<xref rid="pone.0302691.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, the impact of parabens on fish tissues and hematology has not been evaluated.</p>
      <p>Parabens enter the human body via dermal exposure, exhalation, and ingestion [<xref rid="pone.0302691.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Their negative effects on the body cause diabetes, neurotoxicity, adult obesity, and a reduction in the quality and quantity of human sperm. Parabens have been found in the tumour cells of breast cancer, which indicates that they increase the chances of cancer [<xref rid="pone.0302691.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. These toxic compounds harm endocrine function by interfering with endocrine system [<xref rid="pone.0302691.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p>
      <p>Ethylparaben (C<sub>9</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) is a member of the paraben family with a short chain of alkyl groups. The cell penetrability, stability, and antibacterial activity of parabens increase with the increase in the chain [<xref rid="pone.0302691.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The increase in the basal and vitellogenin levels in the blood by ethylparaben shows oestrogenic effects [<xref rid="pone.0302691.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Frederiksen, Taxvig [<xref rid="pone.0302691.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] studies on the pregnant rat observed that ethylparaben continues its exposure to the fetus by accumulating in the maternal plasma and placenta of the fetus.</p>
      <p>The present study aims to evaluate ethyl paraben&#x2019;s toxic effects on freshwater fish, <italic toggle="yes">Labeo rohita</italic>, as the concentration of ethyl paraben in aquatic environments increases day by day, which is harmful to aquatic organisms. Fish is a source of protein and part of the food chain; its consumption after being caught from polluted water resources is harmful to humans.</p>

        <title>Laboratory setting and animal handling</title>
        <p>All the experiments were performed in the laboratories of the Department of Zoology and Department of Fisheries, University of Okara, Okara, Pakistan. The standard protocols were followed for the preparation of chemicals and reagents. The ethical research committee (ERC) of the University of Okara, Pakistan, provided ethical approval (UO/ERC/2023/36) for fish handling. The fish were caught from the ponds at Head Balloki, District Kasur, Pakistan and then transported to the laboratories. During the fish&#x2019;s transport, the standard FAO protocol was followed; thereby no mortality occurred. Before transferring these fish to the experimental tank, they were first acclimatized with 0.1% KMNO<sub>4</sub> solution for 7 days to prevent fungal and microbial attacks. Commercially prepared feed (20% protein) was given to all the fish. Dissolved oxygen (DO) and pH of the water in the aquarium ranged from 6.25&#xB1;2.01 ppm and 7.2&#xB1;1.02, respectively. The ammonia and nitrate levels varied between 0.19&#x2013;0.47 ppm and 0.04&#x2013;0.14 ppm, respectively. The water temperature varied from 25.4 to 30.2&#xB0;C in the experimental tanks.</p>

        <title>Experimental design and treatment</title>
        <p>Four groups of fish were formed for experimental trial: a control group (T<sub>0</sub>) and three treatment groups (T<sub>1</sub>, T<sub>2</sub>, and T<sub>3</sub>) each with a triplicate. 15 fish were placed in each group (n = 15). A stock solution of ethylparaben was prepared using analytic-grade ethanol. LC<sub>50</sub> value of <italic toggle="yes">ethyl</italic> paraben for 48 hours was determined (LC50 = 12000 &#x3BC;g/L) by using the probit analysis method [<xref rid="pone.0302691.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Fish groups T<sub>0</sub>, T<sub>1</sub>, T<sub>2</sub>, and T<sub>3</sub> were exposed to different concentrations of ethylparaben 0 &#x3BC;g/L, 2000&#x3BC;g/L, 4000&#x3BC;g/L and 6000&#x3BC;g/L respectively, for 21 days. 90% of the water in each glass aquarium was replaced with fresh water every second day.</p>

        <title>Haematological and biochemical analysis</title>
        <p>The blood was procured by direct heart puncture and from the abdominal vein using disposable syringe and 22-gauge needle (Molnar 1960) [<xref rid="pone.0302691.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] (n = 3). The blood was collected in an EDTA tube for hematology and was transpired into mottled red top tubes for biochemical analysis. The haematological parameters, including RBC, hematocrit, haemoglobin, MCH, MCV, and MCHC, were assessed by an automatic haematological analyser (HEMA D6031). The white blood cell count was determined by following Ghaffar, Hussain [<xref rid="pone.0302691.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p>
        <p>For biochemical assay, the blood was centrifuged at 4&#xB0;C and 1,000 rpm for 10 min to separate plasma. Total protein, albumin, globulin, AST, ALT, total cholesterol, HDL-C and LDL-C were analysed using a chemistry analyzer (AU480, Beckman coulter, US). According to Waterborg [<xref rid="pone.0302691.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] method, the protein content of the samples was calculated using bovine serum albumin as standard. Glucose level was determined using the O-Toluidine assay [<xref rid="pone.0302691.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p>

        <p>The protocol of Barse, Chakrabarti [<xref rid="pone.0302691.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] was used for histological determination. At the end of the trial, fish were anesthesized with clove oil (50 &#x3BC;l/L) and dissected. Internal organs such as the liver, kidney, and gills were removed from the fish (n = 3). Samples were stored in 90% alcohol until further processing. They were first fixed in neutral buffered formalin, and then in 70% alcohol in four steps. The tissue was embedded in paraffin after preservation and dehydrated using a progressive alcohol series. 4&#x3BC;m sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and viewed using an Olympus BX40 microscope. The photographs were taken with a Nikon (SC 35 type 12) camera with a shutter speed of 30 seconds.</p>

Parabens belonging to one of these aquatic toxicants have anthropogenic effects and cause regional and localized pollution problems around the world [<xref rid="pone.0302691.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0302691.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. These toxicants, such as paraben, cause environmental disasters [<xref rid="pone.0302691.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p>
      <p>Hematological parameters are considered indicators for detecting toxicology. Different toxicants like parabens cause alterations in hematological parameters [<xref rid="pone.0302691.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. These alterations have been considered in response to high oxygen demands and gas transfer during stress conditions. The spleen and liver reactivate erythropoiesis in hypoxic conditions to compensate for increased oxygen demand in peripheral tissue [<xref rid="pone.0302691.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In the present study, the elevation in the concentrations of HGB, WBC, RBCs, HCT, MCV, MCH, MCHC, and platelet count has been observed after exposure to different concentrations of ethyl paraben to cope with stress conditions. Our results are supported by the study done by Park, Lee [<xref rid="pone.0302691.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], which has observed an increased level of RBCs, HGB, Hct, MCV, MCH, and MCHC in rats after exposure to parabens. Similar rises in RBCs, HGB, and Hct in male rates have been observed by &#x130;NKAYA, KARABULUT [<xref rid="pone.0302691.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The higher concentration of WBCs and PLT count after exposure to ethyl paraben has been observed in the present study. Therefore, a similar decrease in the concentration of WBCs and PLT count after exposure has been detected by &#x130;NKAYA, KARABULUT [<xref rid="pone.0302691.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. No previous work has been found on ethylparaben exposure to fish. This increase in WBCs is due to the infection and inflammation caused by ethylparaben exposure to the body. During the infection state, the immune system activates, and white blood cell concentration increases [<xref rid="pone.0302691.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Ethylparaben exposure causes inflection due to which platelet count increases from low to high concentration as compared to the control. This increase in platelet count is due to thrombocytosis&#x2014;a condition that causes an increase in platelet concentration in the infectious state [<xref rid="pone.0302691.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p>
      <p>Parabens such as ethylparaben, being endocrine disruptors, interfere with normal function in many processes and alter them like the immune system, lipid homeostasis, glucose level, and thyroid functioning [<xref rid="pone.0302691.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Many hormones, like testosterone and oestrogen, are prepared from lipids. Results of the lipid profile after being exposed to different concentrations of ethyl paraben showed a significant increase in cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and VLDL cholesterol as compared to the control group. Kim and Chevrier [<xref rid="pone.0302691.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] also recorded the same increase in cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and VLDL cholesterol in humans, both male and female. Lipids cannot breakdown in the blood and must be delivered to and from cells via low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and high density lipoproteins (HDL). High density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) transports cholesterol from the arteries to the liver. As a result, excessive serum cholesterol levels may be caused by hepatic dysfunction [<xref rid="pone.0302691.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Triglycerides act as a source of immediate and stored energy. Due to high energy demand in stress conditions, the fish showed high triglyceride levels. The current study evaluates the toxic effect of ethyl paraben on hepatic tissues. For liver alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), blood sugar, total protein, albumin, and globulin are good biomarkers for hepatic toxicity. The results of serum biochemical showed that all these parameters were elevated significantly as compared to the control group. These results were supported by the findings of Beriry, Atef [<xref rid="pone.0302691.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] and Darbre and Harvey [<xref rid="pone.0302691.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The increases in liver enzymes occur directly in response to liver toxicity caused by ethylparaben in hepatocytes. The primary function of the liver is to detoxify toxic chemicals and produce antioxidant enzymes such as catalase that break down hydrogen peroxide. That&#x2019;s why the liver is a primary organ to be damaged due to paraben toxicity [<xref rid="pone.0302691.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Blood glucose levels also increased after exposure to ethylparaben. Similar increases in blood sugar were recorded by Bellavia, Chiu [<xref rid="pone.0302691.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] in pregnant women after they put them at risk for gestational diabetes. No previous study on lipid profile and blood glucose level was found on the fish exposed to ethylparaben in a laboratory or natural environment.</p>
      <p>Biochemical alterations are confirmed by histological changes in the current study. In fish, gills are primary organs in contact with water and are involved in osmoregulation, respiration, and excretion. Hence, they remain the primary target for toxicants. Histology of the gills revealed that after exposure to ethylparaben, the gills showed lamellar disorganization, fusion of primary lamellae, lamellar aneurysm, hyperplasia of epithelial cells, and bone cell deformities of secondary lamellae. The alterations in gills, like epithelial lifting, hyperplasia, and fusion of epithelial cells, were also reported by Camargo and Martinez [<xref rid="pone.0302691.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. A similar alteration in histology of the gills after exposure to paraben, as recorded by Beriry, Atef [<xref rid="pone.0302691.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] supports our present study.</p>
      <p>The kidney, being a vital organ in osmoregulation and excretion, also remains an easy target for toxicants [<xref rid="pone.0302691.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The most common defects caused by water toxicants are tubule degeneration, dilation of capillaries, and degeneration of parenchyma cells of the kidney Irnidayanti, Fatona [<xref rid="pone.0302691.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Similar changes came out as results of kidney histology of <italic toggle="yes">L</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">rohita</italic> like, glomerular expansion and absence of Bowman&#x2019;s capsule, tubular cells with hypertrophied nuclei, Sinusoidal spaces, cluster nuclei formation, Melano-macrophages, and damaged parenchyma cells as compared to the control, which showed a normal arrangement of the glomerulus in the kidney of <italic toggle="yes">L</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">rohita</italic>.</p>
      <p>The primary organ in the body involved in detoxification and biotransformation of toxicants is liver. Therefore, it is one of the most affected organs due to aquatic toxicity [<xref rid="pone.0302691.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. A normal liver has regular shaped hepatocytes, cytoplasmic vacuolation, and a nucleus in a lateral position. The cytoplasm of hepatocytes contains lipids and glycogen inside vacuoles, which are used in normal metabolic functions. During stressful conditions, glycogen inside hepatocytes is depleted because glycogen acts as a reserve for glucose. Due to these large spaces (sinusoidal spaces), hepatocytes are formed [<xref rid="pone.0302691.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The increase in vacuolization is an indication of metabolic damage due to the toxicity caused by ethyl paraben. The histology of the liver showed pyknotic nuclei, eosinophilia granules, Sinusoidal spaces, necrosis, and Melano-macrophages.</p>
      <p>The results of ethylparaben exposure show that ethylparaben causes biochemical alteration and fluctuations in enzymatic activity. Oxidative stress is used to find out the damage caused by ROS (reactive oxygen species) and TBARS (Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances) such as hydroxyl radicals (OH<sup>&#x2212;</sup>), hydrogen peroxides (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), and superoxide (O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup>). A large amount of chemicals has toxic effects, such as inducing oxidative stress. The body&#x2019;s antioxidant defence systems include SOD, catalase, POD, and GSH. Xenobiotics such as ethylparaben suppress antioxidant activity, due to which large number of free radicles accumulate and damage cellular components like DNA, and carbohydrates [<xref rid="pone.0302691.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Soft tissues of the body, including the liver, kidney and gills are more susceptible to free radicals&#x2019; attacks because they are involved in metabolism, excretion etc.</p>
      <p>The results of oxidative stress biomarkers such as TBARS and ROS showed that ethyl paraben exposure induces oxidative stress. In tissue damage, the primary biomarker for lipid peroxidation is TBARS assay. TBARS assay is the measurement of MDA (malondialdehyde) [<xref rid="pone.0302691.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Due to being lipophilic in nature, ethylparaben can easily cross the plasma membrane and increase MDA level and consequently increase ROS. A high level of ROS suppresses the antioxidant system, which works as an antagonistic to oxidative enzymes. Elevated ROS and decreased antioxidant systems change redox potential of plasma membrane and cause oxidative stress in soft tissues such as hepatocytes, renal tissues, and gill filaments. After exposure to ethylparaben, elevated levels of Lipid peroxidase (POD) were recorded in the tissues. Our results are supported by the findings of Shah and Verma [<xref rid="pone.0302691.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] and Silva, Serrano [<xref rid="pone.0302691.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>].</p>
      <p>A significantly decreased level of GSH (glutathione) was recorded in fish <italic toggle="yes">L</italic>.<italic toggle="yes">rohita</italic>. GSH is an antioxidant and free radical scavenger. Shah and Verma [<xref rid="pone.0302691.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] also reported a similar decreased level of GSH after exposure to parabens. Another study by Silva, Serrano [<xref rid="pone.0302691.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] shows that parabens exposure significantly increases GSH levels. This suppression of GSH level indicates the high concentration of free radicles. The number of free radicals is greater than the scavenging ability of GSH. The first line of defence against ROS-induced damage is enzymatic anti-oxidants, including catalase, SOD, and GSH [<xref rid="pone.0302691.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0302691.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Our results indicate significant decrease in antioxidants such as catalase, SOD, and GSH. The decrease is possibly due to the protein oxidation caused by ethylparaben. Increased Peroxidase levels interact with enzymes and reduce enzyme activity, resulting in modifications in histidine residues and protein crosslink [<xref rid="pone.0302691.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Similar findings were observed by Silva, Serrano [<xref rid="pone.0302691.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] and Shah and Verma [<xref rid="pone.0302691.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The results of oxidative stress and antioxidant enzymes indicate a reduction in the scavenging activity of antioxidant system on free radicals. Hence, ethylparaben causes oxidative stress in <italic toggle="yes">L</italic>.<italic toggle="yes">rohita</italic>.</p>
      <p>DNA strand breakage, such as Olive tail moment (OTM) and percentage tail DNA to blood cells, was confirmed by comet assay in <italic toggle="yes">L</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">rohita</italic>. The results of the comet assay confirmed that ethyl paraben causes genotoxicity. Genotoxicity caused by parabens in human lymphocytes was previously evaluated by G&#xFC;zel Bay&#xFC;lken, Ayaz T&#xFC;yl&#xFC; [<xref rid="pone.0302691.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] which supports our results. Similarly genotoxicity caused by parabens was also evaluated by Mart&#xED;n, Peropadre [<xref rid="pone.0302691.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] in the liver cells of monkeys.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>In fish, ethylparaben exposure over a longer period of time alters their hemato-biochemistry. As their concentration rises, so does their toxicity. Indicators of ethyl paraben&#x2019;s harmful effects, primarily on kidney, gills, and liver tissues, were also shown to have undergone histological modification. Ethylparaben causes oxidative stress, and, antioxidant enzyme activity is inhibited when exposed to ethylparaben. A comet assay used on blood cells exposed to ethylparaben also revealed genotoxicity. According to the study&#x2019;s findings, prolonged exposure to ethyl paraben harms aquatic life and changes its typical anatomical and physiological features, as well as oxidant and antioxidant enzyme activity and DNA damage.</p>

      <p>Dear Dr.&#xA0;Shahzad,<!-- </div> --><!-- <div> --></p>
      <p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE&#x2019;s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p>
      <p>Please submit your revised manuscript by Dec 20 2023 11:59PM. If you will need more time than this to complete your revisions, please reply to this message or contact the journal office at&#xA0;<email>plosone@plos.org</email>. When you're ready to submit your revision, log on to <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/</ext-link> and select the 'Submissions Needing Revision' folder to locate your manuscript file.</p>
      <p>Please include the following items when submitting your revised manuscript:<!-- </div> --><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>A rebuttal letter that responds to each point raised by the academic editor and reviewer(s). You should upload this letter as a separate file labeled 'Response to Reviewers'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A marked-up copy of your manuscript that highlights changes made to the original version. You should upload this as a separate file labeled 'Revised Manuscript with Track Changes'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>An unmarked version of your revised paper without tracked changes. You should upload this as a separate file labeled 'Manuscript'.</p></list-item></list></p>
      <p>If you would like to make changes to your financial disclosure, please include your updated statement in your cover letter. Guidelines for resubmitting your figure files are available below the reviewer comments at the end of this letter.</p>
      <p>If applicable, we recommend that you deposit your laboratory protocols in protocols.io to enhance the reproducibility of your results. Protocols.io assigns your protocol its own identifier (DOI) so that it can be cited independently in the future. For instructions see: <ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-laboratory-protocols" ext-link-type="uri">https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-laboratory-protocols</ext-link>. Additionally, PLOS ONE offers an option for publishing peer-reviewed Lab Protocol articles, which describe protocols hosted on protocols.io. Read more information on sharing protocols at <ext-link xlink:href="https://plos.org/protocols?utm_medium=editorial-email&amp;utm_source=authorletters&amp;utm_campaign=protocols" ext-link-type="uri">https://plos.org/protocols?utm_medium=editorial-email&amp;utm_source=authorletters&amp;utm_campaign=protocols</ext-link>.</p>
      <p>We look forward to receiving your revised manuscript.</p>

      <p>4. In your Data Availability statement, you have not specified where the minimal data set underlying the results described in your manuscript can be found. PLOS defines a study's minimal data set as the underlying data used to reach the conclusions drawn in the manuscript and any additional data required to replicate the reported study findings in their entirety. All PLOS journals require that the minimal data set be made fully available. For more information about our data policy, please see <ext-link xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability" ext-link-type="uri">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability</ext-link>.</p>
      <p>Upon re-submitting your revised manuscript, please upload your study&#x2019;s minimal underlying data set as either Supporting Information files or to a stable, public repository and include the relevant URLs, DOIs, or accession numbers within your revised cover letter. For a list of acceptable repositories, please see <ext-link xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability#loc-recommended-repositories" ext-link-type="uri">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability#loc-recommended-repositories</ext-link>. Any potentially identifying patient information must be fully anonymized.</p>
      <p>Important: If there are ethical or legal restrictions to sharing your data publicly, please explain these restrictions in detail. Please see our guidelines for more information on what we consider unacceptable restrictions to publicly sharing data: <ext-link xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability#loc-unacceptable-data-access-restrictions" ext-link-type="uri">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability#loc-unacceptable-data-access-restrictions</ext-link>. Note that it is not acceptable for the authors to be the sole named individuals responsible for ensuring data access.</p>
      <p>We will update your Data Availability statement to reflect the information you provide in your cover letter.</p>
      <p>5. We note that you have indicated that data from this study are available upon request. PLOS only allows data to be available upon request if there are legal or ethical restrictions on sharing data publicly.

      <p>Material and method section</p>
      <p>1-line 91, replace made with assigned</p>
      <p>2-number of fish and weight should be mentioned</p>
      <p>3-what is the LC50 value for ethyl parapen, why authors evaluated it for 48 hours not for 96 hours</p>
      <p>4- What is the relation between the lC50 and the different doses of parapen used in the experiment?</p>
      <p>5-line 109, add the dose of clove oil and reference</p>
      <p>6-the number of samples should be written for each group in all methodology (blood samples, histological samples, &#x2026;.etc)</p>
      <p>7-the procedures of histological examinations is lack many details, so superficial</p>
      <p>The details should be added</p>
      <p>8- All abbreviations should be defined for the first time</p>
      <p>9- For the statistical analysis, the normality test should be performed before the ANOVA</p>
      <p>Results</p>
      <p>1- All tables titles should be rephrased and rewritten</p>
      <p>2- Table footnotes should be added and the full names of all measured parameters should be inserted in the footnote</p>
      <p>3- Line 196, the author written (propyl paraben), the authors used ethyl paraben or propyl paraben</p>
      <p>4- All data in the figures and tables should be carefully revised by the authors</p>
      <p>Discussion section</p>
      <p>This part should be revised and improved</p>
      <p>Line 320-321 why written in italic form</p>
      <p>Many language errors are present</p>
      <p>Conclusion section: this section not present</p>
      <p>Reviewer #2:&#xA0;1. The abstract has not been written in a clear and concise manner. For example the paragraph starting with ethyl paraben induced oxidative .....; is not stating the findings clearly.</p>
      <p>2. There is reference to genotoxicity in the abstract. However, it is not clear which marker for genotoxicity was used to arrive at this conclusion. If this was based on the COMET Assay, then indicate that "based on the comet assay, ....</p>
      <p>3. Under methods: it is not clear how the dosages of 2000, 4000, and 6000 were chosen. Is this based on actual estimated concentrations of paraben in contaminated waterways? How much paraben is fish exposed to in water? Do they bio-accumulate in fish tissues? What steps were taken to ensure that prior exposure to paraben and related chemicals did not occur in regard to fish used for the study? This needs to come out clearly.</p>
      <p>4. Quite significantly, the manuscript has recurring grammar issues, and poor prose/sentence construction. For example, the sentence that reads..." all experiments were formed.... The word "formed" is quite out of place. This is repeated throughout (line 75). Experiments are "conducted or performed" etc... Do not use don't..., rather use do not etc...</p>
      <p>5. Did the study investigate levels of glutathione or glutathione reductase? In the results, the sub-title is GSH, which is used to abbreviate glutathione and not glutathione reductase. In the discussion and figures, references have been made in regard to antioxidants including glutathione (GSH). Where does glutathione reductase come in line 140-144?</p>
      <p>6. Hematology data has been presented in a table format. This is not correct. Dose response studies are best presented using line graphs to easily decipher the trend. This observation applies to antioxidant analysis (GSH, TBARS, ROS, SOD, CAT etc..)</p>
      <p>7. The data on antioxidant assay is quite confusing for liver/kidney. ROS is going up, consistent with TBARS; but antioxidant enzymes that are meant to be up-regulated in response to exposure to chemical toxicants such as paraben are actually being down-regulated. This is a paradox. Note that there is a dose-dependent rise in ROS. Antioxidants are expected to rise in concert to the rise in ROS. For this study, antioxidants are going down as the dose of paraben goes up. However, many studies have demonstrated depletion of GSH levels in response to overwhelming chemical-induced oxidative stress. This may explain the decrease in GSH. Not sure about the SOD, CAT etc..,. This scenario may be possible when there is overwhelming oxidative stress, depleting all the antioxidants. Clarify this phenomenon. Notably, liver function markers are all up-regulated, signaling severe paraben-driven liver injury.</p>
      <p>8. Data for hematology shows evidence for paraben-driven significant up-regulation of platelets. This elevation will have serious implications for blood-related disorders like DVT and patients who may be on blood thinning medications. This aspect needs to be discussed more broadly in the discussion section to highlight implications in various circumstances. Infact, RBCs and HGB will be expected to be down-regulated due to a possible paraben-driven impediment to hematopoiesis.</p>
      <p>9. It is not clear why paraben will result in elevation of HGB, MCV, MCHC and platelets.</p>
      <p>10. Notably, at low dosages, the effect of paraben on blood indices was low, validating the premise of this study. This, probably needs to come out well in the discussion.</p>
      <p>11. It is very important that the grammar issues are corrected, and the manuscript is written carefully in a concise and logical manner using appropriate english.</p>
      <p>12. There is need for a more concise title tied to the major findings of the study.</p>

      <p>11 It is very important that the grammar issues are corrected, and the manuscript is written carefully in a concise and logical manner using appropriate english </p>

After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE&#x2019;s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p>
      <p>Please submit your revised manuscript by Jan 22 2024 11:59PM. If you will need more time than this to complete your revisions, please reply to this message or contact the journal office at&#xA0;<email>plosone@plos.org</email>.

      <p>Dear Dr. Shahzad,</p>
      <p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE&#x2019;s publication criteria as it currently stands.&#xA0;I have observed that your response to the reviewers' comments was not addressed carefully, and the quality of English in your manuscript still needs improvement. Therefore, we recommend that you adhere to the instructions by providing detailed responses to the reviewers in a separate file and enhancing&#xA0;English&#xA0;in your manuscript.<!-- </div> --><!-- <div> -->&#xA0;<!-- </div> --><!-- <div> -->The attached file contains the comments from the reviewers. Please carefully consider every point and respond to them individually, addressing each one separately.</p>
      <p>Please submit your revised manuscript by May 17 2024 11:59PM.

      <p>Please include the following items when submitting your revised manuscript:<!-- </div> --><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>A rebuttal letter that responds to each point raised by the academic editor and reviewer(s). You should upload this letter as a separate file labeled 'Response to Reviewers'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A marked-up copy of your manuscript that highlights changes made to the original version. You should upload this as a separate file labeled 'Revised Manuscript with Track Changes'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>An unmarked version of your revised paper without tracked changes.
