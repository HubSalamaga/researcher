      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>A revised definition of pain is a distressing experience related to actual or potential tissue damage with sensory, emotional, cognitive, and social components [<xref rid="pone.0300853.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In line with the definition of the International Association for the Study of Pain, &#x201C;Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience related to actual or potential tissue damage&#x201D; or pain is usually a private experience that&#x2019;s influenced to varying degrees by biological, psychological, and social factors [<xref rid="pone.0300853.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p>
      <p>Pain is the most misunderstood, underdiagnosed, and under-treated/untreated medical problems, particularly in children. One of the foremost challenging roles of medical providers serving children is to appropriately assess and treat their pain. Currently, pain is &#x201C;the fifth vital sign&#x201D; and requires caregivers and health professionals to assess regularly to deal with pain. Pain could be a personal experience; many terms are used to describe different sensations. Pain assessment in children is linked to their level of development. Children of identical age vary widely in their perception and tolerance of pain [<xref rid="pone.0300853.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In 2014, the Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH) with the American Cancer Society launched the Pain-Free Hospital Initiative to integrate pain treatment into service delivery by providing education for hospital staff, raising motivation and awareness, measuring and documenting pain levels, and improving medicine supply [<xref rid="pone.0300853.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>
      <p>A prospective cross-sectional survey conducted in US hospitals showed that 76% of hospitalized patients had experienced pain during the previous 24 hours, usually acute or procedural pain, and 12% suffered from chronic pain. From those, 20% of children experienced moderate and 30% had severe pain in that period. The worst pain reported by patients was caused by needle pokes (40%), followed by trauma/injury 34% [<xref rid="pone.0300853.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p>
      <p>In Ethiopia, the overall prevalence of pain among hospitalized children was 76.2%, 70% of the children had mild to moderate pain and 6.2% had severe pain based on the age-appropriate assessment tools [<xref rid="pone.0300853.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p>
      <p>Nurses managing their pain ineffectively affects the patient&#x2019;s quality of life negatively and results in higher hospital readmission rates, more repeated outpatient visits, prolonged hospital stays, increased risk of hospital-acquired infection, and increased stress and anxiety for the patient as well as his family. Untreated persistent pain causes several potential complications like anxiety, depression, insomnia, fatigue, poor concentration and short-term memory, stress-related health problems, lack of daily structure and feeling aimless, and also lack of meaning or direction in life. Similarly, untreated pain leads to biological, psychological, social, developmental, and behavioral problems in children [<xref rid="pone.0300853.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p>
      <p>The factors associated with a low level of practice are; availability of drugs and equipments, availability of protocols and guidelines, work overload, lack of in-service training, lack of pain assessment tools, short duration of experience in pain management, and low level of knowledge and attitude in pediatrics pain management [<xref rid="pone.0300853.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0300853.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>
      <p>A study conducted at Jimma hospital showed that the overall level of nurses&#x2019; pain management practice was 36.6% [<xref rid="pone.0300853.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. A study conducted in Black Lion hospital showed that 52.7% of respondents had good practice regarding pediatric pain management [<xref rid="pone.0300853.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The overall non-pharmacology pain management practice level of nurses in Debre Tabor comprehensive specialized hospital showed that only 44(26%) of nurses had good practice on non-pharmacology pain management methods [<xref rid="pone.0300853.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. A study conducted in the Amhara region referral hospital showed that the practice of nurses; out of a total of 289 respondents, 54.3% had poor practice and 45.7% had good practice [<xref rid="pone.0300853.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. A cross-sectional institution-based study conducted in Bahir Dar City HCPS showed that 76.8% of respondents used the WHO pain management ladder to manage pain. 95.5% of the respondents used paracetamol, and 84.5% of the respondents used NSAIDS to manage pain. The majority of the participants (79.3%) used analgesics during bone marrow aspiration and (72.3%) during wound care [<xref rid="pone.0300853.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In Ethiopia, little is known about pediatrics pain management practice among nurses in hospitalized children. As many studies showed, pain is unrecognized and undertreated by healthcare professionals all over the world. Thus, managing pain properly is the only option that can prevent children from unnecessarily staying in hospitals and suffering from pain. In Ethiopia as well as in the Amhara regional state, little is known about the practice and factors associated with pediatric pain management among nurses. Therefore, the result of this study was used to highlight the gaps in pain management practice and help to identify factors affecting pain management practice.</p>
      <p>Therefore, this research aimed to assess the practice and factors associated with pediatric pain management for hospitalized children among nurses working in Bahir Dar city public hospitals using a mixed-study design.</p>

        <title>Study area and period</title>
        <p>The study was conducted at Bahir Dar city public hospitals, Amhara regional state, North West Ethiopia. Currently, from the three public hospitals in the city 834 [474 at FHCSH, 310 at TGCSH, and 50 at AAPH] nurses were found in different qualifications. Of those nurses, 733[380 at FHCSH, 303 at TGCSH, and 50 at AAPH] were working at in-patient departments and those have contact with a variety of patients with pain. The study was conducted between November 1 to 30/ 2022.</p>

        <title>Sample size determination</title>
        <p>For the quantitative part: The sample size was determined by using a single population proportion formula, taking the proportion as 45.7% from a previous study conducted in public referral hospitals of Amhara region, Ethiopia (8), 95% confidence interval (CI) and 5% margin of error. Thus, the sample size is calculated as follows: -</p>

          <title>Data collection tool</title>
          <p>The questionnaire was adapted by using different literatures related to this topic. For quantitative data: a structured self-administered English version questionnaire was used. It has five parts; the first section is socioeconomic variables (08 items). The second section contains questions that can measure the practice of nurses for pain management (19 items). The other section contains questions that can measure the knowledge of nurses for pain management (14 major items), questions that can measure the attitude of nurses toward pain management (15 items), and questions that can measure organization and patient-related factors for pain management in hospitalized children (12 items).</p>
          <p>For qualitative data: semi structured in-depth interview was used. The principal investigator was the data collector. The interview was initiated with general questions followed by probing questions, and then the questions became more focused as the data collection progressed.</p>

          <title>Data collection procedure</title>
          <p>Data collection was facilitated by seven bachelor of science (BSC) holder nurses (six data collectors and one supervisor) after taking two-day training to familiarize the data collection procedure and instrument on the objective and relevance of the study. Data collectors were supervised at each site. The principal investigator and the supervisors collected the filled questionnaire and checked for missed values and completeness daily.</p>
          <p>For qualitative: semi-structured, face-to-face in-depth interviews having open-ended questions used a guide, tape recorder, and notebooks were employed among nurses working at public hospitals. The modulator and the principal investigator were introduced to the purpose of the study, assured them about confidentiality, and took informed verbal consent. The study setting was chosen such that the privacy of the participants could be maintained, the location was comfortable, noisy areas were avoided, and the location should be easily accessible.</p>

        <title>Data quality control</title>
        <p>Two-day training was given for both data collectors and supervisors. Before the actual data collection, the items were tested on 21 (5% of 421) nurses working out of the study area (Debre Tabor hospital) and the result was used to check clarity and completeness, understandability; flow and construction, internal consistency of questionnaire and those questions found to be unclear or confusing have been modified based on the result of the pretest.</p>
        <p>The principal investigator and trained supervisor supervised and reviewed every data collection procedure, and questionnaire for completeness and logical consistency and correction made. The principal investigator collected the completed questionnaires every day and was responsible for the coordination and on-the-spot supervision of the overall data collection process. The principal investigator was performing data coding, entry, and cleaning.</p>

        <title>Data processing and analysis</title>
        <p>First data was checked for completeness and then a unique code was assigned for each completed questionnaire. Subsequently, data entered using Epi-info version 7.1. The generated data was exported to a statistical package for social sciences (SPSS) version 25. Analysis was done with descriptive statistics by using frequency, percentage, and mean. Bivariate and multivariate analysis between dependent and independent variables was performed using logistic regression. Variables with a p-value less than 0.25 in the bivariable analysis were taken as the candidates for the multivariable logistic regression model. Logistic regression model fitness was checked using Hosmer &amp; Lemeshow&#x2019;s goodness of fit test, which was 0.71. During the analysis, crude and adjusted odds ratios at 95% confidence interval (CI) and p-value less than 0.05 were considered. A p-value of less than 0.05 was taken as a significant association; results were present in text, tables, charts, and graphs.</p>
        <p>Quantitative data is triangulated with qualitative data. The qualitative data was analyzed through the thematic analysis using Atlas ti version 7.0 software. Major and subthemes were created from the text itself through repeated reading. After reading the transcripts, the investigator identified emergent themes and then coded each theme to delineate individual topics. Statements are grouped by code to the corresponding theme. The findings were present in narratives by thematic areas and support the quantitative data.</p>

        <title>Trustworthiness and rigor of the study</title>
        <p>For the qualitative part, the guides were originally developed in English and then translated into the local language Amharic for data collection. After data collection, verbatim transcription was applied to transcribe the audio-record interview into Amharic and then again translated into English for analysis. When necessary, the transcripts were supplemented by field notes to clarify issues. In the meantime, English transcripts were read many times to develop codes that identify important and common concepts that relate to the main themes of the study. The principal investigators used Atlas ti software for coding. Each transcript was screened, quoted, and coded. The codes in turn grouped into sub-themes and then into main themes.</p>

        <title>Credibility</title>
        <p>To maintain credibility, before the data collection, the investigators evaluated the in-depth interview questions. All members who participated in the study took orientation about the purpose of the study and the responsibility given before the interview took place to avoid unnecessary interruption and keep the rights of the participants. Professionals before data collection were evaluated the interview guide.</p>

          <title>The practice of nurses in pediatrics pain management</title>
          <p>Of the 403 respondents, 326(80.9%) reported that they assess pain for children, but only 138(34.2%) use a pain assessment tool, from those 75 (18.6%) participants use the tool routinely. Of the participants, only 114(28.3%) use the self-reported pain scale (FACE scale), while 91(22.6%) use the behavioral pain scale (FLACC scale). Two hundred twenty (54.6%) of nurses are who administer pain medication by their adjustment and 291 (72.2%) of nurses administer pain medication to relieve pain when needed (PRN) for children. Of the participants 269 (66.7%) nurses documented the findings after pain assessment and management while the rest were not documented. The majority of the participants should not assess and administer analgesia before repositioning 368 (91.3%) and endo-tracheal suctioning 280(69.5%). Whereas, 199 (49.4%), and 277(68.7%) nurses were assessed and administered anti-pain drugs during pre and postoperative care and wound care respectively (<bold><xref rid="pone.0300853.t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref></bold>).</p>

          <title>Factors affecting pediatrics pain management practice</title>
          <p>For the inferential analysis of the data, bi-variable and multivariable logistic regressions were done by using binary logistic regression.</p>
          <p>According to bi-variable analysis, years of experience in nursing, qualification, year of experience in pediatrics unit, good knowledge and favorable attitude of nurses, availability of anti-pain drugs, nurses workload, availability of pain management tools, gating pain management training, having specific pain management protocol in the institutions, no designated area and material for pain management, problems due to awareness of families as well as the child and children cooperate in managing pain having history on pain management were eligible for multivariable analysis (p&lt;0.25). Subsequently, these variables were entered into the multivariable analysis</p>
          <p>In multivariable binary logistic regression analysis only the knowledge and attitude of participants, qualified in BSC pediatrics and child health nurses, year of experience in the pediatrics department, and gating pain management training were significantly associated with the pain management practice of nurses (p&lt;0.05).</p>
          <p>Based on findings from the multivariable binary logistic regression, in this study nurses who had good knowledge were four times [AOR = 3.95; 95% CI: (2.30, 6.79)] more likely to practice pediatrics pain management compared to those who had poor knowledge. Similarly, nurses who had favorable attitudes toward pain management were three times [AOR = 2.57; 95% CI: (1.53, 4.30)] more likely able to practice pain management for hospitalized children than those who had unfavorable attitudes.</p>
          <p>In addition, BSC pediatrics and child health nurses were seven times [(AOR = 6.53; 95%CI (1.56, 27.25)] more likely to practice pediatrics pain management than nurses who qualified as diploma nurses. Similarly, nurses who had 2&#x2013;5 years and 5&#x2013;10 years of experience in pediatrics unit were two times (AOR = 1.92;95%CI:(1.03,3.56), and five times (AOR = 5.41;95%CI:(2.42,12.08) more likely able to practice pediatrics pain management compared to those nurses who had less than two years of experiences in pediatrics unit respectively.</p>
          <p>Finally, those respondents who received in-service training about pediatrics pain management were three times [AOR = 3.31; 95% CI: (1.73, 6.33) more likely to practice pain management for hospitalized children than those who did have not in-service training on pain management (<bold><xref rid="pone.0300853.t007" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref></bold>).</p>

          <title>Theme 1: Inadequate Knowledge on pain assessment and management practice</title>
          <p>All participants expressed their clinical experience regarding to the assessment and/or management of pain in children during the interview. From theme one, there are two sub-themes those are inadequate knowledge of pain assessment methods and inadequate knowledge of pain management practice were barriers to proper pain management in children.</p>
          <p><italic toggle="yes">Sub-theme 1</italic>: <italic toggle="yes">Adequate knowledge of pain assessment methods</italic>. Most of the participants describe that, their most common pain assessment method was by observing the child&#x2019;s facial expression or behavior like crying as well as other ways of expressing their pain level, using vital signs to verify pain, and family reports were used to determine the level of a child&#x2019;s pain. Similarly, most of the participants reported that we are not using the assessment tool, they overlook pain assessment tools some participants do not know there is a pain assessment tool specifically for children. One of the study participants describes as follows: -</p>

            <p>&#x201C;<italic toggle="yes">&#x2026;</italic> &#x2026;<italic toggle="yes">At first</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">we will do vital signs; their temperature is included</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">it is a way to assess them because they are sick</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">Another one is that when you see them</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">their faces are contorted</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">We can understand the level of pain by looking at children</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">who are very sick</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">Especially</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">if children with fractures because they scream a lot</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">It can be understood because they do not touch their bodies</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">Even though children cannot say that this is what hurts them; we can understand their behavior</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">Otherwise</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">nothing is set at the manual level&#x201D;</italic>. (P5, age 30)</p>
          </disp-quote>
          <p>Similarly, another participant expressed <italic toggle="yes">&#x201C;As soon as they arrive</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">they will be taken for vital signs and then we will take a pain assessment for example</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">they may have a temperature; They can make themselves unconscious</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">Lethargic; there may be trauma</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">We look at these things and give ourselves a score of pain</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">If the temperature is above 38</italic>.<italic toggle="yes">5; if so; from what mothers tell us</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">sometimes they cry a lot</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">they say that they throw up and we set a level from here</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">If the other is difficult and you cannot describe it</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">we will see the level of pain</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">We don&#x2019;t use anything&#x201D;</italic>. (P6, age 30)</p>
          <p>Most of the participants reported that assessing a child&#x2019;s pain is difficult because they cannot express their feelings like adults so they need special skills and knowledge to assess the child&#x2019;s pain but now this is a big challenge. 36 years old, male participant expressed as follows;</p>
          <disp-quote>
            <p><italic toggle="yes">&#x201C;According to our class</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">they are treated from 1 month to 14 years old</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">so it is difficult to distinguish the pain of those who are less than 5 years old</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">There is a pain that you can see</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">that is</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">facial expression and you can identify it</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">On top of that</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">they are irritable</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">they cry</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">and there is something they show you when you touch them</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">They become disturbed mood</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">They feel discomfort and most babies express their pain by crying</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">The family will tell you how they feel</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">and you can replace the ones I mentioned above</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">we will give you pain relief from the smallest to the most severe&#x201D;</italic>. (P8, age 36)</p>
          </disp-quote>
          <p>On the other way in this study few nurses were described, using a tool for assessing pediatric pain but it is not routine. A 39-year-old female respondent stated, <italic toggle="yes">&#x201C;We have an assessment tool</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">As for the children</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">we have different sections for children and adults</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">In pediatrics</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">we classify pain as no pain</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">mild</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">moderate</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">and severe; we will group the moderate and severe special ones separately</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">The reason is that we treat children with moderate pain with a high dose</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">This has its level of pain distribution</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">Painless 0</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">mild 1&#x2013;3</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">moderate and high 4&#x2013;10</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">these are aggregated to give their ranking&#x201D;</italic>. (P2, Age 39)</p>
          <p><italic toggle="yes">Sub-theme 2</italic>: <italic toggle="yes">Inadequate knowledge of pain management practice</italic>. Several nurses described that pain management philosophy is starting from weak opoids. As they stated, the rationale for this approach was to avoid complications such as over-sedation or respiratory depression. In addition, participants reported that children are not similar to adults so being a child is a major barrier for effective management because they do not recognize and report their pain.</p>
          <p>Similarly, many nurses described that we use cold compress unless we are not using other non-pharmacological pain management to relieve pain. Many of the in-depth interviewees mentioned that there was managed pain simply by observing the severity of their pain but the level of pain score was not measured by specific tools appropriately due to this, the patient was not treated properly according to the degree of pain.</p>

          <p>The non-pharmacological treatment is one of the psychological supports to relieve pain by creating a favorable environment.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Nurses have a crucial role in the assessment, management, and alleviation of patients&#x2019; pain. In this study 216(53.6%) (CI- 48.4, 58.3) nurses had good practice regarding the pain management of children. This result is in line with the study in Turkey (54.5%) of study participants used a combination of pharmacological and non-pharmacological methods to relieve pain in children, in Ghana (57.8%) nurses had good pediatric pain management practices, in black lion hospitals (52.7%) and also the result observed in Mekelle city public hospitals, Ethiopia (55,8%) [<xref rid="pone.0300853.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0300853.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0300853.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The possible reasons for this discrepancy might be due to differences in knowledge and differences in familiarity with pain management tools and protocols because Ghana nurses have relatively good knowledge about pediatric pain management. In addition, they were familiar with pain assessment and management tools as compared to our country.</p>
      <p>There is evidence reported that nurses having good knowledge had good practice regarding pain management for hospitalized children compared to their counterparts [<xref rid="pone.0300853.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In addition, the current study included almost all wards from each hospital but the study in black lion hospital was conducted only from the pediatrics unit [<xref rid="pone.0300853.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The finding of this study was higher than the study conducted in Jimma Hospital in that the overall level of nurses&#x2019; pain management practice was (36.6%) [<xref rid="pone.0300853.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and study in Amhara region referral hospital showed that (45.7%) had good practice [<xref rid="pone.0300853.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This discrepancy might be due to nurse&#x2019;s commitment to applying the theoretical knowledge into actual practice due to a new initiative launched by Federal Ministry Of Health (FMOH) in recent times to create pain-free hospital initiatives so the nurses considered pain as the fifth vital sign to focus on pain management practice compared to previous study. This study is also relatively lower than the result conducted in Bahir Dar city HCPS showed that (60.6%) of HCPs had good practice [<xref rid="pone.0300853.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This discrepancy might be due to the study participants&#x2019; variation, the previous study participants were all healthcare professionals including physicians, but in this study, the study participants were only nurses. Other possible reasons for the contrary might be due to the difference in the size of the study samples and the number of hospitals included in the study.</p>
      <p>In this study, nurses who qualified in BSC pediatrics and child health nursing had a higher practice level on pain management for hospitalized children than those nurses who qualified in the diploma level. This finding was similar to a study in an Australian pediatric hospital showed that nurses with specialist pediatric qualifications had significantly better practice scores than other nurses. Similarly, our finding was comparable with the study conducted in Hawassa university referral hospital, where nurses who had a degree and above practiced 1.9 times more pain assessment and management than diploma nurses [<xref rid="pone.0300853.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0300853.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This might be due to pediatrics professionals having better knowledge and practice because they learn only pediatrics health and treat only children than other professionals.</p>
      <p>This study is also supported by qualitative findings of this study (theme 3, participant 8), some participants reported that there are limited experts qualified in child health due to that it&#x2019;s difficult to say that proper treatment is given by other professions.</p>
      <p>On the contrary, a study done in Ghana revealed that critical care nurses were about 5.87 times more likely to engage in good practices compared to pediatric nurses regarding pain management whereas bachelor&#x2019;s degree and diploma holders were 10 and 8 times, respectively, more likely to engage in good practices compared to master&#x2019;s degree holders [<xref rid="pone.0300853.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This inconsistency might be due to the difference in attending standard training and education on pediatric pain management, which means that in the study conducted in Ghana participants were more trained about pain management for hospitalized children as compared to the current study which helps them to enhance practice towards pediatrics pain management. Nurses who attended standard training regarding pain management have good practice as compared to their counterparts. These differences might be due to their frequent exposure to the management of children&#x2019;s pain because those nurses usually worked at the pediatrics unit, they develop better knowledge and practice than others do.</p>
      <p>Nurses who had 2&#x2013;5 years and 5&#x2013;10 years of experience in the pediatrics unit were 1.9 times and 5.4 times more likely able to practice pediatrics pain management compared to those nurses who had less than two years of experience in the pediatrics unit respectively. This finding is supported by a study conducted in Hawassa university referral hospital, who had nine and above years of service and were 2.35 times more likely in pain assessment and management than those service years less than nine years [<xref rid="pone.0300853.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This is due to experienced nurses were tending to provide more accurate pain management because experiences make them more skillful at interpreting pain scores and their management. As well as more experienced professionals become acculturated into the role of a profession, perceptions of pain, and practice of pain management.</p>
      <p>In this study, nurses who had good knowledge of pain management were nearly four times more likely able to practice pain management for hospitalized children than those who had poor knowledge of pain management. This result was in line with the study done in England, which showed that nurses who had good knowledge of pediatric pain management had effective pain management practices as compared to their counterparts, a study in Malaysia showed that nurses who had good knowledge of pain management had a significant positive relationship with pediatrics pain management practice in Amhara region, Ethiopia showed nurses who had adequate knowledge was 2.7 times more likely to practice proper pain management for hospitalized children than those who had inadequate knowledge [<xref rid="pone.0300853.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0300853.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0300853.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This study finding is also supported by qualitative findings most of the participants reported that lack of knowledge due to this we are not using the assessment tool, they overlook pain assessment tools some participants do not know there is a pain assessment tool specifically in children so this affects to practice effectively. Similarly, most of the participants reported that assessing a child&#x2019;s pain is difficult because they cannot express their feelings like adults so it needs special skills and knowledge to assess the Child&#x2019;s pain but this is a big challenge. This result implies that a nurse&#x2019;s knowledge can affect his or her ability to provide children&#x2019;s pain management adequately and nurses who have adequate knowledge assertively practice pain management</p>
      <p>In this study, nurses who had favorable attitudes toward pain management were 3 times more likely to practice pain management for hospitalized children than those who had unfavorable attitudes. This study finding was in line with the study done in Jordanian public hospitals, where nurses who had favorable attitudes towards pain management had a significant positive relationship with their pain management practices, Study in England many nurses have negative attitudes towards pain, and pain management in pediatric populations leads to delayed administration of analgesia or none at all and study in Amhara region, Ethiopia showed nurses who had favorable attitude towards pain management were 2.3 times more likely able to practice pain management for hospitalized children than those had unfavorable attitude [<xref rid="pone.0300853.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0300853.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0300853.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The possible explanation might be those nurses who were interested in their profession and perceived the child pain suffering was enhancing pain management practice.</p>
      <p>This study showed that a lack of in-service training for nurses is another factor that negatively affects good practice of pain management for hospitalized children. This finding is consistent with study findings from New Zealand, Amhara region Ethiopia, Debre Tabor hospital Ethiopia, and another study in Bahir Dar City showed that a lack of in-service training for nurses is a factor that affects proper pain management practice for hospitalized children [<xref rid="pone.0300853.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0300853.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0300853.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The possible explanation is that non-trained health professionals did not achieve their competency in providing safe, high-quality, health services to clients through improved work performance. This is because through training different types of skills/practice are taught, including psychomotor skills, clinical decision-making skills, and communication skills. Therefore, trained health professionals in quality improvement have the potential to impact positively on attitudes, knowledge, and practice of pain management. This finding was also supported by our qualitative findings (theme 3, participant 2) showed that many of the study participants reported that lack of training was a major barrier to proper pain management practice.</p>
      <p>Qualitatively the finding of this study (theme 3, participant 8) showed that more than half of nurses explained that family beliefs and misconceptions are factors that influence the management of pain so our society&#x2019;s knowledge, thinking, and culture influence us to give appropriate treatment. Some participants explained that especially if the child is febrile, they say it is an &#x201C;evil eye&#x201D; Due to this they wanted to go to traditional medicine houses. Similarly, the majority of nurses reported that the economic status of the family affects our treatment this is due to some anti-pain drugs like morphine and others are not always avail inside the hospital at that time they cannot afford to buy drugs outside the hospital. This study was in line with studies conducted in Europe, some clinicians stated that younger children were more difficult to assess and manage [<xref rid="pone.0300853.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In London, nurses felt that parents exaggerate their child&#x2019;s pain and ask for analgesic drugs before their child needs them. Children and parents do not inform nurses when they/their child are in pain as a barrier [<xref rid="pone.0300853.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In Canada, Inadequate patient communication with the health professional, pain experiences, and language barriers are factors in pediatric pain management [<xref rid="pone.0300853.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. At Auckland University of Technology, Parents can challenge the decisions of health professionals [<xref rid="pone.0300853.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p>
      <p>Similarly, the qualitative finding of this study showed that inadequate professional commitment and satisfaction of nurses were factors for proper pain management. Some participants said that lack of professional interest; professionals delaying decisions and some physicians not accepting the assessment scale or grading affect proper management. In addition, a few nurses stated that nurses attributed the delay in nursing intervention, improper caregiving, not giving timely pain relief drugs, and delay in pain diagnosis and control due to the late presence of nurses and doctors at the patient&#x2019;s bedside. This study finding is supported by a study conducted at a UK children&#x2019;s hospital [<xref rid="pone.0300853.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p>

        <title>Strength</title>
        <p>This study used a mixed study design to assess the pain management practice of nurses, so applying quantitative as well as qualitative (to explore the factors not addressed by the quantitative study) might improve the quality.</p>

      <sec id="sec051">
        <title>Limitation</title>
        <p>The study did not observe the actual practices of health care professionals&#x2019; assessment and management of pain in children due to the self-reporting nature of the questionnaire the finding of this study might be influenced by subject response bias this is because of time and financial constraints.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>Only half of the participants had good practice in pediatrics pain management. Knowledge, attitude, nurses qualified in BSC pediatrics and child health, years of experience in the pediatrics department, getting pain management training were associated with the practice of pain management. From the qualitative findings, the availability of anti-pain drugs, lack of training, lack of assessment tools, lack of updated protocols, shortage of resources, lack of continuous monitoring and evaluation, and others were the barriers to proper pain management. This study concludes that applying effective pain management practices to hospitalized children remains a challenge. Therefore, it is better to put further effort towards improving pediatric pain management practice.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec053">
      <title>Recommendation</title>
      <p>Both qualitative and qualitative findings confirmed that lack of training in pediatric pain management, no having of a protocol for pediatric pain management at institutions, a lack of availability of anti-pain drugs, nurse&#x2019;s workload, lack of availability of pain assessment tools, and no designated area and material for pain management contributes to low level of pain management practice of nurses. Based on the findings of this study the following recommendations are forwarded: -</p>

      <p>Dear Dr. yigzaw,</p>
      <p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE&#x2019;s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p>
      <p>We had one only reviewer with minor suggestions, which I agree and&#xA0; consider enough&#xA0; if you can do the revision and submit for a final decision.&#xA0; Please make a revision on the writting, preferently by a native speaking person,&#xA0;which will also improve the manuscript.&#xA0;<!-- </div> --><!-- <div> --></p>
      <p>Please submit your revised manuscript by Apr 06 2024 11:59PM. If you will need more time than this to complete your revisions, please reply to this message or contact the journal office at&#xA0;<email>plosone@plos.org</email>. When you're ready to submit your revision, log on to <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/</ext-link> and select the 'Submissions Needing Revision' folder to locate your manuscript file.</p>
      <p>Please include the following items when submitting your revised manuscript:<!-- </div> --><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>A rebuttal letter that responds to each point raised by the academic editor and reviewer(s). You should upload this letter as a separate file labeled 'Response to Reviewers'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A marked-up copy of your manuscript that highlights changes made to the original version. You should upload this as a separate file labeled 'Revised Manuscript with Track Changes'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>An unmarked version of your revised paper without tracked changes. You should upload this as a separate file labeled 'Manuscript'.</p></list-item></list><!-- <div> -->If you would like to make changes to your financial disclosure, please include your updated statement in your cover letter. Guidelines for resubmitting your figure files are available below the reviewer comments at the end of this letter.</p>
      <p>If applicable, we recommend that you deposit your laboratory protocols in protocols.io to enhance the reproducibility of your results. Protocols.io assigns your protocol its own identifier (DOI) so that it can be cited independently in the future. For instructions see: <ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-laboratory-protocols" ext-link-type="uri">https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-laboratory-protocols</ext-link>. Additionally, PLOS ONE offers an option for publishing peer-reviewed Lab Protocol articles, which describe protocols hosted on protocols.io.

<bold>Comments to the Author</bold>
</p>
      <p>1. Is the manuscript technically sound, and do the data support the conclusions?</p>
      <p>The manuscript must describe a technically sound piece of scientific research with data that supports the conclusions. Experiments must have been conducted rigorously, with appropriate controls, replication, and sample sizes. The conclusions must be drawn appropriately based on the data presented. <!-- </font> --></p>

      <p>Reviewer #1:&#xA0;Dear Author,</p>
      <p>This mixed method study which aimed to assess practice and factors associated with pediatric pain management among nurses working in Bahir Darcity public hospitals is well designed and performed, only some suggestions are listed below:</p>
      <p>- Title: the title is too long and it could be most clear for readers. Suggestion: "Practice and Factors Associated with Pediatrics Pain Management among Nurses Working in Bahir Dar City Public Hospitals: a mixed method study";</p>
      <p>- Introduction: this section is too long. It is suggested that the main topoics related to the theme developed in the study should be exposed. It is suggested that lines 69-92 from page 4 and line 98 -107 from page 5 should be removed, once there is a subjetive information not directly related to the theme;</p>
      <p>- Materials and Methods: On this topic, there is also superficial information that must be removed. Information about the cities presented on lines 151-165 from page 7-8, is not necessary to be written in this paper. In this same way, detalis about the sample size calculator explained on page 8, is not necesssary to be in this section;</p>
      <p>Based on the aspects analyzed and listed above, this paper should be minor revised for publication on PlosOne.</p>
      <p>Best regards</p>
