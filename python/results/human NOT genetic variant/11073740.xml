In this study, the gut microbiota of postparturient dams was compared with that of their offspring in three Finnish pig farms at three growth phases. The differences in fecal microbiota of three study development groups (Good, Poorly, and PrematureDeath) were analyzed at birth (initial exposure phase), weaning (transitional phase), and before slaughter (stable phase). Dam <italic toggle="yes">Lactobacillaceae</italic> abundance was lower than in piglets at birth. <italic toggle="yes">Limosilactobacillus reuteri</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Lactobacillus amylovorus</italic> were dominantly expressed in dams and their offspring. Altogether 17 piglets (68%) were identified with <italic toggle="yes">Lactobacillaceae</italic> at the initial exposure phase, divided unevenly among the development groups: 85% of Good, 37.5% of Poorly, and 75% of PrematureDeath pigs. The development group Good was identified with the highest microbial diversity, whereas the development group PrematureDeath had the lowest diversity. After weaning, the abundance and versatility of <italic toggle="yes">Lactobacillaceae</italic> in piglets diminished, shifting towards the microbiome of the dam. In conclusion, the fecal microbiota of pigs tends to develop towards a similar alpha and beta diversity despite development group and rearing environment.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source>

      <p>Microbial research in pigs has focused mainly on improving feed efficiency and animal growth or improving herd health [<xref rid="pone.0302724.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Whether there are differences in fecal microbiota related to the growth of pigs throughout their lives is not known. Our aim was to investigate the development of the pig gut microbiota from birth to slaughter in the following three development groups: Good, Poorly, and PrematureDeath pigs. Pigs were sampled at birth and again around weaning, and in the development groups Good and Poorly also prior to slaughter. We hypothesized that the fecal microbiota would differ between the development groups and sampling times and that the development group Good would have a richer and more diverse microbiota than the other two development groups. Secondly, we aimed to compare the gut microbiota of dams after parturition with that of their offspring throughout the piglets&#x2019; lives. We hypothesized that differences would exist between the three development groups already in the fecal microbiota of their dams soon after parturition.</p>

        <p>Three commercial piglet producing farms and their corresponding finishing farms (Farms 1&#x2013;3) from south and southwestern Finland took part in this study. Piglet producing farms 1&#x2013;3 had 1000, 1100, and 1271 crossbred Yorkshire*Landrace sows, respectively. (<xref rid="pone.0302724.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref> in supporting information shows detailed sow production numbers). Sows were inseminated with Duroc semen to produce three-breed piglet crosses. Each piglet producing farm delivered their piglets to two corresponding finishing farms with 2200 and 2300, 1100 and 3500, and 1500 and 1700 crossbred Yorkshire*Landrace*Duroc pigs for Farms 1&#x2013;3 respectively.</p>
        <p>Piglets were housed during lactation with their dams in farrowing pens (about 4.5 m<sup>2</sup>), with partly slatted floors, and the dams in farrowing crates. No bedding was offered to piglets in the farrowing units, except for Farm 3, which provided piglets with a covered creep area with sawdust bedding. Dams received a small amount of straw before parturition. Between batches, pens were pressure washed, but when occupied by sows and piglets, the piglets had contact with dam fecal matter. Cross-fostering of piglets was managed by the caretakers and commonly practiced on the study farms to achieve suitable litter compositions and sizes for the sows and to assure that all piglets received milk.</p>
        <p>After weaning at approximately four weeks of age, piglets were moved into the weaning unit on the same farm. Groups of approximately 20 piglets per pen were housed together in the weaning unit. At around ten weeks of age, the pigs were moved to the finishing farms and kept in pens in groups of 20&#x2013;25 pigs. In the weaning and finishing units, pens had partly slatted floors and a long feeding trough, and the pigs had a space allowance of about 0.4 m<sup>2</sup> for weaned pigs and 0.9 m<sup>2</sup> for finishing pigs. Chains and/or pieces of wood were provided for enrichment in both weaning and finishing units on all farms. When pigs were moved to new pens, sawdust was introduced. Thereafter, small amounts of sawdust, straw, or peat were added by caretakers.</p>
        <p>All pigs were fed according to Finnish standards without any added microbes (Immonen, personal communication). On all farms homegrown grains (barley, wheat, oats) were mixed with a commercial protein source (barley-based protein feed or soy) and concentrate feed. All except suckling piglets were liquid fed and a mix of organic acids with a formic acid base was added to the liquid feed mixture for preservation. In addition to sow milk, suckling piglets received commercial feed, which was heat-treated (81&#xB0;C) to eliminate possible contamination of feed and ensure the safety of piglets. Male pigs were surgically castrated during their first week of life and received pain medication intramuscularly after castration. Pigs were not tail docked, nor were their teeth clipped or ground. No routine antimicrobials were used. All management procedures on the farms were performed by caretakers according to farm practice. Study pigs were housed together with non-study pigs throughout their lives.</p>

        <p>During the follow-up time, the pigs were checked five times on the farms. <xref rid="pone.0302724.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref> shows what data was recorded, collected, and evaluated from each check-up. The first check-up was during the initial exposure phase, when the piglets were 2&#x2013;6 days old. During the birth week, the piglets were weighed, piglet feces samples were taken and the information on medication of dams and piglets were collected. The second check-up was during the transitional phase, when the piglets were 23&#x2013;42 days old. At this point, piglet medication information and feces samples were collected. During the third and fourth check-ups, when the pigs were 64&#x2013;83 and 99&#x2013;123 days old, respectively, piglet medication information was collected. The final check-up was during the stable phase when the pigs were 133&#x2013;149 days old. The last fecal sample was collected along with medication information. The pigs were slaughtered at 150&#x2013;191 days of age. At slaughter, carcass weight and routine meat inspection (MI) information, such as recorded findings of joint inflammation, abscesses, pneumonia, tail biting, or liver diseases, were collected. A more detailed description of timing and purpose of each check-up is presented in <xref rid="pone.0302724.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>.</p>
        <p>All collected information on the pigs was used to create criteria for retrospectively forming three development groups and selecting samples for further analysis (<xref rid="pone.0302724.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In total, 25 pigs from 24 litters met the criteria; 13 pigs were assigned to development group Good, 8 to development group Poorly, and 4 to development group PrematureDeath. The pigs from development group PrematureDeath died at the ages of 2, 28, 59, and 69 days. One pig died due to diarrhea; for the other three pigs, the reason for death is unknown.</p>

        <p>For organizational and biosecurity reasons, the pigs could not be sampled on exactly the same dates. Therefore, sampling dates are referred to as phases based on the microbiota development phase to which they correspond (<xref rid="pone.0302724.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). The age of the pigs at each phase is shown in <xref rid="pone.0302724.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>. Fecal samples were collected from each pig three times: initial exposure phase, transitional phase, and stable phase (<xref rid="pone.0302724.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). Transitional phase samples were collected during extensive dietary change from lactation to solid feed just after weaning. For three study pigs (12%; <xref rid="pone.0302724.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>: Poorly8, PrematureDeath2, and PrematureDeath3), the samples in the transitional phase were collected before weaning. Stable phase samples were collected after microbial development was expected to have stabilized at the end of the finishing period. Dam samples were collected at the same time as piglet samples in the initial exposure phase.</p>

        <title>Data collection</title>
        <p>The study pigs were weighed during their birth week and at slaughter to calculate an average daily gain (ADG) for the whole growing period (<xref rid="pone.0302724.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Caretakers were asked to keep records of medications on separate forms prepared by the researchers. During each check-up, researchers collected the forms (<xref rid="pone.0302724.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). Additionally, all pigs on all farms had extra ear-tags that were removed once a pig received an antimicrobial treatment course. The researchers checked the information from the collected medication forms with information on these ear-tags. Also dam medication data from three days prior to parturition were collected from farm records. Finally, MI information was obtained from the slaughterhouse.</p>
        <p>All fecal samples were collected straight from the rectum with factory clean disposable vinyl gloves. Sterile cotton swabs were used to help collecting fecal samples from small piglets. Samples were placed immediately in sampling tubes, and the tubes were put in a Styrofoam box on ice bricks. The box was emptied every two hours into a -18&#xB0;C freezer. The samples were transported in a freezer to the University of Helsinki laboratory within 24 hours and stored at -80&#xB0;C until analysis.</p>

        <p>Fecal <italic toggle="yes">Lactobacillaceae</italic> abundance was determined as described elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0302724.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Briefly, ten-fold dilutions of fecal samples were plated on blood liver (BL) agar (Nissui Pharmaceutical, Tokyo, Japan). Non-identical colonies were chosen to be incubated in Gifu Anaerobic Medium Broth (GAM broth; Nissui Pharmaceutical, Tokyo, Japan). The DNA of non-motile rod-shaped bacteria was isolated, and a colony PCR and a 16S PCR were used to identify <italic toggle="yes">Lactobacillaceae</italic>. Species were identified with 96% homology, comparing sequences with the National Center for Biotechnology Information&#x2019;s (NCBI) Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) database.</p>
        <p>Fecal microbiota profiling was performed by use of the 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing as follows: Fecal samples (0.100&#x2013;0.125 g) were weighed into 2 ml screw cap tubes, and InviMag&#xAE; Stool DNA Kit (Invitek Molecular GmbH, Berlin, Germany) was used according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions for performing microbiota analysis. For the extraction, we used a FastPrep&#xAE;-24 Sample Preparation System (M.P. Biomedical, Irvine, CA, USA), a Heraeus Pico 17 Centrifuge (Thermo Fisher Scientific Ltd., Osterode am Harz, Germany), and a KingFisher&#x2122; Purification System Type 700 (Thermo Fisher Scientific Ltd., Vantaa, Finland). A NanoDrop 2000 UV-Vis Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Ltd., Wilmington, DE, USA) was used to measure the DNA concentration of eluates.</p>
        <p>To normalize DNA concentration for the library run, the concentration was measured with a Qubit&#xAE; 2.0 Fluorometer (Life Technology, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The V3-V4 variable regions of the 16S rRNA gene were amplified with primers selected from Klindworth and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0302724.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] to perform the libraries as described elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0302724.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. With the NextEra XT Index Kit (FC-131-2001) (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), a multiplexing step was conducted and a Bioanalyzer DNA 1000 chip (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) was used to measure the DNA quality of the library PCR product and to verify the size (expectation of Bioanalyzer trace is ~550 bp). A 2 x 300 bp paired-end run on MiSeq Illumina platform was performed according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions to sequence the libraries. The sequences were pre-processed by customizing an established workflow [<xref rid="pone.0302724.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] with the DADA2 [<xref rid="pone.0302724.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] algorithm (R package dada2 [<xref rid="pone.0302724.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]). Quality plots were manually investigated, and the sequences were truncated (forward 260; reverse 210) and trimmed from the left (base 19). Reads were discarded if they had more than two expected errors. Default settings were used otherwise. Chimeric sequences were removed. From the processed sequences, the Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs) were inferred and taxonomically assigned against the Silva database (v. 138.1) [<xref rid="pone.0302724.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study, piglets at birth were identified with higher <italic toggle="yes">Lactobacillaceae</italic> abundance than their dams. As <italic toggle="yes">Lactobacillaceae</italic> are among the first early life microbes and have been shown to be the most abundant group of bacteria in pigs during the first three weeks of life [<xref rid="pone.0302724.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. <italic toggle="yes">Lactobacillaceae</italic> are mainly associated with maternal exposure [<xref rid="pone.0302724.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], it is interesting that only 7 (29%) of the dams were identified with <italic toggle="yes">Lactobacillaceae</italic>. Although unexpected, this is in line with the results of Berry and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0302724.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] who reported numerous <italic toggle="yes">Lactobacillaceae</italic> species in piglets but none in sows. Of the seven sows identified with <italic toggle="yes">Lactobacillaceae</italic> in this study, five had mutual <italic toggle="yes">Lactobacillaceae</italic> with their offspring, mainly <italic toggle="yes">L</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">amylovorus</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">L</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">reuteri</italic>. These piglets were equipped with covered creep areas with sawdust bedding, keeping them warm in the farrowing pens and possibly facilitating microbiome development [<xref rid="pone.0302724.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. At lower environmental temperatures, overall alpha diversity has been shown to decrease and certain gut species become undetectable in several animal species, including swine [<xref rid="pone.0302724.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In sows, as in other maternal individuals across animal species, fecal microbial alpha diversity typically increases during pregnancy and until weaning, ensuring sufficient nutrient supply to the offspring during pregnancy and lactation [<xref rid="pone.0302724.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0302724.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0302724.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Although the transfer of culturable <italic toggle="yes">Lactobacillaceae</italic> to piglets appeared fairly low in this study, the abundance of <italic toggle="yes">Lactobacillaceae</italic> in piglets was at its peak in the initial exposure phase. <italic toggle="yes">Lactobacillaceae</italic> are a core part of host health and have the ability to balance the intestinal microbiota via competitive exclusion [<xref rid="pone.0302724.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0302724.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0302724.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Chen and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0302724.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] speculated these early settlers to pave the road for sow&#x2019;s fecal microbiota to colonize the newborn piglet&#x2019;s gut. Chen and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0302724.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] also reported microbiota in sow milk, the nipple surface, and slatted floors to tend to be similar to the piglet fecal microbiota. Most of the neonate piglets in our study experienced cross-fostering during the first days of life to have access to sufficient milk. Cross-fostering has been suggested to alter the neonate microbiome in cross-fostered siblings [<xref rid="pone.0302724.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0302724.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and to elicit differences in their immune status and colonic microbiota [<xref rid="pone.0302724.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Our study seems to support this as cross-fostered pigs expressed fewer species of <italic toggle="yes">Lactobacillaceae</italic> throughout their lives compared to non-cross-fostered individuals.</p>
      <p>Altogether 17 piglets (68%) were identified with <italic toggle="yes">Lactobacillaceae</italic> at the initial exposure phase, divided unevenly among the development groups: 85% of Good, 37.5% of Poorly, and 75% of PrematureDeath pigs. The development group Good appeared to have more <italic toggle="yes">Lactobacillaceae</italic> diversity than the other two development groups. Of the dam-piglet paired <italic toggle="yes">Lactobacillaceae</italic> abundance, <italic toggle="yes">L</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">reuteri</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">L</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">amylovorus</italic> were the most prevalent in the development group Good. Contrary to our results, Morissette and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0302724.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] described high weight gain piglets to have lower proportions of <italic toggle="yes">L</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">amylovorus</italic> during the first two weeks of lactation than low weight gain piglets. This may be due to geographic differences in pig rearing, feed, and the environment may impact on the selection of the microbial diversity and therefore effect the abundancy of <italic toggle="yes">L</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">amylovorus</italic>. The high weight gain is thought to be linked to higher colostrum and milk intake, which is reported to affect the gut microbiome development [<xref rid="pone.0302724.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In this study, during lactation, <italic toggle="yes">L</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">reuteri</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">L</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">amylovorus</italic> were detected in all development groups.</p>
      <p>The number and diversity of <italic toggle="yes">Lactobacillaceae</italic> decreased in piglets between birth and weaning. <italic toggle="yes">Lactobacillaceae</italic> changes were seen in <italic toggle="yes">L</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">mucosae</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">L</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">murinus</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">L</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">urinamulieris</italic> being outgrown by <italic toggle="yes">L</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">acidophilus</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">L</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">oris</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">L</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">pontis</italic>. Cheng and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0302724.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] as well as Gaukroger and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0302724.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] reported the level of microbial diversity to be the lowest at the beginning of lactation on day 3, seen also in this study. <italic toggle="yes">Lactobacillaceae</italic> diversity and abundance were highest in the development group Good. In the development group Poorly, pigs with MI findings were medicated or their dams had been medicated prior to birth. Sow and pig medication also appeared to affect <italic toggle="yes">Lactobacillaceae</italic> diversity in PrematureDeath pigs. This indicates the negative effect of sow and piglet medication or their need to be medicated on development of the piglet microbiome. Piglets with low early life microbial abundance are likely to miss pivotal developmental windows [<xref rid="pone.0302724.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Also, instability of the microbiota during early life renders the community structure of microbiota during this time more sensitive to environmental incursions [<xref rid="pone.0302724.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] related to adulthood health and lifespan together with early life nutrition [<xref rid="pone.0302724.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p>
      <p>After weaning, the abundance and versatility of <italic toggle="yes">Lactobacillaceae</italic> in piglets decreased. This phenomenon is seen in total fecal microbiota as well, where piglet fecal microbiota starts to resemble dam fecal microbiota. The maternal innate effect influencing the piglet fecal microbiota has been reported to diminish after the first 93 days [<xref rid="pone.0302724.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The same group reported microbial richness and diversity to decrease towards the end of the finishing period [<xref rid="pone.0302724.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Age groups differed more from each other than from groups on different farms [<xref rid="pone.0302724.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In this study, <italic toggle="yes">L</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">amylovorus</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">L</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">reuteri</italic> were most abundant at the age of 6 months regardless of the development group. Similar growth environments between farms appear to shape pig fecal microbiota composition within an age group. In addition, the microbiome is affected by co-habitants [<xref rid="pone.0302724.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0302724.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Individuals receive and share microbes, both beneficial and pathogenic, with their frequent co-habitants [<xref rid="pone.0302724.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0302724.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], highlighting the importance of a healthy microbiome throughout the herd. Transplantation of gut microbiota can result in transfer of a disease phenotype [<xref rid="pone.0302724.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], leading to speculation about whether a medication-originated dysbiosis affects co-habitants through transferring pathogens. Nowland and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0302724.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] found piglet microbial development and piglet growth to be improved by removing sow feces from the pen. In this study, the sows and piglets were in continuous contact with sows fecal matter while occupying pens. The rearing environment of pigs does not seem to support diversity, as the conditions are standardized for pigs to develop in a similar way. Feeding, medication, rearing environment, and use of enrichment are fairly similar on all farms. This makes large-scale production easier and the product more uniform but might pose challenges for the development of a diverse gut microbiota.</p>
      <p>In our study, total microbial diversity and richness were higher and remained stable during the finishing period, consistent with reports by Knecht and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0302724.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and Le Sciellour and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0302724.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Pigs in the development group Good expressed a healthy microbial colonization and did not require medication during their lives, nor did they have MI findings after slaughter. The development group Poorly showed stable but slow development of gut microbial diversity. The high microbial diversity close to slaughter age exceeds the level of the development group Good. Of the four pigs with MI findings in the development group Poorly, three pigs received medication and one pig had a medicated dam. These findings suggest a link between medication, gut microbiota, and reduced health.</p>
      <p>A limiting factor for this study was the small sample size. In addition, intensive cross-fostering within a few days of birth complicated the comparison of microbial development. Cross-fostering transiently reshapes preweaning colon microbiota and immune status [<xref rid="pone.0302724.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], and it brings a major confounding element to the study. Also, dietary details were not available. The commercial feed did not contain added microbes, but differences may have been present in feed composition between farms. However, early-life microbiome, including <italic toggle="yes">Lactobacillaceae</italic>, received from the dam shapes the core microbiome of pigs. When undisturbed, the diversity of the core microbiome remains throughout the animal&#x2019;s life. However, diet and the environment influence the microbiota in short term. In this study, pigs received the same diet throughout each farm and therefore the effect on the microbiome is constant.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>Piglets at birth were identified with thirteen different <italic toggle="yes">Lactobacillaceae</italic> species and with higher <italic toggle="yes">Lactobacillaceae</italic> diversity and abundance than in their dams. Of the seven sows identified with <italic toggle="yes">Lactobacillaceae</italic>, five had mutual <italic toggle="yes">Lactobacillaceae</italic> with their offspring, mainly <italic toggle="yes">L</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">amylovorus</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">L</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">reuteri</italic>. Pigs in the development group Good were not medicated and had no MI findings. These pigs expressed higher relative abundance of <italic toggle="yes">Lactobacillaceae</italic> during the initial exposure phase than pigs growing poorly or dying prematurely. In the development group Good, more diversity in total microbiota between birth and weaning was recorded, indicating that these pigs expressed healthy microbial colonization. Nevertheless, a similar fecal microbial development was seen in alpha and beta diversity of the pigs, regardless of the pig&#x2019;s development group or rearing farm.</p>

      <p>Dear Dr. K&#xF6;nig,</p>
      <p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE&#x2019;s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p>
      <p>Please provide much more details about the experiment to allow the reviewers to determine if the data is appropriately sound for publication in PloS one. Make sure to address all comments exhaustively.&#xA0;</p>
      <p>Please submit your revised manuscript by Mar 30 2024 11:59PM. If you will need more time than this to complete your revisions, please reply to this message or contact the journal office at&#xA0;<email>plosone@plos.org</email>. When you're ready to submit your revision, log on to <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/</ext-link> and select the 'Submissions Needing Revision' folder to locate your manuscript file.</p>
      <p>Please include the following items when submitting your revised manuscript:<!-- </div> --><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>A rebuttal letter that responds to each point raised by the academic editor and reviewer(s). You should upload this letter as a separate file labeled 'Response to Reviewers'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A marked-up copy of your manuscript that highlights changes made to the original version. You should upload this as a separate file labeled 'Revised Manuscript with Track Changes'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>An unmarked version of your revised paper without tracked changes.

      <p>Reviewer #1:&#xA0;The manuscript attempts to describe an evaluation of microbial diversity in growing pigs with different growth performance. However, there are many shortcomings with the manuscript that need to be addressed and considered before further evaluation of the manuscript.</p>
      <p>Lines 50-102: The Introduction should be shortened, targeted, and concluded with focused objective statements.</p>
      <p>Lines 61-65: should be moved to Discussion</p>
      <p>Lines 76-84: should be moved to Discussion</p>
      <p>Line 118: How many piglets per site? What were the sow production numbers (e.g. total born, still born)?</p>
      <p>Line 127: How far were piglets transported?</p>
      <p>Line 128: How many total pens in the weaning and finishing units?</p>
      <p>Line 129: Did one weaning unit house all the pigs?</p>
      <p>Line 129: Were the finishing farm groups similar to the weaning unit groups or completely random?</p>
      <p>Line 137: Was feed tested for microbial contribution to the results?</p>
      <p>Line 138: What was the method and purpose of heat treatment?</p>
      <p>Line 147: Is it correct that only ~5 piglets were born to each sow? Further on, only 25 piglets are considered, so the discrepancy must be explained.</p>
      <p>Line 148: How were pigs selected and identified?</p>
      <p>Line 150: What time points were evaluated?</p>
      <p>Line 151: Birth weight and current weight?</p>
      <p>Line 152: Were pigs selected for and marketed based on days on feed or body weight?</p>
      <p>Line 154: Provide some (not all) details in the text for the reader.</p>
      <p>Line 161: insert "during lactation" after "information"</p>
      <p>Line 162: delete "These criteria are summarized in"</p>
      <p>Line 163: Why were only these pigs selected?</p>
      <p>Line 163: Does that mean at least one pig from each litter?</p>
      <p>Line 165: When did these pigs die?</p>
      <p>Line 165: Did you confirm the reason was injury?</p>
      <p>Line 175: How are the sampling dates considered in the statistical analysis?</p>
      <p>Line 253: There is no indication how the potential influence of different farms was considered in the analysis. How was each farm tested as a separate block? How was parity influence considered? What are the performance metrics considered and how were they evaluated?</p>
      <p>Line 306: Was this pig considered in further analysis?</p>
      <p>Line 401: What are other probable sources?</p>
      <p>Line 418: Were any surfaces swabbed in this study? How were the rooms cleaned and disinfected before farrowing?</p>
      <p>Line 418: Why were cross-fostered pigs chosen and not excluded?</p>
      <p>Line 444: Why were medicated pigs chosen and not excluded?</p>
      <p>Lines 486-487: This is a major shortcoming of the manuscript. Diet composition is known to influence the microbiome. Lack of information such draws serious questions about the validity of the study results.</p>
      <p>Figures: All figures should include all the information needed to stand alone.</p>
      <p>Reviewer #2:&#xA0;Author studied Fecal microbiota profiles of growing pigs and their relation to growth performance.</p>
      <p>Line 113: since there were only three farms, please note the number of sows and finisher pigs from each farm.</p>
      <p>Line 118 please provide the size of pen.</p>
      <p>Line 122 &#x201C;The pens were never completely clean.&#x201D;</p>
      <p>Were pens cleaned and disinfected before introducing the next group of sows?</p>
      <p>Were sows from all 3 farms received the straw before parturition?</p>
      <p>Line 123 What was the rule used for crossfoster?</p>
      <p>Line 132 to 135: Were these practices true for all 3 farms?</p>
      <p>Line 138: Is there scientific evidence that can confirm no probiotics are being added in any stage of production from all three farms? Since diets have greatly impacted the microbiomes of pigs, please provide diet compositions.</p>
      <p>Line 147: What were the pig's selection criteria? How many piglets per dam were selected? What is the dam distribution for each farm?</p>
      <p>Line 163: How was the gender distribution between the three categories and the number of pigs distributed from each farm?</p>
      <p>The number of observations for the Premature death group is very low. At which stage of production were these 4 pigs dead?</p>
      <p>Table 1: Please change &#x201C;&#xBD;*SD&#x201D; to &#x201C;1/2&#xD7;SD&#x201D;.</p>
      <p>Line 179: Were samples for the transitional phase occurring on the date of weaning? Please clarify.</p>
      <p>Table 2: Please provide units for noncategorical traits.</p>
      <p>Line 208: Swab samples were collected from pigs at younger ages, while fecal samples were used for older pigs. Please clarify what collection was made for each phase.</p>
      <p>Line 215: Does this indicate that only fecal samples were analyzed for Lactobacillaceae?</p>
      <p>Line 269: was crossfostering performed before sample collection for the initial exposure phase?</p>
      <p>For 25 pigs, how many of them were crossfostered?</p>
      <p>Line 277: What were the statistics analysis results?</p>
      <p>Line 307: How about good2?</p>
      <p>Line 310: Poor1 didn&#x2019;t express L. vaginalis.</p>
      <p>Line 334: Were results from those cross fostered differ from those were not? If there are, it indicated the evident of confounding effect. Was cross fostering also performed in the other farms?</p>
      <p>Line 373: Please provide the data in supplemental.</p>
      <p>Line 375: Since the different was only showed in initial exposure phase, it is no need to present Fig8a.</p>
      <p>Line 385: Please correct P=0.000. Also space should be available before and after equal sign, P = 0.000, and P should be italic.</p>
      <p>Please being consistent with &#x201C;development group&#x201D; throughout the whole document.</p>
      <p>Line 404: Was any of these five pigs Cross fostered? Were other piglets also express these two bacteria?</p>
      <p>Line 428: what is the explanation for the contrary observation?</p>

      <p>Reviewer comments:</p>
      <p>Reviewer #1: The manuscript attempts to describe an evaluation of microbial diversity in growing pigs with different growth performance. However, there are many shortcomings with the manuscript that need to be addressed and considered before further evaluation of the manuscript.</p>
      <p>Lines 50-102: The Introduction should be shortened, targeted, and concluded with focused objective statements.</p>
      <p>Response &#x2013; Thank you for the comment. The introduction has been revised and shortened.</p>
      <p>Lines 61-65: should be moved to Discussion</p>
      <p>Response &#x2013; We have considered this carefully, however, as our sampling times are based on the phases as described here, we feel that lines 61-65 is the appropriate place to introduce the microbial development phases. We think that the reader can get a better picture about the phases and suggest that we could leave this part in the introduction. </p>
      <p>Lines 76-84: should be moved to Discussion</p>
      <p>Response &#x2013; This paragraph has been removed and the remaining sentence in lines 80-83 has been combined to the previous paragraph. The remaining sentence serves as an introduction to Lactobacillaceae. </p>
      <p>Line 118: How many piglets per site? What were the sow production numbers (e.g. total born, still born)?</p>
      <p>Response &#x2013; The missing information has been added as Table S1 in the supporting information and referred to in lines 116-119.</p>
      <p>Line 127: How far were piglets transported?</p>
      <p>Response &#x2013; Weaning units were situated within the piglet producing farms. This has been clarified in lines 136-137 as follows &#x201C;After weaning at approximately four weeks of age, piglets were moved into the weaning unit on the same farm.&#x201D;</p>
      <p>Line 128: How many total pens in the weaning and finishing units?</p>
      <p>Response &#x2013; The corresponding two fattening farms for each piglet producing farm had space for 2200 and 2300 fatteners on Farm 1, on Farm 2 for 1100 and 3500 fatteners, and on Farm 3 for 1500 and 1700 fatteners. On finishing farms, the arriving pigs were grouped together with approximately 20 pigs per pen but as the pigs grew some pigs were moved to other pens to give the growing pigs more space. Towards the end of finishing there were less than 20 pigs in one pen. In average, throughout the finishing period there were 15 pigs in a pen, resulting the finishing farms having 147 and 154 pens for Farm 1, 74 and 234 pens for Farm 2, and 100 and 114 pens for Farm 3. With some additional empty pens were available for managing sick animals and possible overcrowding. </p>
      <p>Piglet producing farms 1-3 had approximately 96, 192, and 144 pens in the weaning units, respectively. Including some empty pens for sick animals etc.</p>
      <p>Line 129: Did one weaning unit house all the pigs?</p>
      <p>Response &#x2013; On each farm the weaning unit housed all the weaned pigs. The weaning units were a part of the piglet producing farm building. </p>
      <p>Line 129: Were the finishing farm groups similar to the weaning unit groups or completely random?</p>
      <p>Response &#x2013; Finishing farm groups were random, since caretakers mixed pigs into groups upon arrival.</p>
      <p>Line 137: Was feed tested for microbial contribution to the results?</p>
      <p>Response &#x2013; The farms are a part of slaughterhouse contract breeders with general feeding instructions. The feed formulation did not contain any added microbes and was therefore not tested in this study. A general diet composition has been added to the text in lines 147-150 as follows &#x201C;On all farms homegrown grains (barley, wheat, oats) were mixed with a commercial protein source (barley-based protein feed or soy) and concentrate feed. All except suckling piglets were liquid fed and a mix of organic acids with a formic acid base was added to the liquid feed mixture for preservation.&#x201D;</p>
      <p>Line 138: What was the method and purpose of heat treatment?</p>
      <p>Response &#x2013; First feed for suckling piglets is a commercial feed that is heat treated (heated to a minimum of 81 degrees) at the feed factory to eliminate possible contamination of feed and ensure the safety of piglets. A clarification has been added in line 151-152.</p>
      <p>Line 147: Is it correct that only ~5 piglets were born to each sow? Further on, only 25 piglets are considered, so the discrepancy must be explained.</p>
      <p>Response &#x2013; Thank you for the comment, this part was indeed written very confusingly, we apologize for that. On average 13.4 (Farm 1), 18.8 (Farm 2), and 15.0 (Farm 3) piglets were born to the sows tracked during one week on the farms. Thus, altogether 2366 piglets were born and ear-tagged. Out of these pigs, 960 (the three largest/smallest from each litter) were included in this study for follow-up and fecal sampling from birth to slaughter. After slaughter and evaluation of all collected data, criteria for forming the three developmental groups were created and 25 pigs met these criteria. The fecal samples of these 25 pigs and their dams were chosen for analysis. This was clarified in the text in lines 160-164, in table S1 in the supporting information, and in lines 190-194.</p>
      <p>A further limiting factor for the number of samples was the sequencing process, which for reliable comparison of samples requires all samples to be analyzed at the same time. The lab could process only 96 samples per sequencing run. </p>
      <p>Line 148: How were pigs selected and identified?</p>
      <p>Response &#x2013; All dams giving birth a week before Check-up 1 were tracked and all piglets born during this week were ear-tagged at birth for individual identification (364, 1461, and 541 pigs respectively on Farms 1-3). Lines 160-164 have been revised for clarification.</p>
      <p>Line 150: What time points were evaluated?</p>
      <p>Response &#x2013; For each of the three phases (initial exposure, transitional, and stable phase) one timepoint and corresponding fecal sample was evaluated. The justification for choosing these phases is presented in the introduction and in Figure 1. For the initial exposure phase, the time point was during the tracked birth week on the farms (Check-up 1, pigs were 2-6 days of age). For the transitional phase the timepoint was around weaning (Check-up 2, pigs were 23-42 days old), and for the stable phase it was at the end of the fattening period (Check-up 5, pigs were 133-149 days old). Timepoints and fecal sampling points are shown in Figure 2. A clarification was added to the text in lines 166&#x2013;167. </p>
      <p>Line 151: Birth weight and current weight?</p>
      <p>Response &#x2013; Pigs were weighed only during birth week. Wording &#x201C;during birth week&#x201D; was added to the text in lines 168-169. Carcass weight was received from the slaughterhouse post slaughtering. </p>
      <p>Line 152: Were pigs selected for and marketed based on days on feed or body weight?</p>
      <p>Response &#x2013; Pigs were marketed based on body weight (around 120 kg live weight at slaughter). According to the selection criteria of the study, pigs were eligible for the study, if they grew either + or - 1/2x the farm average ADG. </p>
      <p>Line 154: Provide some (not all) details in the text for the reader.</p>
      <p>Response &#x2013; The text was revised, and details were added in lines 167-176.</p>
      <p>Line 161: insert "during lactation" after "information"</p>
      <p>Response &#x2013; Information was collected throughout the lives of the pigs and therefore &#x201C;during lactation&#x201D; does not fit in line 190.</p>
      <p>Line 162: delete "These criteria are summarized in"</p>
      <p>Response &#x2013; &#x201C;These criteria are summarized in&#x201D; was deleted.</p>
      <p>Line 163: Why were only these pigs selected?</p>
      <p>Response &#x2013; For a manageable number of samples, three largest and three smallest pigs from each litter were selected to follow-up on their growth until slaughter (n=960). After slaughter and evaluation of all collected data, criteria for forming the three developmental groups were created and 25 pigs met these criteria. Inclusion criteria was availability of fecal samples (piglets and their dams) and antimicrobial medication information, and growth parameters (Table 1) leaving with the 25 piglets and their dams. </p>
      <p>Line 163: Does that mean at least one pig from each litter?</p>
      <p>Response &#x2013; Yes, all pigs, except for 2, were from different litters. </p>
      <p>Line 165: When did these pigs die?</p>
      <p>Response &#x2013; They died at the ages of 2, 28, 59, and 69 days. A clarification was added in the text in lines 194-195.</p>
      <p>Line 165: Did you confirm the reason was injury?</p>
      <p>Response &#x2013; Unfortunately all farms did not collect information on all death reasons of animals even though they were expected to. Therefore, reasons of death for three of the PrematureDeath pigs are unknown, and the fourth one died due to diarrhea.</p>
      <p>Line 175: How are the sampling dates considered in the statistical analysis?</p>
      <p>Response &#x2013; The data was aggregated into the three time points that correspond to approximate sampling time as described in lines 166-181 in Materials and Methods (see also Figure 2). The dates were not considered in the analysis.</p>
      <p>Line 253: There is no indication how the potential influence of different farms was considered in the analysis. How was each farm tested as a separate block? How was parity influence considered? What are the performance metrics considered and how were they evaluated?</p>
      <p>Response &#x2013; Farm was not considered in the analysis. The aim was to isolate pig-derived Lactobacillaceae from the same slaughterhouse contract farms. The farms were chosen according to similar pig management and farm size (piglet production farms with 1000-1300 sows). Fecal samples were analyzed from 25 pigs of which 3 were from farm 1, 5 from farm 2, and 17 from farm 3. This does not invite for statistical analysis between farms. </p>
      <p>Parity influence was not taken into consideration, because five out of 24 sows were of first parity. Their offspring were in all three development groups: one in group good, 3 in group poorly, and 1 in group PrematureDeath. </p>
      <p>The 25 pigs were selected retrospectively based on ADG, antimicrobial treatments, and meat inspection results out of 960 pigs. For this reason, we could not include performance metrics in this study. Regarding the next study with a larger study group, performance metrics should be taken into consideration.</p>
      <p>Line 306: Was this pig considered in further analysis?</p>
      <p>Response &#x2013; Pig Good8 was considered in further analysis even though no culturable Lactobacillaceae were detected in the transitional phase sample. Lactobacillaceae were detected in the initial exposure phase sample as well as in the stable phase sample. </p>
      <p>Line 401: What are other probable sources?</p>
      <p>Response &#x2013; Other probable sources for Lactobacillaceae would be the environment. </p>
      <p>Line 418: Were any surfaces swabbed in this study? How were the rooms cleaned and disinfected before farrowing?</p>
      <p>Response &#x2013; No surfaces were swabbed. The rooms were cleaned with a pressure washer between batches. </p>
      <p>Line 418: Why were cross-fostered pigs chosen and not excluded? </p>
      <p>Response &#x2013; We had no possibility to influence the management on the farms. All farms were commercial farms with their own practices and management routines. Given the choice, we would have excluded cross-fostered animals. However, cross-fostering was very common on these farms (around 70% of piglets were cross-fostered, estimation of the researchers). Since the study was conducted on commercial farms, excluding cross-fostered piglets would not describe the real microbial situation in the guts of commercial pigs.</p>
      <p>Line 444: Why were medicated pigs chosen and not excluded?</p>
      <p>Response &#x2013; The majority of medicated pigs reached slaughter age. In our other manuscript, which is also under revision, we saw decreased growth in medicated pigs indicating these pigs filling the criteria of poor growth for this study. </p>
      <p>Lines 486-487: This is a major shortcoming of the manuscript. Diet composition is known to influence the microbiome. Lack of information such draws serious questions about the validity of the study results.</p>
      <p>Response &#x2013; Thank you for the relevant comment. This study was conducted to follow up on the growth rate of the pigs in reflection to their gut Lactobacillaceae. The source of the Lactobacillaceae was secondary but discussed based on the literature. It is known, that early-life microbiome, including Lactobacillaceae, received from the dam shapes the core microbiome of pigs. Feed (other than dam milk) is more of a secondary influence at the beginning. When undisturbed (e.g., no administration of antimicrobials) the diversity of the core microbiome remains throughout the animals life. If the diversity however is disturbed, it will not recover. This core microbiota is the basis of health and of interest to us in this study. </p>
      <p>A secondary microbiota develops after weaning and this microbiota is very adaptable to influences and also very recovering. Diet and the environment influence the secondary microbiota in short-term meaning; as long as microbes are provided (through feed or the environment) they can be found in the gut, but as soon as the provision ends also microbes disappear from the gut. In this study, pigs received the same diet throughout each farm and therefore the effect of the microbiome is seen in all animals. </p>
      <p>For this study we aimed to identify the core microbiome in correlation with pig growth. The text in the limitations paragraph has been revised accordingly in lines 545-550.</p>
      <p>Figures: All figures should include all the information needed to stand alone.</p>
      <p>Response &#x2013; Legends of figures have been revised to meet the standards of the journal. </p>
      <p>Reviewer #2: Author studied Fecal microbiota profiles of growing pigs and their relation to growth performance.</p>
      <p>Line 113: since there were only three farms, please note the number of sows and finisher pigs from each farm.</p>
      <p>Response &#x2013; Thank you for the comment. Numbers of sows and finisher pigs for each farm have been added in lines 116-123.</p>
      <p>Line 118 please provide the size of pen.</p>
      <p>Response &#x2013; Pen sizes were according to Finnish standards. Farrowing pens: 4,5 m2. Space allowance for pigs in the weaning unit and on the finishing farm increase from 0.4 m2 for 30 kg pigs to 0.9 m2 for 120 kg pigs. This clarification has been added to the text in lines 125 and 139-142. </p>
      <p>Line 122 &#x201C;The pens were never completely clean.&#x201D;</p>
      <p>Were pens cleaned and disinfected before introducing the next group of sows?</p>
      <p>Were sows from all 3 farms received the straw before parturition?</p>
      <p>Response &#x2013; Yes, pens were cleaned with a pressure washer between batches. This was clarified in the text in lines 130-132.</p>
      <p>On all three farms sows received some straw before parturition as nest-building material.</p>
      <p>Line 123 What was the rule used for crossfoster?</p>
      <p>Response &#x2013; Since all three farms were commercial farms, the caretakers were responsible for animal management, including cross-fostering. All farms had their own practices and management routines. Piglets were regrouped to sows based on the judgement of the caretakers within a few days of farrowing. A clarification was added to the text in line 132.</p>
      <p>Line 132 to 135: Were these practices true for all 3 farms?</p>
      <p>Response &#x2013; On all three farms pigs received chains and/or pieces of wood for enrichment. Also, sawdust was introduced in the weaning unit and sawdust/straw/peat were added by the caretakers on a regular basis in weaning units and finishing farms regardless of the farm. Lines 142-143 were revised accordingly.</p>
      <p>Line 138: Is there scientific evidence that can confirm no probiotics are being added in any stage of production from all three farms? Since diets have greatly impacted the microbiomes of pigs, please provide diet compositions.</p>
      <p>Response &#x2013; The farms are a part of slaughterhouse contract breeders with general feeding instructions. The feed formulation did not contain a</p>

      <p>Reviewer #1:&#xA0;(No Response)</p>
      <p>Reviewer #2:&#xA0;Line 147: What were the pig's selection criteria? How many piglets per dam were selected? What is the dam distribution for each farm?</p>
      <p>Response &#x2013; Parturitions were tracked on all three farms for one week. During this time on Farm 1 30 sows gave birth to 364 piglets, on Farm 2 91 sows gave birth to 1461 piglets, and on Farm 3 39 sows gave birth to 541 piglets. All piglets born during this week were ear-tagged at birth for individual identification. For this study, from each litter the three largest and three smallest pigs were regarded (n=960). From these pigs fecal samples and information was collected from birth until slaughter.</p>
      <p>The text has been revised in lines 160-164 to express this more clearly. Also, Table S1 was added to the supporting material to provide additional information on farms and sows.</p>
      <p>Q: It is surprising that the mortality of pigs from this trial, especially those with the most miniature pigs. what is the typical mortality rate in these systems? Were medication diets and zinc and copper offered in these systems?</p>
      <p>ine 163: How was the gender distribution between the three categories and the number of pigs distributed from each farm?</p>
      <p>The number of observations for the Premature death group is very low. At which stage of production were these 4 pigs dead?</p>
      <p>Response &#x2013; Thank you for bringing this up. Gender was not an inclusion criterion in this study. We did not consider gender as a criterion because throughout the study pigs have not reached puberty and therefore gender specific hormones have likely not yet influenced the microbiota. Three pigs out of 25 were female. Gender distribution has been added to Table 2, which also shows distribution of pigs from each farm.</p>
      <p>Out of the pigs in the PrematureDeath group one died during suckling, one around weaning and the remaining two before transport to finishing farm at 10 weeks of age. This has been added to the text in lines 194-195.</p>
      <p>Q: What BW average were pigs marketed? Pigs typically reach their puberty around 23 to 26 weeks of age.</p>
      <p>Line 457: Was there any difference between farms?</p>
      <p>Response &#x2013; The farms are a part of slaughterhouse contract breeders with general animal husbandry guidance. Apart from this, one farm was located in south-western Finland, whereas the other two were a little further in the north. One farm had a lower medication threshold and another farm had better equipped creep areas for the nursing piglets. Otherwise, farms were quite similar in their management, routines, and environments (farm design etc.).</p>
      <p>Q: Was there a farm effect on the abundance of Lactobacillaceae?</p>
