      </fig>
      <p>Supply chain attacks, a sophisticated form of cyber warfare, involve compromising third-party suppliers to gain unauthorized access to a target&#x2019;s systems. This method allows attackers to exploit the trust established between organizations and their suppliers. The 2020 SolarWinds attack is a stark illustration of this strategy, where Russian hackers utilized vulnerabilities in SolarWinds&#x2019; update process to infiltrate thousands of organizations&#x2019; networks.<sup><xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Exploiting vulnerabilities in Internet of Things (IoT) devices is another facet of cyber threats. The 2016 Mirai botnet attack on Dyn is a notable example where compromised IoT devices were used to launch a massive distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, which overwhelms any server or network with a flood of traffic, causing significant website outages across the eastern United States, and resulted in an estimated $110 million in damages.<sup><xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Advanced persistent threats (APTs) involve unauthorized users gaining prolonged undetected access to systems. In 2015, Chinese hackers executed a large-scale APT against the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), compromising the personal data of over 21 million individuals.<sup><xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
</sup> APTs are characterized by their stealthy nature, often driven by nation-state actors with the intention of stealing sensitive data or perpetrating other attacks. The OPM breach highlighted the significant challenges organizations face in detecting and mitigating APTs.</p>
      <p>Ransomware attacks encrypt a victim&#x2019;s data, demanding payment for the decryption key. The 2017 WannaCry attack affected over 300,000 computers globally, exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows.<sup><xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
</sup> Another notable incident was the 2021 Colonial Pipeline attack, where a ransomware attack disrupted fuel supplies across the eastern United States, emphasizing the critical role that cybersecurity plays in protecting essential infrastructure.<sup><xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p>

      <p>Adding a layer of technological sophistication to social engineering are deepfakes, hyper-realistic manipulated videos or audio recordings. These &#x201C;synthetic media&#x201D; tools pose a growing threat, enabling attackers to impersonate executives, spread misinformation, or conduct sophisticated blackmail schemes. A 2020 study by the RAND Corporation warned of deepfakes&#x2019; potential use in disrupting elections, manipulating financial markets, and eroding public trust.<sup><xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
</sup> The 2023 deepfake case involving actress Rashmika Mandanna showcases the evolving threat posed by this technology, causing distress and reputational damage.<sup><xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Account takeovers are on the rise, affecting both individuals and large organizations. In 2019, Capital One experienced a major account takeover attack where a hacker gained access to the personal data of millions of users. The consequences were severe, with the hacker able to access social security numbers, credit scores, and bank account numbers, leading to an $80 million fine for Capital One.<sup><xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Credential theft is a common tactic used by attackers to gain access to sensitive information or systems. The 2018 Marriott International data breach exposed the personal information of approximately 500 million guests, as the hacker stole login credentials from a third-party vendor. Marriott faced a $123 million fine consequently.<sup><xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Malicious insiders, individuals with authorized access to an organization&#x2019;s systems, can pose a significant threat when they misuse that access. In 2019, a former Tesla employee was charged with stealing confidential information and intellectual property from the company&#x2019;s system. The employee had access to the company&#x2019;s systems and copied more than 300,000 files to his personal account.<sup><xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
</sup> The 2023 leak of classified Pentagon documents to a video game chat group underscores the insidious nature of insider threats too.<sup><xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p>
      <p>The Stuxnet worm is a notable example of a zero-day attack, where an attacker exploits a previously unknown vulnerability in software.<sup><xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
</sup> It targeted industrial control systems, exploiting several zero-day vulnerabilities in Windows and Siemens software to modify programmable logic controllers and potentially cause physical damage. The attack is believed to have been carried out by a nation-state actor and has had significant implications for the development of cyber weapons and the use of zero-day exploits in warfare.</p>
      <p>These examples show the devastating financial and reputational consequences that cybersecurity attacks can have. Companies may face legal sanctions, loss of customers, and significant damage to their brand reputation. Additionally, society as a whole may suffer from the loss of sensitive information, disruptions to critical infrastructure, and an increased risk of identity theft and fraud. In light of these risks, organizations must take cybersecurity seriously and invest in robust security measures to safeguard their systems and data.</p>

      <p>Traditional security approaches, akin to a &#x201C;castle-and-moat,&#x201D; are becoming obsolete in today&#x2019;s interconnected world. Zero trust architecture (ZTA) offers a paradigm shift through micro-segmentation, access control, continuous authentication, and authorization. ZTA envisions dividing a network into mini fortresses, each housing specific data or applications. Implementing least-privilege access prevents unauthorized lateral movement within the network (<xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Dynamic trust verification ensures that trust is continuously verified throughout a session, adapting to the evolving risk landscape. ZTA employs a multi-factor security system on &#x201C;steroids.&#x201D; Beyond passwords, it leverages factors such as fingerprints, biometric scans, or one-time codes for user verification. Risk-based authentication considers contextual factors like user location and device type, adjusting authentication requirements based on the assessed risk.<sup><xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup></p>

      <title>Proposed Solutions for Safeguarding Digital Integrity</title>
      <p>We&#x2019;ve covered various solutions focused on preventing cybersecurity threats, acknowledging that there&#x2019;s no one-size-fits-all solution. Now, let&#x2019;s shift our focus to a different angle of the issue. How can we minimize the dissemination of leaked confidential information? What measures can be implemented to make data breaches less rewarding, discouraging potential attackers from initiating such actions? Let&#x2019;s explore solutions centered around these questions.</p>
      <sec id="sec5.1">
        <title>Concept of Deleakification</title>
        <p>Embracing the philosophy that a proactive approach is key to effective defense, I&#x2019;ve developed a concept that aligns with this principle. Before delving into the details, let&#x2019;s familiarize ourselves with some essential terms that will prove beneficial in our exploration.</p>
        <p>To begin, hex data, or hexadecimal data, is a representation of information in a base-16 numerical system. This serves as a fundamental format for encoding binary data, commonly employed in programming and computer science.</p>
        <p>Content-based fingerprinting is a technique that examines a file&#x2019;s visual or audio content to craft a unique fingerprint&#x2014;a kind of digital &#x201C;hash&#x201D; that captures the media&#x2019;s essence without requiring playback. Algorithms extract features like colors, textures, shapes, or audio frequencies to compose this fingerprint. Importantly, this method remains effective in identifying original content, even if the file format undergoes changes or compression.<sup><xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Perceptual hashing shifts the focus to how humans perceive content. Despite noise, compression artifacts, or editing, perceptual hashing remains robust in uniquely identifying media.<sup><xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup></p>
        <p>Moving on, a worm is a type of malicious software capable of independent replication and spreading across networks and systems. Worms exploit vulnerabilities, presenting a significant threat to the security of interconnected environments.</p>
        <p>Similarly, Trojan malware disguises itself as legitimate software, deceiving users into installing it. Once infiltrated, it enables unauthorized access and can compromise sensitive information or facilitate other malicious activities.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, a logic bomb is a piece of code intentionally inserted into a software system to execute harmful actions when specific conditions are met. These conditions can be triggered by various events, potentially causing disruption or damage to the system.</p>
        <p>In the realm of recent vulnerabilities, it&#x2019;s crucial to highlight the critical WebP image vulnerability (CVE-2023-4863).<sup><xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> This flaw allowed attackers to execute malicious code through crafted .webp files, affecting numerous applications due to the widespread use of the libwebp library for handling such images. Immediate software updates are essential to address this vulnerability and ensure protection.</p>
        <p>Shifting our focus to built-in safeguards, operating system (OS) inbuilt virus scanners and search indexers are integral tools designed to detect and neutralize viruses and malware. These utilities actively monitor and identify potential threats, contributing significantly to the overall security of the system.</p>
        <p>Additionally, a content delivery network (CDN) serves as a distributed system of servers collaborating to deliver web content efficiently based on users&#x2019; geographical locations. Beyond enhancing website performance, CDNs provide an added layer of security against specific cyber threats.</p>
        <p>Understanding these terminologies is essential for grasping the nuances of the concept that centers around a proactive defense strategy. Now, let&#x2019;s delve into the specifics of how each of these elements contributes to building my robust cybersecurity approach.</p>
        <p>The process involves taking the desired media or text files for &#x201C;unleaking.&#x201D; These files are then processed through software like hex dump or Vim to obtain hex data for text files and unique identifier information for media files, leveraging content-based fingerprinting and perceptual hashing methodologies. Subsequently, a worm code is developed, designed to spread through the internet and connect to CDNs to download trojans (<xref rid="F0006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>).</p>
        <fig position="float" id="F0006">
          <label>Fig. 6</label>
          <caption>
            <p>Flowchart diagram explanation of the working mechanism.</p>
          </caption>
          <graphic xlink:href="BHTY-7-302-g006" position="float"/>
        </fig>
        <p>Once the worm is active on a device, it retrieves the trojan package, and the trojan, in turn, downloads the metadata (hex data or unique identifiers) previously generated and dispersed across various public or private CDNs. The next step involves the trojan pairing with the system&#x2019;s inbuilt virus scanners or search indexes, initiating a scan to find matches for the stored metadata.</p>
        <p>In cases where the system lacks a scanner for root/admin access, the worm can download its own from preloaded ones in the CDN. Utilizing a Trojan horse strategy, the worm may deceive users into granting admin privileges by presenting itself as a system file. Returning to the scanning process, if a match is detected, the worm acts as a logic bomb, corrupting files by replacing the original data with garbage data. This method aims to remove the leaked information without causing any additional destructive actions.</p>
        <p>In situations where CDN access is unavailable, the worm script can be attached to a file and sent to unsuspecting users, reminiscent of techniques like Word macros or exploiting vulnerabilities like .webp. Once executed, the worm undertakes its tasks. Additionally, the worm is programmed to detect the presence of any existing trojans to prevent system overload and potential user detection. This comprehensive approach ensures a strategic and nuanced method for addressing leaked information.</p>

Before delving into the operational details of the model, it&#x2019;s crucial to familiarize ourselves with the associated terminology.</p>
        <p>The DIDs are a foundational element of Web 3.0, playing a vital role in providing users with a decentralized mechanism to create and manage unique identities online. Users, through DIDs, gain the autonomy to establish and control their digital personas independently, thereby enhancing privacy. An example illustrating this is the capability of DIDs to enable individuals to create and manage online identities without relying on a central authority, aligning with the overarching theme of enhancing user privacy in the digital realm.<sup><xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup></p>
        <p>VCs constitute a pivotal aspect of Web 3.0, facilitating the issuance and presentation of tamper-proof, digitally verifiable credentials. In practical terms, individuals can share digitally signed credentials, such as diplomas, without divulging unnecessary personal information. This exemplifies the role of VCs in bolstering privacy and security, providing a tangible illustration of how they empower users in the digital landscape.<sup><xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup></p>
        <p>Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) stand out as a crucial cryptographic technique within the Web 3.0 paradigm, enabling parties to prove the authenticity of information without disclosing the actual data. The ZKPs contribute significantly to privacy by verifying information without revealing underlying details. An example that illustrates this concept is when ZKPs allow someone to prove knowledge of a secret without disclosing the secret itself, thereby ensuring privacy in digital transactions.<sup><xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup></p>
        <p>Federated learning (FL) transforms the landscape of ML in Web 3.0 by facilitating collaborative model training across decentralized devices. An example that showcases FL&#x2019;s privacy-conscious approach is its ability to enable mobile devices to collaboratively train a predictive model without exchanging raw data. This preserves user privacy while harnessing aggregated knowledge for the benefit of the entire system.<sup><xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup></p>
        <p>SMPC plays a critical role in Web 3.0, enabling secure computation across multiple parties without exposing individual inputs. An illustrative example is when SMPC allows multiple parties to jointly compute a result without revealing their individual inputs. This functionality proves valuable for confidential data analysis, highlighting its significance in safeguarding privacy.<sup><xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup></p>
        <p>Personal data stores (PDS) empower individuals to manage their personal data securely within a private repository. For instance, PDS enables users to control access to their stored information, reinforcing user control over their digital identity and enhancing privacy in the management of personal data.<sup><xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup></p>
        <p>Blockchain-based data storage (BBDS) is a revolutionary concept in Web 3.0, decentralizing information storage across a network of nodes. This transparent and tamper-resistant approach ensures data integrity and minimizes the risk of unauthorized alterations. An example illustrating this concept is how blockchain stores data, making it resistant to tampering and ensuring transparent, secure, and privacy-enhanced data storage.<sup><xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup></p>
        <p>Trusted execution environments (TEEs) contribute significantly to Web 3.0 by providing secure spaces on devices for processing sensitive information. TEEs in action are their ability to safeguard encryption keys and protect user privacy by ensuring certain processes occur in a trusted and protected space on a device.<sup><xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup></p>
        <p>Currently, the terminologies may not be entirely clear (<xref rid="F0007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). Let&#x2019;s gain a comprehensive understanding of all these concepts by utilizing the model and exploring an example that demonstrates the functionality of each model.</p>
        <fig position="float" id="F0007">
          <label>Fig. 7</label>
          <caption>

          <graphic xlink:href="BHTY-7-302-g007" position="float"/>
        </fig>
        <p>In this futuristic voting scenario powered by Web 3.0 technologies, individuals experience a transformative and privacy-focused electoral process. Each voter is equipped with a DID stored on their mobile device, granting them ownership and control of their digital identity independent of a central authority. Instead of traditional physical identification, voters issue secure VCs through their DIDs directly from government databases, proving eligibility without compromising personal details and thereby enhancing privacy.</p>
        <p>To further ensure privacy, the election authority employs ZKPs to verify voter eligibility without accessing individual records and confirm eligibility without exposing specific details. Collaborative predictive modeling is achieved through FL, where ML models are trained on encrypted voter data stored securely on individual devices. This not only enhances predictive accuracy but also maintains privacy throughout the process.</p>
        <p>The integrity of the election results is safeguarded by leveraging SMPC during result calculations. Election officials and independent auditors collaboratively analyze voting data without directly sharing sensitive information, thereby preserving the confidentiality of individual votes. Voters retain control over their voting history and preferences through PDS, accessible by the election commission only with explicit voter consent through DIDs and VCs, minimizing data exposure and empowering users to manage their information securely (<xref rid="F0008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>).</p>
        <fig position="float" id="F0008">
          <label>Fig. 8</label>

            <p>Voting scenario example. FL: federated learning; TEE: trusted execution environments; ZKP: zero-knowledge proofs.</p>
          </caption>
          <graphic xlink:href="BHTY-7-302-g008" position="float"/>
        </fig>
        <p>Transparent and tamper-resistant storage is achieved through BBDS, where the election results and voting records are securely stored on a permissioned blockchain. This ensures the integrity of the electoral process while restricting access to authorized entities. Additionally, TEEs contribute an extra layer of security by isolating sensitive calculations, such as fraud detection and result verification, within trusted enclaves on voters&#x2019; devices.</p>
        <p>This comprehensive example demonstrates how Web 3.0 principles revolutionize real-world applications. It offers a secure, transparent, and privacy-centric voting experience in which individuals maintain control over their identities and personal data throughout the entire electoral process.</p>
