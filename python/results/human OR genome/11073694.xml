      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Osteomyelitis of the jaw is a severe inflammatory disorder that affects the bones, and it is challenging to treat owing to the high recurrence rate of the chronic forms. However, the lack of international consensus on the definitions of these forms hampers their diagnosis. Similarly, differences in the treatment strategies reflect an inadequate understanding of the predisposing factors and processes leading to jaw osteomyelitis.</p>
      <p>Osteomyelitis of the jaw is not a unique condition, and two main types have been described in the literature. The first type is characterized by an apparent odontogenic infectious etiology and is typically defined as secondary chronic osteomyelitis [<xref rid="pone.0302569.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Herein, we refer to it as chronic bacterial osteomyelitis, where identifiable infectious pathogens are present, leading to suppurative variants characterized by the presence of pus, abscesses, fistulas, and/or sequestrations [<xref rid="pone.0302569.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The second type of osteomyelitis is the non-suppurative chronic variant, which is defined as a chronic inflammatory disorder of unknown etiology [<xref rid="pone.0302569.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Herein, we refer to this condition as chronic nonbacterial osteomyelitis (CNO), which encompasses primary chronic osteomyelitis, diffuse sclerosing osteomyelitis, juvenile mandibular chronic osteomyelitis, and chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis. Although CNO does not exclude the presence of pathogens, it is considered a chronic variant without suppurative characteristics [<xref rid="pone.0302569.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>
      <p>The influence of genetic and immunological backgrounds on CNO is not completely understood. A recent study defined the alleles of all 35 human leukocyte antigen (HLA) loci and haplotype structures of the killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) region and identified a specific amino acid substitution in HLA-C in combination with the telomeric KIR genotype, which had a significantly higher frequency in the CNO population compared to the control population [<xref rid="pone.0302569.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Another recent study investigated CNO based on whole blood RNA sequencing (&gt;6 Gb per sample) of 11 patients and 9 healthy controls in Japan and employed a recently developed method suitable for small datasets. This study revealed subnetworks of genes underlying patient characteristics and identified the gene encoding glycophorin C with the highest discrimination ability [<xref rid="pone.0302569.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p>
      <p>Although CNO is an inflammatory disorder, the mechanisms triggering this inflammatory process are poorly understood. Several authors have reported negative bacterial culturing from biopsies, indicating a nonbacterial origin [<xref rid="pone.0302569.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0302569.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The inflammatory nonsuppurative process supports the suspicion of an autoimmune etiology. Recent studies have highlighted the role of the microbiome in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases [<xref rid="pone.0302569.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0302569.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These studies suggest that the microbiome not only directly influences the pathogenesis of osteomyelitis but also indirectly affects it through biochemical signals produced by the microbiota of non-osseous tissues that trigger cells and microbes within the osteomyelitis tissue. A recent pilot study focusing on chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis, a severe systemic type of CNO involving multifocal autoinflammatory bone lesions, applied 16S rRNA gene sequencing to oral swab samples from patients. This study reported a shift in the composition of the oral microbiome among patients treated with different medications, although specific taxa significantly associated with the disease were not identified or discussed [<xref rid="pone.0302569.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p>
      <p>Several studies have previously explored the associations between chronic bacterial osteomyelitis and microbial infection, as summarized in a recent review [<xref rid="pone.0302569.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. For example, an <italic toggle="yes">Escherichia coli</italic> strain exhibiting multiple antibiotic resistance was cultured from bilateral maxillary osteomyelitis of a patient with diabetes [<xref rid="pone.0302569.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. <italic toggle="yes">Actinomyces</italic> identified from patients with maxillary osteomyelitis were suggested to be derived from pulpal or periodontal infections [<xref rid="pone.0302569.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Another study that sampled infected bone detected three predominant commensal anaerobic strains (<italic toggle="yes">Parvimonas micra</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus</italic> spp., and <italic toggle="yes">Fusobacterium nucleatum</italic>) through PCR analysis [<xref rid="pone.0302569.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Additionally, 16S rRNA gene sequencing of bone samples of different types of osteomyelitis, including chronic bacterial osteomyelitis (suppurative osteomyelitis) and CNO, reported that the core microbiome is predominantly composed of anaerobic microbes, such as <italic toggle="yes">Fusobacterium nucleatum</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Tannerella</italic> sp., and <italic toggle="yes">Porphyromonas</italic> sp. [<xref rid="pone.0302569.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p>
      <p>However, approaches based on bacterial culture and PCR have limitations and may miss unculturable microbes associated with the disease. Although 16S rRNA gene sequencing is widely used, it also has limitations, such as the introduction of biases from several sources, including PCR amplification, primer design, and sequencing artifacts [<xref rid="pone.0302569.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Furthermore, the previous study that employed 16S rRNA gene sequencing on bone samples [<xref rid="pone.0302569.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] did not distinguish between chronic bacterial osteomyelitis and CNO and instead focused on reclassification into three clinical stages. A recent review citing a previous 16S rRNA study concluded that no conclusive microbiome analyses of chronic bacterial osteomyelitis of the jaw have been reported [<xref rid="pone.0302569.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Therefore, the contribution of the increased prevalence of specific microbial taxa in the oral microbiota to osteomyelitis remains unknown. Additionally, 16S rRNA gene sequencing does not provide information on the presence, abundance, or function of specific genes in the microbiome.</p>
      <p>To address these current challenges, we conducted shotgun metagenome sequencing (&#x2265;10 Gb per sample) of bulk DNA extracted from the saliva of patients with chronic bacterial osteomyelitis and CNO. We then compared the metagenome data with those of healthy controls in Japan from our previous study [<xref rid="pone.0302569.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], which were generated using the same sample collection and DNA extraction protocols as the present study and are publicly available. Through comparative quantitative analyses of the taxonomic compositions of these deep metagenomes in terms of both taxonomic and sequence abundances, we found a statistically significant increase in the abundance of <italic toggle="yes">Mogibacterium</italic> in chronic bacterial osteomyelitis, which suggests its potential as a marker to distinguish between patients with CNO and chronic bacterial osteomyelitis.</p>

        <title>Diagnostic criteria</title>
        <p>Although various diagnostic techniques are employed to assess osteomyelitis, the consensus among authors is that the final diagnosis should be based on multiple criteria, including clinical presentation, patient history, and imaging techniques [<xref rid="pone.0302569.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In cases of chronic osteomyelitis, the presence of infectious pathogens can be observed in different stages, namely in pus, abscess/fistula, and sequestration. In most of these cases, there is an apparent odontogenic or infectious etiology, typically resulting from trauma that introduces pathogens into the tissues. In this study, this condition was defined as chronic bacterial osteomyelitis.</p>
        <p>The diagnostic criteria for CNO were consistent with those used in our previous study [<xref rid="pone.0302569.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]: 1) recurrent pain and swelling; 2) radiographic appearance of a mixed pattern of sclerosis and osteolysis, and uptake of scintigraphic agents (such as technetium 99 m) in the jawbone; 3) limited or no response to antibiotic treatment; and 4) increased bone resorption and deposition, along with varying degrees of bone sclerosis and medullary fibrosis, without suspicion of malignancy.</p>

Based on previous reports that microbial profiles within subjects were stable throughout a 24-h period [<xref rid="pone.0302569.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and that similar profiles could be obtained from unstimulated and stimulated saliva [<xref rid="pone.0302569.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], 1 mL of unstimulated saliva was collected and stored using a specialized kit for microbial and viral DNA/RNA (OMNIgene ORAL OM-501), following established protocols [<xref rid="pone.0302569.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0302569.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].

        <p>The EDGE pipeline version 1.5 [<xref rid="pone.0302569.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] was used for preprocessing (trimming or filtering out reads and removing reads mapped to the human genome) of the HiSeq data. The initial quality control step discarded 0.06&#x2013;1.54% of reads and trimmed 0.06&#x2013;1.54% of bases. Subsequently, 0.09&#x2013;31.1% of the filtered reads that mapped to the human genome were removed. Subsequently, the lowest number of remaining read pairs among the samples was 27,478,389 (8.2 Gb). To account for differences in sequence coverage, we randomly selected the same number of read pairs from each sample [<xref rid="pone.0302569.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] for subsequent analyses using BBmap, which is included in the BBTools software package [<xref rid="pone.0302569.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p>
        <p>Taxonomic profiling was conducted using MetaPhlAn3 [<xref rid="pone.0302569.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and Kraken2 [<xref rid="pone.0302569.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] followed by Bracken [<xref rid="pone.0302569.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] to estimate the &#x201C;taxonomic abundance&#x201D; (calculated as the number of genomes (single-copy marker genes) of a given taxon relative to the total number of genomes detected) and &#x201C;sequence abundance&#x201D; (calculated as the proportion of sequence reads assigned to a given taxon out of the total number of sequence reads) [<xref rid="pone.0302569.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. As MetaPhlAn3 treats paired reads independently, we concatenated the read pairs into a single input file in advance using BBmap while subsampling the reads [<xref rid="pone.0302569.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Sequence abundance refers to the fraction of sequence reads assigned to each taxon in the reference genome database and depends on the genome size of the taxon, potentially resulting in under-or overestimation. In contrast, taxonomic abundance is the ratio of the sequence coverage of single-copy marker genes of each taxon to that of all taxa. This approach avoids underestimation or overestimation caused by variations in genome size [<xref rid="pone.0302569.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In this study, we primarily used the taxonomic abundance as our main metric. Functional profiling was conducted using HUMAnN 3.0 [<xref rid="pone.0302569.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p>

Meanwhile, the average taxonomic abundances of <italic toggle="yes">Mogibacterium</italic> were 0.9%, 5.7%, and 0.4% in the CNO, chronic bacterial osteomyelitis, and healthy control groups, respectively.

The Spearman&#x2019;s correlation coefficient for this comparison was 0.5. Several genera exhibited notable differences between taxonomic and sequence abundance estimates. <italic toggle="yes">Streptococcus</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Prevotella</italic> displayed an overestimation of sequence abundance (&gt;10%) compared with taxonomic abundance, whereas <italic toggle="yes">Actinomyces</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Lachnospiraceae</italic> exhibited an underestimation of sequence abundance (&gt;10%).

        <p>However, <italic toggle="yes">Rothia</italic> demonstrated a contrasting pattern, with one sample showing a &gt;10% overestimation of sequence abundance and two samples showing a &gt;10% underestimation. The disparity in direction across these three samples may be attributed to the considerable variation in the proportion of reads that were not mapped to any taxon during the calculation of sequence abundance.

These findings suggest that <italic toggle="yes">Mogibacterium</italic> is not a core genus in the saliva microbiome but appears to increase in abundance in chronic bacterial osteomyelitis. In addition, because the previous meta-analysis was confined to salivary shotgun metagenome data obtained in California, the substantial difference in taxon composition may reflect differences in dietary culture between North America and Japan because diet plays a substantial role in the formation of the general oral microbiome.</p>

The core genome contained 10853 base pairs (0.6% of the reference complete genome) and 2712 single nucleotide polymorphisms, suggesting incomplete assembly of the metagenome samples and large genetic diversity in the genus.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p><italic toggle="yes">Mogibacterium</italic> is a genus of anaerobic, gram-positive, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped bacteria originally isolated from the periodontal pockets of adult human patients with periodontal disease and infected root canals [<xref rid="pone.0302569.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The pro-inflammatory effects of <italic toggle="yes">Mogibacterium</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Porphyromonas</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Treponema</italic> has been suggested to be responsible for the progression of medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw, which has similar symptoms to osteomyelitis [<xref rid="pone.0302569.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. <italic toggle="yes">Mogibacterium</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Solobacterium</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Slackia</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Moryella</italic> are increased in the salivary microbiome of patients with immunoglobulin G4-related diseases compared with that of patients with primary Sj&#xF6;gren&#x2019;s syndrome [<xref rid="pone.0302569.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Therefore, <italic toggle="yes">Mogibacterium</italic> is likely associated with multiple diseases, including chronic bacterial osteomyelitis, as shown in this study. We found an increased abundance of <italic toggle="yes">Mogibacterium</italic> in chronic bacterial osteomyelitis, suggesting its association with the disease. Further investigation of its molecular mechanisms requires experimental analysis using isolated strains, which is challenging owing to the low abundance and anaerobic culturing requirements of <italic toggle="yes">Mogibacterium</italic>.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, despite being considered distinct diseases, CNO and chronic bacterial osteomyelitis exhibited a high overall taxonomic profile correlation (Spearman&#x2019;s correlation coefficient: 0.85). The only exception was for <italic toggle="yes">Mogibacterium</italic>, which showed a significant increase in the chronic bacterial osteomyelitis group, making it a potential marker for distinguishing between the two conditions. This might be of particular importance at an early stage, in which the differences between both diseases are unclear. Alternatively, differences in host immunity and/or genetics may play a more significant role in differentiating CNO and chronic bacterial osteomyelitis.</p>
      <p>However, the sample size of the present study was small (N = 5 in the chronic bacterial osteomyelitis group). Although all five patients with chronic bacterial osteomyelitis showed a greater taxonomic abundance of <italic toggle="yes">Mogibacterium</italic> than the five healthy controls, the abundance values for two of these patients appeared to be outliers that were distinct relative to those of CNO patients (<xref rid="pone.0302569.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1b</xref>). Further studies should be performed with additional data on chronic bacterial osteomyelitis patients to explore the external validity of the study and determine the frequency of such outliers, which may represent a potential characteristic of chronic bacterial osteomyelitis.</p>
      <p>We compared the taxonomic and sequence abundances of the 74 bacterial genera detected using salivary shotgun metagenome data. Viruses were not analyzed because the summation of their sequence abundance per sample was consistently less than 0.1% and MetaPhlAn3 was not designed to estimate the taxonomic abundance of viruses. The challenges associated with sequence abundance, including its dependence on genome size and the potential for under- or overestimation compared to taxonomic abundance, have recently been highlighted using simulated data [<xref rid="pone.0302569.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. We observed that <italic toggle="yes">Streptococcus</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Prevotella</italic> were overestimated in multiple samples and <italic toggle="yes">Actinomyces</italic> was consistently underestimated. However, the genome size of <italic toggle="yes">Actinomyces</italic> is approximately 3 Mb, which is larger than that of <italic toggle="yes">Streptococcus</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Prevotella</italic> (approximately 2 Mb). This finding is inconsistent with that of a recent study [<xref rid="pone.0302569.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], which suggested the possibility of overestimating sequence abundance in taxa with larger genome sizes. Moreover, this discrepancy may be attributed to the sequence abundance being estimated at the genus level in the current study, rather than the species level as performed in the recent study. Alternatively, this discrepancy may also be attributed to other unknown factors.</p>
      <p>A comparison with a previously reported core salivary microbiome revealed discrepancies, with nearly half of the previously reported genera not observed in our study and more than half of our detected genera not included in the previous study. This highlights the greater taxonomic diversity of the human oral microbiota than previously recognized, which is based on the influence of factors such as geography, diet, host health conditions, and sequencing protocol.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>This study is the first to demonstrate a significant increase in the abundance of <italic toggle="yes">Mogibacterium</italic> in chronic bacterial osteomyelitis. Additionally, we present a systematic comparison of the taxonomic and sequence abundances of all genera detected using deep salivary shotgun metagenome data. Because the sample size used in this exploratory and descriptive study was small, these preliminary data require further verification. However, the findings of our study lay the groundwork for further investigations of the mechanisms underlying chronic bacterial osteomyelitis compared with those underlying CNO. Overall, this research contributes to a better understanding of the role of <italic toggle="yes">Mogibacterium</italic> in chronic bacterial osteomyelitis and provides a foundation for future studies aimed at unraveling the complexities of oral microbiota-related diseases.</p>

      <p>Reviewer #1:&#xA0;The authors have presented a well-written, clear and concise paper to show the results of a study to investigate the salivary bacterial composition of people with osteomyelitis. The abstract and introduction are logical and complete, the materials and methods present the sampling and data creation well, and the results and discussion bring the work together and explain the conclusions well. My only comment is the number of samples that were taken, being n=10 and n=5 respectively for different types of osteomyelitis. It is a small sample set, but I do understand that this is an exploratory and descriptive study. Are there other datasets to compare these results with? I was pleased to see the depth of sequencing- in my experience the hardest consequence of salivary studies is to gain enough bacterial reads above the human reads. A final question is what the overall bacterial abundance is in real terms and how this relates to the healthy controls. Could increase in relative abundance of Mogibacterium be a consequence of a proliferating bacterial counts in the saliva? In short, a complete descriptive paper that will likely stimulate understandings of the progression of disease.</p>
      <p>Reviewer #2:&#xA0;Review of the article titled Shotgun metagenomics comparing taxonomic and sequence abundances identifies Mogibacterium associated with chronic bacterial osteomyelitis in the saliva microbiome</p>
      <p>Summary</p>
      <p>The authors of this article clearly display the signs of expertise and competence in their field. The article is well written and the main points are clearly discussed with understandable and elaborate language. Based on their published literature they are well entrenched in this research field, which is clearly shown from their confidence in handling their data and discussing the results. I believe that the findings of this article are appropriate for publication and they will be a valuable addition in the oral microbiome research. I would like them however to address some of my concerns first, mainly about the statistical analysis that they employed.</p>
      <p>Major revisions</p>
      <p>My biggest problem with the article is the data analysis in the Taxonomic profiling identifies microbes associated with chronic bacterial osteomyelitis section. Seemingly the &#x201C;taxonomic abundance&#x201D; data that you publish in this article (Table S2) is not exactly the same as the data that were used in your statistical analyses that you discuss. I take this from your statement in Line 228-229 in parenthesis and from the fact that I tried to replicate your analyses using Table S2 and I obtained substantially different results.</p>
      <p>I performed pairwise Wilcoxon tests between the patient groups across all taxa which yielded more than 4 significant differences with the given 0.05 significance threshold or none with a Bonferroni corrected threshold. I also tried to replicate your boxplots from Figure 1 but I found interesting differences (the position of the median line, position of your data points between the 25th and 75th percentiles), which &#x2013; for me &#x2013; suggest that there was an underlying distribution (differing from the data published in Table S2) that was used to create these boxplots.</p>
      <p>The reason for these discrepancies are not clear to me. If there is a difference between the employed data in the analyses and the published data in Table S2 then this difference should be strongly emphasized in the text. I would also like you to include a more detailed description of the data handling steps mentioned in Line 229 (&#x201C;using a model with default normalization and transformation implemented in MaAsLin2&#x201D;) in the Methods section, as this would explain why you would get different results from the raw sequence data.</p>
      <p>If, however, I should be able to replicate your results from the available data table (Table S2) alone, then please explain to me why I obtained different results from the ones you discussed in this section. For clarity I include my R script (verification.R) for you to check the validity of my claims.</p>
      <p>I had another problem specifically with the results concerning the Mogibacterium comparison. In my R script I also try to show you that assuming a simplistic normal distribution, 2 of your samples seems highly likely to be outliers. I don&#x2019;t want to assume that this type of data is necessarily normally distributed, but this should still indicate that you should be careful interpreting these results. I see that you touch on this topic in Line 407-408, but I would like you to also include a short disclaimer in this section as well, that you are indeed aware of the low sample size of the chronic bacterial osteomyelitis group and the possibility of some samples to be outliers.</p>
      <p>Minor revisions</p>
      <p>Title &#x2013; I would suggest a modified title &#x201C;Shotgun metagenomic analysis of saliva microbiome suggests Mogibacterium as a factor associated with chronic bacterial osteomyelitis&#x201D; or something along this line. As I don&#x2019;t think your discussion of taxonomic and sequence abundance comparison is that central to this articles message. I also suggested to change the &#x201C;identify&#x201D; part as you yourself describe these results as preliminary in the Conclusion section (Line 407-408).</p>
      <p>Line 39 &#x201C;previous study&#x201D; &#x2013; Please include a reference here.</p>
      <p>Line 168-170 &#x2013; &#x201C;we randomly selected the same number of read pairs [..] using BBmap.&#x201D; &#x2013; If this is the standard method when account for differences in sequence coverage than please include a reference here where they discuss the reason behind this method. If this is a new approach than please include a description here about the validity of this method. Also I think a reference is missing here for BBmap.</p>
      <p>Line 176-177 Which program was used for the concatenation?</p>
      <p>Line 186-187 &#x201C;Contig Annotation Tool (CAT) [30]&#x201D; &#x2013; I think a reference is missing from here, because the Nakazawa et al. 2002 article is referenced here which clearly belong to Line 196 where it is given appropriately. Please insert the proper reference (this would be von Meijenfeldt et al. 2019, <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-019-1817-x" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-019-1817-x</ext-link> ?) and number the rest of the references accordingly.</p>
      <p>Line 194-195 Mogibacterium is not mentioned prior to this statement, maybe a short introduction should be included to justify why this specific taxon was selected for the phylogenetic analysis.</p>
      <p>Line 202-203 Where can I find this heatmap, please reference this statement. If the picture/table is not included in the article, why do you mention it?</p>
      <p>Line 209-210 I think it would be appropriate to reference both JMP Pro and R software as well in the Reference list to clarify the availability of these softwares.</p>

      <p>Line 284-285 &#x201C;The blue line indicates the significant enrichment [&#x2026;]&#x201D; &#x2013; I cannot see a blue line on Figure 2. Please clarify the meaning of the sentence.</p>

      <p>TableS2 The heading of the first column describes sampleIDs, the table however seemingly contains genus names. If it was the intended nomenclature, please clarify why you chose &#x201C;sampleID&#x201D;, otherwise correct the header.</p>

      <p>Line 81 &#x201C;chronic specific inflammation&#x201D; &#x2013; I don&#x2019;t think chronic specific is an appropriate term in English. Maybe &#x201C;CNO is characterized by markers specific to chronic inflammation,&#x201D; or something along this line.</p>

      <p>Questions</p>
      <p>Line 327-328 &#x2013; I am not sure about the origin of the data used in the Oliveira et al. 2021 article, but I would presume it analysed the salival microbiomes of mainly North-American and Western European individuals. Can the difference in the taxon composition of your data also be the result of the different dietary culture of Japan and/or East Asia? I would assume that diet plays a substantial role in the formation of the general oral microbiome. I see that you elaborate on this a bit in Line 400-401, but I think a short paragraph could be also included about this after Line 328. Actually, your finding of these completely different genera compared to the previously reported &#x201C;core salival microbiome&#x201D; is much more interesting than your discussion of the Mogibacterium related results. Maybe you could elaborate on these findings in a subsequent article.</p>

      <p>Reviewer #2:&#xA0;Answer to revisions</p>
      <p>Summary</p>
      <p>Thank you for considering my review suggestion. I think the presentation of your data improved significantly and the inclusion of the requested paragraph clarified the background workings of your analysis framework. The language and overall structure of your article is still very clear and straightforward.</p>
      <p>In the next section, I would like to answer the answers to my reviews. Then I listed some suggestions concerning the Supplementary Tables. I wouldn&#x2019;t like an answer for these I just included them as to make sure to really bring out the maximum from your excellent article.</p>
      <p>Answers</p>
      <p>"The comparison also shows that the data points are the same between the 25th and 75th percentiles (shown as black dots in the middle boxes). Although the 75th percentile is indeed different (11.4 in Fig 1b and 8.5 in the figure created by reviewer&#x2019;s R script), we confirmed that it is due to a difference in the quantile algorithm between JMP and R: the 75th percentile in Fig 1b (11.4) calculated by JMP is obtained using the 6th type quantile algorithm implemented in R, whereas that in the figure by the reviewer&#x2019;s R script (8.5) is obtained using the 7th type quantile algorithm, which is the default in R."</p>
      <p>Thank you for this thorough explanation I didn&#x2019;t even know that quartile calculation was this complicated in R. I accept your answer.</p>
      <p>"According to your suggestion, we have added the following to the Methods: &#x201C;According to previous studies [38, 39], we specified the total sum scaling (TSS) normalization (to ensure that the profile values ranged from 0 to 1) and arcsine square-root transformation (AST) (to stabilize the variance and improve parametric estimation models in the presence of violated data assumptions, such as normality and homoscedasticity) [37].&#x201D; (Lines 216&#x2013;219) We have also confirmed that the arcsine square-root transformation (AST) is conducted using the following R code "sign(x) * asin(sqrt(abs(x)))", and the taxonomic abundance of Mogibacterium (normalized to be from 0 to 1) before and after the transformation is distributed as shown below (left and right, respectively). The transformation seems to make the distribution less skewed."</p>
      <p>Thank your for including this section in Methods. Your explanation clarifies the exact method that you were using, and thus I accept your answer. This helps to facilitate reproducibility furthermore provides opportunities for you to show your seemingly considerable experience working with this kind of data, which &#x2013; I think &#x2013; overall strengthens the viewers assessment of your ability to produce trustful results.</p>
      <p>"We appreciate your comment and agree with it. The illustration of the distribution above shows that the two samples at the right seem to be outliers, even after the arcsine square-root transformation (AST). Therefore, we added the following to the Discussion: &#x201C;However, the sample size of the present study was small (N=5 in the chronic bacterial osteomyelitis group). Although all five patients with chronic bacterial osteomyelitis showed a greater taxonomic abundance of Mogibacterium than the five healthy controls, the abundance values for two of these patients appeared to be outliers that were only distinct relative to those of CNO patients (Fig 1b). Further studies should be performed with additional data on chronic bacterial osteomyelitis patients to explore the external validity of the study and determine the frequency of such outliers, which may represent a potential characteristic of chronic bacterial osteomyelitis. (Lines 390&#x2013;397)"</p>
      <p>Thank you again, this section further strengthens the sincerity and transparency of your previous statements.</p>
      <p>All together I think this article is appropriate for publication in this state.</p>
      <p>Suggestions</p>
      <p>The first row in Table_S1 contains 3 white spaces before the beginning of the sentence.</p>
      <p>The name of the 5th control individual is CN001_ with an ending underscore is this a typo?</p>
      <p>The genus header in Table_S2 is still sampleID in the uploaded file but I presume you just didn&#x2019;t upload the revised version along the Response to reviewers file.</p>
      <p>I am sure the publisher has regulations in this regard, however I saw some really bad examples in even highly regarded publishers like Nature, that the name of the supplementary files were jumbled completely. Please name your files in a straightforward manner like Table_S1 or something like that because this really helps later reading and organisation for your readership.</p>
