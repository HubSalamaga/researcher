      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) can replicate and spread throughout the body, causing organ damage, inflammation, immunosuppression, persistent infection and secondary infections. Viral infection constitutes a serious threat to the health of swine and can result in huge economic losses to the industry. PRRSV is mainly prevented by vaccine at present. However, facing up immunosuppression caused by PRRSV infection, virus evolution and multiple recombination between wild-type and modified live virus (MLV), it can not be effectively prevented.</p>
      <p>Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) offers a huge pharmacopoeia of compounds and formulations rich in active ingredients and pharmacological effects, with little toxicity to animals. Fu Zheng Jie Du San (FZJDS) is a classic TCM herbal formula, which is composed of <italic toggle="yes">Hedysarum multijugum</italic> Maxim, <italic toggle="yes">Isatidis radix</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Epimedii herb</italic>a. FZJDS has been recognized as having immunomodulatory activity, and is able to restore immune cell function and induce the body to produce interferons with potent therapeutic antiviral activity against PCV2 and other viral diseases. The ingredients in FZJDS have been widely used in antiviral formulations with astragalus polysaccharide (APS) and significantly decreased PCV2 DNA replication, the level of <italic toggle="yes">MDA</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">ROS</italic>, and the activation of <italic toggle="yes">NF-&#x138;B</italic> in porcine kidney-15 cells. APS significantly increased <italic toggle="yes">GSH</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">SOD</italic> which inhibited PCV2 infection [<xref rid="pone.0283728.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Previous studies reported that APS inhibited the proliferation of astrocytes infected by the herpes simplex virus [<xref rid="pone.0283728.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The active compound of <italic toggle="yes">radix isatidis</italic> (BanLanGen), 3-(furan-2-yl)-7-hydroxyisoquinolin-1(2H)-one, has shown potent anti-HSV-1 activity with an IC50 value of 15.3 &#x3BC;g/mL [<xref rid="pone.0283728.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. <italic toggle="yes">Radix isatidis</italic> polysaccharides (RIPs) can promote the proliferation of NK cells and the expression of <italic toggle="yes">IFN-&#x3B3;</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">TNF-&#x3B1;</italic>, to regulate the immune system by activating dendritic cells, macrophages and lymphocytes [<xref rid="pone.0283728.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>
      <p>Epimedin C is a major flavonoid glycoside derived from <italic toggle="yes">Herba epimedii</italic>, which is able to modulate the immune response by increasing lymphocyte proliferation and production of <italic toggle="yes">IL-2</italic> in a murine model [<xref rid="pone.0283728.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, previous reports have only described the anti-PRRSV activity of HuangQi, BanLanGen and YinYangHuo separately; it remains to be confirmed whether the formulation of FZJDS has potent antiviral affects against PRRSV.</p>
      <p>Network pharmacology is a new discipline that integrates transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics to provide a powerful tool for researchers to determine the therapeutic mechanism and clarify the multiple components and targets of specific compounds from TCM. Using the tool of network pharmacology, it has been reported that the LianHuaQingWen herbal compound possesses the ability to modulate the inflammatory response, has proven anti-COVID-19 effects, and the capability to repair lung injury [<xref rid="pone.0283728.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Network pharmacology analysis also found that the ShuangHuangLian oral liquid had therapeutic anti-inflammatory properties and antiviral activity against COVID-19 [<xref rid="pone.0283728.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In another study, the network pharmacology technique along with experimental validation provided evidence that the Qingfei oral liquid (QF) was effective in the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus-induced lung inflammation through its action on the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway [<xref rid="pone.0283728.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Active ingredients based on total flavones were shown to provide profound protection against pulmonary influenza A virus (IAV) infection by alleviating inflammatory responses, decreasing signaling through the MAPK pathway and expediting viral eradication [<xref rid="pone.0283728.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The distinct superiority of network pharmacological analysis ensures that we can directly achieve experimental verification based on the results returned by the network analysis. Thus, a network pharmacologic approach was used to predict the FZJDS targets and gene interactions necessary for effective therapy against PRRSV. Our research provides additional insights into the physiological action of FZJDS, which should stimulate improvements in the formulation for better anti-PRRSV outcomes, and will serve as a useful reference for exploring the therapeutic mechanisms of other traditional Chinese medicines.</p>

        <p>In this study, the traditional Chinese medicine systems pharmacology database, <bold>TCMSP</bold>, (<ext-link xlink:href="https://old.tcmsp-e.com/tcmsp.php" ext-link-type="uri">https://old.tcmsp-e.com/tcmsp.php</ext-link>) [<xref rid="pone.0283728.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], the encyclopedia of traditional Chinese medicine, <bold>ETCM</bold> (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.tcmip.cn/ETCM/index.php/Home/" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.tcmip.cn/ETCM/index.php/Home/</ext-link>), and a high-throughput experiment- and reference-guided database of traditional Chinese medicine, <bold>HERB</bold> (<ext-link xlink:href="http://herb.ac.cn/" ext-link-type="uri">http://herb.ac.cn/</ext-link>) were consulted to identify the chemical components of FZJDS. The parameters of oral bioavailability (OB) &gt;30% and drug likeness (DL) &gt;0.18 were set up as the criteria in TCMSP to screen for active ingredients. The ingredients collected in the ETCM database were divided into three categories according to a quantitative estimate of drug likeness (QED): weak (QED&lt;0.49), moderate (0.49&#x2264;QED&#x2264;0.67) and good (QED&gt;0.67). We limited the search to a drug likeness of moderate to good. The HERB database was used to supplement the first two, and a list of potential targets of the identified components was obtained from these three databases after deleting repetitive targets.</p>

      <sec id="sec008">
        <title>2.2. Potential PRRVS targets of FZJDS</title>
        <p>All specific PRRVS targets were obtained from a search of the human genetic database, <bold>GeneCards</bold> (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.genecards.org/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.genecards.org/</ext-link>), the comparative toxicogenomics database, <bold>CTD</bold> (<ext-link xlink:href="http://ctdbase.org/" ext-link-type="uri">http://ctdbase.org/</ext-link>), and the online Mendelian inheritance in man platform, <bold>OMIM</bold> (<ext-link xlink:href="http://omim.org/" ext-link-type="uri">http://omim.org/</ext-link>) [<xref rid="pone.0283728.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. These databases illuminate the relationship between targets and diseases from different perspectives. GeneCards is a free, authoritative, comprehensive database which provides genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, etc. CTD contains accurate data and descriptions of chemical/gene/protein interactions and relationships between specific chemicals and diseases across species, as well as genetic associations with diseases. OMIM focuses on the association between disease phenotypes and the genes linked to disease etiology and progression. Potential targets were subjected to further analysis after removing repetitive items [<xref rid="pone.0283728.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p>

        <title>2.3. Construction of protein-protein interaction network and screening of core targets</title>
        <p>The general targets of the active ingredients of FZJDS and the specific PRRSV-related targets were compared to obtain a Venn diagram of common potential targets for FZJDS treatment of PRRS. The FZJDS active ingredient targets and PRRSV-specific targets were imported into VENNY2.1 (<ext-link xlink:href="https://bioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/" ext-link-type="uri">https://bioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/</ext-link>) for visualization. Then, the STRING database (<ext-link xlink:href="https://string-db.org/" ext-link-type="uri">https://string-db.org/</ext-link>) [<xref rid="pone.0283728.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] was used to construct a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network by overlapping the drug-related targets with the PRRSV targets. Species were limited to <italic toggle="yes">Sus scrofa</italic> with a minimum required interaction score &gt;0.4. Other parameters in the study were included at their default setting. The TSV formatted file was downloaded from the STRING database and imported into Cytoscape 3.7.2 (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.cytoscape.org/" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.cytoscape.org/</ext-link>) [<xref rid="pone.0283728.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], which is an open-source software platform that is used for visualizing complicated biomolecular networks and integrating different types of attribute data. A build-in module, CytoCNA, was utilized to generate major network targets when the &#x201C;between-ness&#x201D;, closeness and degree of each node were all larger than the median. Core target networks were generated from major target networks by topological analysis.</p>

A total of 82 compounds were collected from the TCMSP, HERB and ETCM databases. Out of these 82 compounds, 20 were from HuangQi, 39 from BanLanGen, and 23 were from YinYangHuo. After removing duplications and combining, the search results were collected from the OMIM, CTD and GeneCards databases. A total of 880 corresponding potential therapeutic targets were found and transformed to gene symbols using the STRING database. By performing an intersection comparison between the drug targets and the disease-associated targets, 30 common core genes shared between FZJDS and PRRSV were identified (<bold><xref rid="pone.0283728.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref></bold>).</p>

        <p>In the present study, Cytoscape 3.7.2 was used to construct a network of the 30 core targets in common of the active ingredients in FZJDS and the PRRSV. The resulting network had 83 nodes and 312 edges, and the connections between the nodes indicated the relationships among the active ingredients and viral targets (<bold><xref rid="pone.0283728.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref></bold>). The more connections, the more important the nodes are in the network. From the network, 52 active compounds with 30 corresponding hub targets were identified. More importantly, by further analyzing the degrees of each node, we found that quercetin, kaempferol and luteolin were likely the key active compounds of FZJDS.

        <title>3.3. GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analysis</title>
        <p>The 30 core intersecting genes were submitted for GO and KEGG enrichment analysis by using DAVID. GO analysis yielded entries comprising 122 biological processes (BPs), 7 cellular components (CCs) and 21 molecular functions (MFs). Different categories of BP, CC, and MF are represented by green, orange and purple bars, respectively. The height of the bar represents the enrichment score observed in the category. By setting the filter for <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&lt;0.05, the top 10 terms significantly enriched in BPs and MFs were obtained according to fold-enrichment from high to low. All CC categories are displayed visually, and 25 significantly enriched GO terms were obtained (<bold><xref rid="pone.0283728.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref></bold>). A total of 101 terms were obtained from KEGG pathway enrichment analysis by using DAVID data (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.01, FDR &lt; 0.05). The results showed that these target genes were in the pathways related to viral infection, the differentiation of immune cells and signal transduction pathways, as well as associated with important pathological processes such as apoptosis. The top 20 entries were selected according to the <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> value and are shown as a bubble diagram (<bold><xref rid="pone.0283728.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref></bold>). As shown in <bold><xref rid="pone.0283728.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref></bold>, the main signaling pathways included PI3K/Akt, JAK-STAT, NF-&#x138;B, sphingolipid, Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation, and relaxin. The top 20 pathways with lower <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> and greater gene enrichment are listed in <bold><xref rid="pone.0283728.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref></bold>. Lastly, the herbs and 30 core targets were mapped onto the top 20 corresponding pathways, (<bold><xref rid="pone.0283728.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref></bold>).</p>

        <p>In this study, it was noted that incubating MARC-145 cells with FZJDS under serum deprivation affected cell morphology. Furthermore, the cytotoxicity of FZJDS on MARC-145 cells was determined by CCK-8 assay. FZJDS did not significantly reduce MARC-145 viability at concentrations up to 16.00 mg/mL, but some cytotoxicity did occur above that (<bold><xref rid="pone.0283728.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0283728.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref></bold>). These results demonstrate that FZJDS has minimal cytotoxicity on MARC-145 cells within the tested dose range accompany with a dose-dependent manner. FZJDS inhibited PRRSV in a dose-dependent manner and had a selectivity index (SI) greater than 10 (<bold><xref rid="pone.0283728.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref></bold>).</p>

As shown in (<bold><xref rid="pone.0283728.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A and 7B</xref></bold>), treatment with FZJDS results in a significant dose-dependent and time-dependence reduction in PRRSV N mRNA levels both in MARC-145 cells.

        <p>In the present study, results of network pharmacology were verified by western blotting and qRT-PCR.

        <title>3.7. FZJDS inhibits PRRSV-induced apoptosis of MARC-145 cells</title>
        <p>Our results showed that FZJDS inhibited expression of the apoptotic protein, Bax, and promoted the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-2, in MARC-145 cells. To investigate whether FZJDS inhibited PRRSV-induced apoptosis of MARC-145 cells, PRRSV-infected cells were treated with different concentrations of FZJDS and the apoptosis rate was measured by flow cytometry 48 h later. The results showed that apoptosis in MARC-145 cells infected with PRRSV was significantly lower with FZJDS treatment than in the untreated group. The apoptosis rate in infected MARC-145 cells decreased with increasing FZJDS concentration (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.01; <bold><xref rid="pone.0283728.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9</xref></bold>).</p>

        <p>To explore whether FZJDS exerted anti-apoptotic effects by affecting JNK, we compared the levels of JNK protein after inhibitor treatment. MARC-145 cells were first infected with PRRSV and then treated with an inhibitor to block the phosphorylation of JNK. After 48 h, flow cytometry was used to measure the effects of JNK signaling pathway inhibition on apoptosis induced by PRRSV. The results showed that compared with the control group, the apoptosis rate was markedly reduced at an FZJDS concentration of 7.81 mg/mL, with a maximum at a dose of 15.63 mg/ mL (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&lt;0.0001; <bold><xref rid="pone.0283728.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10A&#x2013;10E</xref></bold>).

      <title>4. Discussion</title>
      <p>Although PRRSV has been well controlled in China, side effects and antimicrobial resistance has been caused by the inappropriate application of drugs. Traditional Chinese medicine is a complementary and alternative approach involving many components acting via multiple mechanisms and targets. In addition to the antiviral function, the medications also regulate the host immune response to provide a synergistic effect. The TCM philosophy encourages holistic treatment with a systematic approach that leads to better therapeutic outcomes and fewer side effects. To study this process in more detail, we employed a systems pharmacology method to elucidate the potential pharmacological mechanism of FJZD&#x2019;s effect on PRRSV infection.</p>
      <p>In this study, we conducted a systematic study using a combination of network pharmacology and experimental verification. The several compounds in FZJDS can affect multiple targets. Overlapping targets were identified for the different compounds, and it was apparent that FZJDS exerts an anti-PRRSV action through the synergistic effects of its compounds. Our results showed that quercetin, kaempferol, luteolin, acacetin and formononetin were the top five active ingredients affecting the intersecting targets. A previous study showed that quercetin significantly suppressed porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection at non-cytotoxic concentrations, by exerting an inhibitory effect on PEDV 3CLpro [<xref rid="pone.0283728.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Another study reported that BanLanGen exhibited significant inhibitory activity against various subtypes of avian influenza viruses (IC50 = 0.39&#x2013;4.3 mg/ml) and also inhibited degradation of I&#x3BA;B&#x3B1; and production of PGE2, NO, and IL-6 in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 monocytes [<xref rid="pone.0283728.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Western blotting was performed to measure the expression of COX-2, cleaved caspase-3, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-&#x3B3; (PPAR-&#x3B3;), indicated that formononetin could protect against ox-LDL-induced inflammatory reactions, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in human vascular endothelial cells, HUVECs [<xref rid="pone.0283728.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. YinYangHuo enhanced the immune system by improving the response of spleen antibody-forming cells to near normal, upregulating lymphocyte proliferation and promoting the recovery of <italic toggle="yes">IL-2</italic> production [<xref rid="pone.0283728.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In viral and post-viral entry experiments, luteolin significantly blocked foot-and-mouth-disease virus (FMDV) growth at low 50% effective concentrations (EC50), and could reduce the viral load as determined by RT-qPCR [<xref rid="pone.0283728.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Taken together, these results support the idea that the active compounds in FZJDS have synergistic antiviral effects.</p>
      <p>In the present study, GO enrichment and KEGG pathways enrichment analysis were carried out to explore the multi-dimensional pharmacological mechanism of FZJDS. After removing human diseases, we analyzed the pathways with more annotation genes and a lower <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-value. Among these pathways, the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, sphingolipid signaling pathway and JAK-STAT signaling pathway are the main pathways with the highest enrichment scores. Among these pathways, FZJDS mainly interfered with the occurrence and development of PRRSV through the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. This was in agreement with other research suggesting that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-mediated SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudovirions (SCV-2-S) infection induced autophagy and apoptosis in human bronchial epithelial and microvascular endothelial cells. SCV-2-S inhibited the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway by upregulating intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, thus promoting the autophagic response [<xref rid="pone.0283728.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. One study demonstrated that involvement of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in megakaryocyte development and maturation was confirmed with the use of specific inhibitors in Dengue virus-infected MEG-01 cells [<xref rid="pone.0283728.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The expression of NF-&#x3BA;B p65, p-NF-&#x3BA;B and p65 was increased with favipiravir treatment, implying that the antiviral effectivity of favipiravir against peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) is mediated by the JAK/STAT and PI3K/AKT pathways [<xref rid="pone.0283728.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. A recent genome-wide mRNA and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) search and analysis in PRRSV-infected PTR2 showed that PRRSV infection could inhibit the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and trigger apoptosis [<xref rid="pone.0283728.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Another study determined the phosphorylation status of Akt during infection of MARC-145 cells with the highly pathogenic PRRSV strain, HuN4, and provided new evidence of a novel role for the PI3K/Akt pathway in PRRSV infection [<xref rid="pone.0283728.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. These evidence showed that the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway played an important role in regulating apoptosis FZJDS has enormous potential for application in animal husbandry due to its remarkable immunomodulatory effects and antiviral activity.</p>
      <p>We found that Bax, Bcl-2, TLR4 and p53 as the core target proteins of FZJDS in response to PRRSV infection of MARC-145 cells was also predicted from the network pharmacology analysis. As previously described by Lenka Kavanov&#xE1;, (2017), monocyte derived macrophages infected with PRRSV could significantly increase the mRNA expression of pro-apoptotic genes, such as <italic toggle="yes">bad</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Bax</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">p53</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0283728.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Recent evidence suggests that PRRSV infection aggravated the morphological depletion of tight junction proteins and increased <italic toggle="yes">IL-1&#x3B2;</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">IL-6</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">IL-8</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">TNF-&#x3B1;</italic> expression by activating the NF-&#x3BA;B signaling pathway in the jejunum [<xref rid="pone.0283728.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Another previous study showed specific host transcriptome differences in porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) at seven days post-challenge. In Tongcheng (TC) pigs, 549 specific differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, including VAV2, Bcl-2 and Bax, which were enriched in activation of leukocyte extravasation and suppression of apoptosis [<xref rid="pone.0283728.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Mice infected with adapted influenza A virus (IAV) H1N1 strain A/Font Monmouth were treated with protocatechuic acid (PCA). PCA reduced infiltration of immune cells and cytokine levels in the lung, as well as suppressed H1N1-induced TLR4/NF-&#x3BA;B activation [<xref rid="pone.0283728.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. These results are in agreement with our network pharmacology results showing the core predicted targets of FZJDS in treating PRRSV-induced apoptosis. We also observed the effects on apoptosis related genes, Bax, Bcl-2, TLR-4, JNK and I&#x138;Ba, by real-time qRT-PCR and western blotting. In addition, a recent research report showed that PRRSV replicated in the lungs and small intestine and that the PRRSV N protein was detected in the lung interstitial and jejunal mucosa [<xref rid="pone.0283728.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. We measured the expression level of N protein by western blotting in our present study, and showed that it decreased in proportion to the FZJDS dose used in the treatment.</p>
      <p>We also found that the <italic toggle="yes">JNK</italic> inhibitor, SP600125, inhibited PRRSV-mediated apoptosis by activation of the downstream protein, I&#x138;Ba. The inhibition of JNK not only significantly inhibited virus-induced autophagosome formation, but also suppressed replication of the corresponding virus [<xref rid="pone.0283728.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In this study, FZJDS decreased phosphorylation of P65, JNK, and I&#x138;Ba in MARC-145 cells, and decreased the expression of TLR4 and Bax. In previous studies immunoprecipitation assays have revealed that BEFV disrupted Beclin 1 and Bcl-2 interaction by JNK-mediated Bcl-2 phosphorylation, thereby activating autophagy [<xref rid="pone.0283728.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], which proves that JNK and Bcl-2 are core proteins affecting PRRSV. Activated JNK translocates to the mitochondria where it phosphorylates Bcl-2/Bcl-xL and antagonizes the anti-apoptotic activity of Bcl-2/Bcl-xL. Moreover, JNK expression leads to the release of cytochrome C via a bid-bax-dependent mechanism, activating caspase 9 and caspase 3 and inducing apoptosis [<xref rid="pone.0283728.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], consistent with our findings. In view of the above results, we speculate that the active compounds of FJZDS target genes related to the pathways that inhibit apoptosis such as the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, and FZJDS plays an important role in protecting MARC-145 cells from apoptosis through PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, suggesting that FZJDS exerted its antiviral effects through inhibiting multiple cytokines and proteins.</p>
      <p>In summary, our findings suggest that the protective mechanism of FZJDS against PRRSV is related to the activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway through TLR4, Bax, JNK, Bcl-2 and I&#x138;Ba, and that the main active ingredients are quercetin, kaempferol and luteolin. This is the first study that comprehensively analyzed the main compounds, targets, and pathways of FZJDS in treating PRRSV utilizing a network pharmacology approach together with experimental validation, which supports FZJDS as an alternative therapy for treating PRRSV infection.</p>

      <p>Reviewer #1:&#xA0;In order to investigate the antiviral effect of Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) , this manuscript uses a network pharmacological approach and finds that some key biomolecules are associated with the antiviral effect of PRRSV.</p>
      <p>on the basis of network pharmacology research, using cytological method, respectively, to drug toxicity, antiviral activity, the study found that some of the key effect on molecular level, The anti - apoptosis effect has been studied and many results have been obtained. These results suggest that the anti-PRRSV effect of FZJDS is mainly through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which provides some information on the molecular basis of the antiviral effect of FZJDS.</p>
      <p>In this study, the method of network pharmacology was comprehensively introduced, which made the study more reproducible, which was the obvious advantage of this study.</p>
      <p>There are still some problems with this manuscript that deserve serious consideration by the authors.</p>
      <p>Although network pharmacology provides important information about molecular interaction, it is difficult to make a comparative analysis between network pharmacology research and cytological research because of the huge difference between kidney cells &#xFF08;MARC&#x2010; 145 cells derived from African green monkey kidney&#xFF09;selected and immune cells mainly from antiviral infection in cytological experiments.</p>
      <p>The initial concentration of the drug was 125mg, because the use of multiple dilution resulted in the subsequent dose showing two decimal places&#xFF08;3.91&#xFF0C;7.81mg/L&#xFF0C;I do not think 3.91 is better than 4.0 here.&#xFF09;. This accuracy was not helpful for the analysis and understanding of its pharmacological effect, and the authors should reduce the number of decimal places. It is recommended to choose an initial dose of 128 mg, so that all dilutions are rounded and the numbers are tidy. Research is a very personal job and requires neat habits. (3.4. FZJDS cytotoxicity test on MarC-145 cells)</p>
      <p>In order to determine the antiviral effect of the drug, an antiviral drug should also be used as a positive control, which is relatively easy to achieve for cell studies and can be more clearly illustrated. (3.5, Figure 6)</p>
      <p>The effects of FZJDS on uninfected cells were studied, but these effects were not analyzed. These effects are also necessary to analyze drug effects, so as to avoid non-specific concomitant effects. (3.6)</p>
      <p>There is no need to discuss the results in the results section. These should be in the discussion section of the paper. Line 413 The Experimental Results supported The hypothesis that FZJDS Inhibited Apoptosis by regulating JNK Activation.)</p>
      <p>To reinforce the evidence for the conclusion of this manuscript, the antiviral effect of pJNK inhibitors could be analyzed.</p>
      <p>Reviewer #2:&#xA0;The manuscript by Chang et al reported that Fuzhengjiedu San (FZJDS), has been extensively used to treat viral diseases in pigs. Quercetin, kaempferol, and luteolin were the main active compounds of FZJDS. FZJDS significantly reduced the expression of P65, JNK, TLR4, N protein, Bax and I&#x138;Ba in MARC-145 cells, and increased the expression of Bcl-2, consistent with network pharmacology results. FZJDS has significant antiviral activity through its effects on the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. We conclude that FZJDS is a promising candidate herbal formulation for treating PRRSV and deserves further investigation. Nevertheless, there are many Major Compulsory Revisions to be faced before the manuscript could be considered for publication.</p>
      <p>The content of this paper is complex and the logic is not clear, thus the manuscript is difficult to follow.</p>
      <p>1. The description of Fuzhengjiedu San is not appropriate</p>
      <p>2. The antiviral effects of FZJDS were only tested in Marc-145 cell, which is originated from green monkey. The natural target cell of PRRSV is PAM, the authors should use PAM to perform assays to demonstrate the anti-PRRSV activity of FZJDS.</p>
      <p>3. The cytotoxicity of FZJDS on Marc-145 should be shown in graph rather than table. Further, the authors should calculate the CC50 of the drug.</p>
      <p>4. In Figure 6C and E, the inhibitory effect of FZJDS on PRRSV replication is very weak, indicating that the drug may not be used for PRRSV control.</p>
      <p>5. The authors also should calculate the IC50, which is indispensable for antiviral drug research.</p>
      <p>6. The level of p-p65 in mock treatment is very high and is almost comparable to that of PRRSV infection groups. Commonly the p-p65 level in mock group is very low or cannot be detectable. This phenomenon is also observed in the level of p-JNK and p-IkBalpha. The data are questionable.</p>
      <p>7. The data of bioinformatics shown in Figures 1-5 are too complex and difficult to follow, which makes the logic of the paper not clear.</p>
      <p>8. Quality of written English: Not suitable for publication unless extensively edited.</p>

As below, on behalf of my co-authors, I would like to clarify all the points raised by the reviewers. And we hope the reviewers and the editors will be satisfied with our responses to the comments and the revisions for the original manuscript.</p>
      <p>The main corrections in the paper and the responds to the reviewer&#x2019;s comments are as flowing:</p>
      <p>Responds to the reviewer&#x2019;s comments:</p>
      <p>Reviewer #1:</p>
      <p>1.Although network pharmacology provides important information about molecular interaction, it is difficult to make a comparative analysis between network pharmacology research and cytological research because of the huge difference between kidney cells &#xFF08;MARC&#x2010; 145 cells derived from African green monkey kidney&#xFF09;selected and immune cells mainly from antiviral infection in cytological experiments.</p>
      <p>Ans: Thank you for your comment. In the present study, we selected sus scrofa species during the network pharmacologic analysis, besides previous studies have been widely elucidated that the mechanism of PRRSV infection on swine by the MARC&#x2010;145 cell line. In a study reported from Xun Wang et al found that tea polyphenol effectively inhibited PRRSV infection in Marc-145 cells by suppressing the stages of viral attachment, internalization, replication and release (Xun Wang et al. 2021). In line with previous publications showed that whole-genome transcriptome analysis of PRRSV-infected Marc-145 cells, which provides insight into the dynamics of host gene regulation during PRRSV infection (Ying Wei et al. 2018), as well as proved that PRRSV induced micropinocytosis via TIM-1 in MARC-145 cells (Xin Wei et al. 2020). Moreover, a proteomic study revealed that PRRSV virions incorporate a variety of simian proteins after replication in MARC-145 cells, which raises the intriguing possibility that cross-neutralization of PRRSV strains may, in particular, be mediated by antibodies recognizing simian antigen (David Goldeck et al. 2019). Previous findings suggest that the role of the plasma membrane cholesterol in PRRSV infection of MARC-145 cells was investigated by Ying Sun et al (2011). While knockdown of DHX36 and its adaptor myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) by small-interfering RNA in MARC-145 cells significantly reduced NF-kB activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression after PRRSV infection (Huiyuan Jing et al. 2017). Therefore, we used MARC&#x2010;145 cells in the present study for the cytological research validation.</p>
      <p>We all totally agree with immune cells used to clarify the PRRSV infection mechanisms, rather than only either the MARC-145 cells or the immune effects. In the further research ,we'll both use immune cells for the mechanism study. Thanks for your suggestions again.</p>

      <p>2.The initial concentration of the drug was 125 mg, because the use of multiple dilution resulted in the subsequent dose showing two decimal places&#xFF08;3.91&#xFF0C;7.81mg/L&#xFF0C;I do not think 3.91 is better than 4.0 here.&#xFF09;. This accuracy was not helpful for the analysis and understanding of its pharmacological effect, and the authors should reduce the number of decimal places. It is recommended to choose an initial dose of 128 mg, so that all dilutions are rounded and the numbers are tidy. Research is a very personal job and requires neat habits.</p>
      <p>Ans: Thank you for your suggestion. It has been revised.</p>
      <p>3.In order to determine the antiviral effect of the drug, an antiviral drug should also be used as a positive control, which is relatively easy to achieve for cell studies and can be more clearly illustrated. (3.5, Figure 6)</p>
      <p>Ans: Thank you for your suggestion. Previous study by Liu Lan et al. (2016), Ma Xia et al.(2015) has proved that FZJDS plays an important role in anti-infectious Bursal Disease Virus(IBDV). Moreover, Guangwen Dai et al. (2017) described that FZJDS has a certain cure rate in pigs with clinical infection of PRRSV, Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) and Pseudorabies virus (PRV). Therefore, in the present study we only test the different concentration of FZJDS effect on PRRSV infection cell model, which would like to select the best and safest concentration by the cell viability. In particular, in previous studies it has been confirmed by Zhengtu Li et al. (2017) found that the polysaccharide extract from Radix isatidis root can be used as an adjunct to antiviral therapy for the IAV infection and LH-C might be an option for treating influenza virus infection(Yuewen Ding, 2017) without positive control. Therefore, no positive control is used in this study. We sincerely grateful all the reviewers' comment on the positive control group in the experiment design and will adding the positive controls in the following studies.</p>

      <p>4.The effects of FZJDS on uninfected cells were studied, but these effects were not analyzed. These effects are also necessary to analyze drug effects, so as to avoid non-specific concomitant effects.(3.6)</p>
      <p>Ans: Thank you for your comment. In the present study, we analyzed the effects of FZJDS on uninfected cells in the mock group by western blot. Furthermore, we revised the discussion part hoping it better to elucidate the non-specific concomitant effects. We will be happy to edit the text further on the feedback comments on this study.</p>
      <p>Reviewer #2: </p>
      <p>1.The antiviral effects of FZJDS were only tested in Marc-145 cell, which is originated from green monkey. The natural target cell of PRRSV is PAM, the authors should use PAM to perform assays to demonstrate the anti-PRRSV activity of FZJDS.</p>
      <p>Ans: Thank you for your comment. In the present study, we selected sus scrofa species during the network pharmacologic analysis, besides previous studies have been widely elucidated that the mechanism of PRRSV infection on swine by the MARC&#x2010;145 cell line.

      <p>2.The cytotoxicity of FZJDS on Marc-145 should be shown in graph rather than table. Further, the authors should calculate the CC50 of the drug.</p>
      <p>Ans: Thank you for your suggestion. We calculate CC50 value and add some necessary information on cytotoxicity in this manuscript.</p>
      <p>Supplementary Figure 1. Cytotoxicity of FZJDS on MARC-145 cells. (a) 24 hour FZJDS treatment group. (b) 36 hour FZJDS treatment group. (c) 48 hour FZJDS treatment group. (d) 72 hour FZJDS treatment group.</p>
      <p>3.The authors also should calculate the IC50, which is indispensable for antiviral drug research.</p>
      <p>Ans: Thank you for your suggestion. The IC50 value has been added.</p>
      <p>4.In Figure 6C and E, the inhibitory effect of FZJDS on PRRSV replication is very weak, indicating that the drug may not be used for PRRSV control.</p>
      <p>Ans: Thank you for your comment. We double check and analysis the results of N protein by Image J software, which is a marker response to PRRSV infection. When Marc-145 cells added without or with FZJDS as the negative and positive control group, compared with only PRRSV positive control group, the content of N protein was significantly increased.</p>
      <p>5.The level of p-p65 in mock treatment is very high and is almost comparable to that of PRRSV infection groups. Commonly the p-p65 level in mock group is very low or cannot be detectable. This phenomenon is also observed in the level of p-JNK and p-IkBalpha. The data are questionable.</p>
      <p>Ans: We apologize for the mistake of phosphorylated proteins band in mock group intensity analysis in the manuscript. We re-analyzed on this results carefully, hoping it is better for understanding. </p>
      <p>6.The data of bioinformatics shown in Figures 1-5 are too complex and difficult to follow, which makes the logic of the paper not clear.</p>
      <p>Ans: Thank you for your comment. According to the analytical steps of network pharmacology, we list all the necessary results in line with the titles of each sections. Consistent with previous studies suggested that network pharmacology bioinformatics results in our study (Wenjun Zhou et al. 2021,Haoran Guo et al. 2021,Huahe Zhu et al. 2021). All the study demonstrate that network pharmacology is an effective tool for the discovery of natural compounds with specific properties and determination of their possible mechanisms. We will be happy to edit the text on the detailed comments on the network pharmacology results in this study.</p>

      <p>Reviewer #1:&#xA0;In order to investigate the mechanism of FZJDS against Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), this study used network pharmacology to predict the possible active ingredients and possible mechanisms of FZJDS. It was found that quercetin, kaempferol and luteolin in this drug may be the active ingredients. The (PI3K)/Akt pathway is considered to be a cellular target. For example, the expression levels of a variety of related proteins and genes were analyzed by molecular biology methods and compared with Internet drug studies. The results showed that FZJDS had significant antiviral activity by affecting the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.</p>
      <p>The (PI3K)/Akt pathway is a relatively good consideration to study the antiviral effect of traditional Chinese medicine in this study. However, there are some problems with the hypothesis and design that the authors should pay attention to.</p>
      <p>1 The key evidence to study the antiviral effect of drugs is the influence of drugs on the proliferation level of the virus. After cells are infected with the virus, PCR or cell staining can be used for quantitative analysis of the virus, so as to preliminarily determine the antiviral effect of drugs. This study is only from the perspective of the cell effect of the virus, lacking the most critical antiviral effect. This does not meet the basic requirements of a complete scientific story.</p>
      <p>2 The antiviral effect of cells should not be the primary function of the (PI3K)/Akt pathway, which is a key pathway for cell survival and, of course, one of the phenomena studied in this manuscript, the reduction of apoptosis effect. There are also more downstream molecules involved in the process of viral infection. For example, the mTOR gene can reduce the cell vitality of influenza virus infection, and the downregulation of its gene can enhance cell apoptosis. The downregulation of the gene expression can also reduce the virus titer in cells, indicating that mTOR can maintain the cell vitality of influenza virus infection and negatively regulate the apoptosis of influenza virus infection cells. The effective replication of influenza virus is ensured by maintaining cell viability and reducing cell apoptosis. The down-regulation of GSK-3&#x3B2; gene expression can reduce and increase the cell viability of influenza virus infection</p>
      <p>The apoptosis induced by strong influenza virus decreased the titer of influenza virus in cells, suggesting that GSK-3&#x3B2; had a negative regulatory effect on apoptosis and promoted the replication of influenza virus by maintaining the vitality of host cells. All of these molecules are downstream of the (PI3K)/Akt pathway and are conducive to viral infection, but generally do not have antiviral effects. For example, studies have shown that Shufeng Xuanfei recipe and Jiebiao Qingli recipe can significantly down-regulate the mRNA transcription levels of AKT, Fas, FasL and Caspase-9 in the signaling pathway, and reduce the protein expression levels of AKT, Fas and FasL, thus playing an anti-influenza role.</p>
      <p>3 There are two types of cellular antiviral effects. One is the production of molecules that kill the virus, such as antibodies and interferon. Instead, the cell commits suicide, allowing the infected virus to disappear along with the cell. From this perspective, the signaling pathways that promote cell survival are not conducive to the antiviral purposes of multicellular organisms.</p>
      <p>Has a network pharmacological approach been used to study the antiviral molecular basis of this drug, but the effect of this drug on the (PI3K)/Akt pathway has not been found? How does the author explain why similar research methods and objectives produce such different conclusions?DOI:10.16466/j.issn1005-5509.2020.08.012.</p>

      <p>Dear editor and reviewer,</p>
      <p>We greatly appreciate the reviewer&#x2019;s detailed and valuable comments on our manuscript entitled &#x201C;Fuzhengjiedu San inhibits porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus by activating the PI3K/AKT pathway&#x201D; (ID: PONE-D-22-18907). On behalf of my coauthors, I would like to clarify our responses below to all the points raised by the reviewers. We hope that the reviewers and the editor will be satisfied with the changes and additions made to the original manuscript in the revised file. Their critiques have made the paper better and we thank you again for your kind consideration.</p>
      <p>The responses to the reviewer&#x2019;s comments and details of the corrections follow:</p>
      <p>Reviewer #1</p>
      <p>1. The key evidence to study the antiviral effect of drugs is the influence of drugs on the proliferation level of the virus. After cells are infected with the virus, PCR or cell staining can be used for quantitative analysis of the virus, so as to preliminarily determine the antiviral effect of drugs. This study is only from the perspective of the cell effect of the virus, lacking the most critical antiviral effect. This does not meet the basic requirements of a complete scientific story.</p>
      <p>Ans: Thank you for your comment. We strongly agree with your suggestion about quantitating viral proliferation to make a more complete story and this is planned for the follow-up study. In the present study, we followed the pattern of previously published work and used RT-qPCR and western blotting to determine the inhibitory effects of FZJDS on PRRSV, in line with other researchers&#x2019; methods for testing the antiviral effect. For example, Ruansit, et al. [1] evaluated the in vitro antiviral activities and the ex vivo immunomodulatory effects of Houttuynia cordata Thunb through RT-qPCR, and the in vitro MTT assay was used by Jiang, et al. [2] to measure the effect of Isatis root polysaccharide on PRRSV infection. To assess the inhibitory activity of another key component of FZJDS, RT-qPCR was employed by Su Ke et al. [3] to determine the effect of radix isatidis on the replication pathway and proliferation of PRRSV. Our current study followed previous experimental methods, but we do plan to perform cell staining in a subsequent analysis of the antiviral effect and determine actual viral titers. Thanks again for this valuable suggestion.</p>

      <p>Ans: Thank you for taking the time to make this detailed comment. Your insights and information were very helpful for revising and improving our paper. In this study, the key reason why we selected the PI3K/AKT pathway is that it was the predominant result indicated by KEGG enrichment analysis as well as involved the core proteins most associated with PRRSV infection. Based on references from pharmacological network searching, the PI3K/AKT pathway was most often selected to verify antiviral activity by western immunoblotting and flow cytometry. A recent genome-wide mRNA and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) search and analysis in PRRSV-infected PTR2 showed that PRRSV infection could inhibit the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and trigger apoptosis [1]. Another study determined the phosphorylation status of Akt during infection of MARC-145 cells with the highly pathogenic PRRSV strain, HuN4, and provided new evidence of a novel role for the PI3K/Akt pathway in PRRSV infection [2]. Thus, we have modified the discussion section to include Bax, Bcl-2, TLR4 and p53, which have been identified as the core target proteins of FZJDS, in line with a previous report that protocatechuic acid suppressed H1N1-induced TLR4/NF-&#x3BA;B activation [3]. Previous studies revealed that bovine ephemeral fever virus disrupted Beclin 1 and Bcl-2 interaction by JNK-mediated Bcl-2 phosphorylation, thereby activating autophagy [4], which proves that JNK and Bcl-2 are among the chief proteins affecting PRRSV proliferation. Activated JNK translocates to the mitochondria where it phosphorylates Bcl-2/Bcl-xL and antagonizes the anti-apoptotic activity of Bcl-2/Bcl-xL. We incorporated these results into the present study discussion in hopes of clarifying the antiviral mechanism according to your comments and making the paper better. We would be happy to take any further feedback.</p>

      <p>Ans: We greatly appreciate your insightful comments and suggestions. We have read the article (DOI:10.16466/j.issn1005-5509.2020.08.012.) and found that the main components of the Fuzheng Jiedu formulation used in that study were white Rhizoma atrictyloides, tangerine peel, parsnip, licorice, patchouli, Astragalus membranaceus, honeysuckle and forsythiae. However, the Fuzheng Jiedu San used by us is a combination of Isatis root, Astragalus membranaceus and Herba medii. Due to significant differences in drug compatibility as delineated by network pharmacological analysis, the components, targets and pathways of these formulations are totally different. </p>
      <p>The drug compatibility of traditional Chinese medicine preparations may increase or decrease according to the disease, and there has been no network pharmacological antiviral study on a formulation with the same components as used in this study; however, there have been reports on related single drugs such as from Abelmoschus manihot that can inhibit IAV-induced lung inflammation [1]. A network pharmacology investigation of the anti-inflammatory and antiviral effects of Isatis indigotica identified lignans that might regulate the immune system by targeting IL-2 and the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway [2]. Radix isatidis was analyzed through network pharmacology technology and it was found that COVID-19 could be inhibited by targeting the signaling pathways involving receptors for advanced glycation end products, interleukin-17, tumor necrosis factor, sphingolipids, and p53 [3].</p>

      <p>Reviewer #1:&#xA0;The general principle of the treatment of viral infection in pigs should also consider the economic factors, for some malignant infectious virus infection, currently to eliminate the source of infection, environmental disinfection and blocking infection as the basic strategy. From a medical perspective, the search for and exploration of treatable tools still deserves encouragement. This study used TCM compound to study the therapeutic effect of porcine virus infection. Has some value from a veterinary perspective. This study can also provide relevant evidence for the treatment of human virus infection. From the perspective of human clinical order, it also has some significance. However, viral infectious diseases should be carried out around the core issue of viral infection. The present manuscript study is slightly inadequate in this regard.</p>
