World Health Organization (WHO) issued conditional guidelines for mass azithromycin administration in high-mortality settings in sub-Saharan Africa given concerns for antibiotic resistance. While prolonged twice-yearly MDA has been shown to increase antibiotic resistance in small randomized controlled trials, the objective of this study was to determine if macrolide and non-macrolide resistance in the gut increases with the duration of azithromycin MDA in a larger setting.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods and findings</title><p>The <italic toggle="yes">Macrolide Oraux pour R&#xE9;duire les D&#xE9;c&#xE8;s avec un Oeil sur la R&#xE9;sistance</italic> (MORDOR) study was conducted in Niger from December 2014 to June 2020. It was a cluster-randomized trial of azithromycin (A) versus placebo (P) aimed at evaluating childhood mortality. This is a sub-study in the MORDOR trial to track changes in antibiotic resistance after prolonged azithromycin MDA. A total of 594 communities were eligible. Children 1 to 59 months in 163 randomly chosen communities were eligible to receive treatment and included in resistance monitoring. Participants, staff, and investigators were masked to treatment allocation.</p><p>At the conclusion of MORDOR Phase I, by design, all communities received an additional year of twice-yearly azithromycin treatments (Phase II). Thus, at the conclusion of Phase II, the treatment history (1 letter per 6-month period) for the participating communities was either (PP-PP-AA) or (AA-AA-AA). In Phase III, participating communities were then re-randomized to receive either another 3 rounds of azithromycin or placebo, thus resulting in 4 treatment histories: Group 1 (AA-AA-AA-AA-A, <italic toggle="yes">N</italic> = 51), Group 2 (PP-PP-AA-AA-A, <italic toggle="yes">N</italic> = 40), Group 3 (AA-AA-AA-PP-P, <italic toggle="yes">N</italic> = 27), and Group 4 (PP-PP-AA-PP-P, <italic toggle="yes">N</italic> = 32).</p><p>Rectal swabs from each child (<italic toggle="yes">N</italic> = 5,340) were obtained 6 months after the last treatment. Each child contributed 1 rectal swab and these were pooled at the community level, processed for DNA-seq, and analyzed for genetic resistance determinants. The primary prespecified outcome was macrolide resistance determinants in the gut. Secondary outcomes were resistance to beta-lactams and other antibiotic classes. Communities recently randomized to azithromycin (groups 1 and 2) had significantly more macrolide resistance determinants than those recently randomized to placebo (groups 3 and 4) (fold change 2.18, 95% CI 1.5 to 3.51, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">unadj</italic></sub> &lt; 0.001). However, there was no significant increase in macrolide resistance in communities treated 4.5 years (group 1) compared to just the most recent 2.5 years (group 2) (fold change 0.80, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.00, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">adj</italic></sub> = 0.010), or between communities that had been treated for 3 years in the past (group 3) versus just 1 year in the past (group 4) (fold change 1.00, 95% CI 0.78 to 2.35, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">adj</italic></sub> = 0.52). We also found no significant differences for beta-lactams or other antibiotic classes.</p><p>The main limitations of our study were the absence of phenotypic characterization of resistance, no complete placebo arm, and no monitoring outside of Niger limiting generalizability.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this study, we observed that mass azithromycin distribution for childhood mortality among preschool children in Niger increased macrolide resistance determinants in the gut but that resistance may plateau after 2 to 3 years of treatment.

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Mass antibiotic distribution remains the pillar of multiple public health programs, including those championed by the World Health Organization (WHO). Thus far, over 1 billion doses of azithromycin have been distributed to eliminate trachoma, a blinding disease caused by repeated ocular infection with <italic toggle="yes">Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> [<xref rid="pmed.1004386.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Mass azithromycin distribution for childhood mortality is being considered by various sub-Saharan African countries and WHO [<xref rid="pmed.1004386.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004386.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Despite proven benefits, the intervention is not without controversy given the emergence of both phenotypic and genetic evidence of antimicrobial resistance [<xref rid="pmed.1004386.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pmed.1004386.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Concern is for both an increase resistance to macrolides (including azithromycin and erythromycin), but also co-selection to other classes of antibiotics such as beta-lactams (including penicillin resistance).</p>
      <p>Azithromycin for trachoma provides the largest body of evidence for resistance due to mass drug administration (MDA) to date [<xref rid="pmed.1004386.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Communities treated with azithromycin have an increased prevalence of macrolide resistance, which can be phenotypically or genetically detected in <italic toggle="yes">Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Escherichia coli</italic> [<xref rid="pmed.1004386.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pmed.1004386.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Reassuringly, resistance prevalence appears to decrease after MDA discontinuation [<xref rid="pmed.1004386.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Recently, due to the ease of transporting DNA coupled with the relative accessibility of high-throughput sequencing and improved bioinformatics, surveillance for resistance in low-resource settings has benefitted from unbiased genetic analysis. This approach has allowed for the detection of all potential antimicrobial resistance determinants in a given sample and has revealed some unexpected results. In Nigerien children, prolonged twice-yearly azithromycin MDA may have led to the co-selection of other classes of antimicrobial resistance determinants in the gut, including beta-lactams and aminoglycosides [<xref rid="pmed.1004386.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Those findings, however, came from a small subset of communities in the MORDOR study [<xref rid="pmed.1004386.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The continuation of the MORDOR mortality study in Niger provided a unique opportunity to evaluate resistance outcomes with azithromycin MDA in a far larger population. Here, we report the findings of the gut resistome of 5,340 Nigerien preschool children from 150 communities randomized to receive up to 9 twice-yearly azithromycin treatments.</p>

        <title>Trial design</title>
        <p>MORDOR (<italic toggle="yes">Macrolide Oraux pour R&#xE9;duire les D&#xE9;c&#xE8;s avec un Oeil sur la R&#xE9;sistance</italic>, <ext-link xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov" ext-link-type="uri">clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> # NCT02048007) was a cluster-randomized controlled trial that showed a 14% mortality reduction over 2 years of twice-yearly azithromycin MDA in children aged 1 to 59 months in Niger, Malawi, and Tanzania [<xref rid="pmed.1004386.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. It was prespecified that after 2 years, all communities would receive an additional year of azithromycin treatment for all communities (i.e., azithromycin communities would continue to receive 2 more twice-yearly doses of azithromycin and the placebo communities would receive 2 twice-yearly doses of azithromycin; Phase II) [<xref rid="pmed.1004386.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In Phase III, after year 3 (at the conclusion of Phase II), half of the communities were randomized to receive placebo again (<bold>Figure A in</bold>
<xref rid="pmed.1004386.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Appendix</xref>), as there was concern that after cessation of MDA, mortality might increase to even higher levels than pre-MDA, while levels of resistance remained higher than they would have been without MDA. It was in this large mortality study setting of Phase III that communities were randomly selected for rectal sample collection for macrolide and non-macrolide resistance analysis.</p>
        <p>Prior to this sub-study, we monitored for various biomarkers of infection and antibiotic resistance in 30 designated morbidity communities, spanning across the same Dosso region of Niger as the mortality communities in the MORDOR study. The mortality and morbidity studies in MORDOR were parallel trials conducted at the same time. Because childhood mortality is a rare event, the number of mortality communities included in MORDOR was much larger than the number for the morbidity communities (615 communities versus 30 communities). The communities included in this study were themselves part of the large mortality study of MORDOR I, II, and III described above, and thus better reflect the selection for antibiotic resistance where mortality was evaluated as the outcome [<xref rid="pmed.1004386.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004386.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Of the 163 communities asked, 154 communities agreed to sample collection for this sub-study. The trial started in December 2014 and sample collection for this study concluded in January 2020, although the final survey for MORDOR did not conclude until June 2020.</p>

        <title>Ethics statement</title>
        <p>The University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Committee for Human Research and the Ethical Committee of the Niger Ministry of Health provided ethical oversight. Verbal informed consent was obtained from guardians of eligible children. No incentives were offered. All activities followed the Declaration of Helsinki.</p>

      <sec id="sec012">
        <title>Study setting and recruitment</title>
        <p>The trial was conducted in the districts of Boboye and Loga in Niger. Communities participating in MORDOR Phase I trial were informed of the findings and recruited to continue in the study for Phases II and III.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec013">
        <title>Eligibility criteria</title>
        <p>Randomization was at the community level, including communities with a population between 200 to 2,000 inhabitants in the previous census. All children within chosen communities who were aged 1 to 59 months weighing at least 3,800 g were eligible for treatment.</p>

      <sec id="sec014">
        <title>Randomization and masking</title>
        <p>In MORDOR I, 646 communities were randomized to azithromycin or placebo MDA. As prespecified, all communities were treated with azithromycin in year 3 because a statistically significant difference in mortality was found [<xref rid="pmed.1004386.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. These same communities were re-randomized in Phase III to azithromycin or placebo MDA, without regard to their previous randomization. In this study, 163 communities were randomly selected from MORDOR Phase III (blocked on Phase I assignment, but not on Phase III rerandomization). This randomization scheme reflected a conception of the Phase I comparison as being a central objective. Randomization was generated with the use of R software, version 3.5.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing; performed by TCP). While all communities received azithromycin during year 3, participants, field staff, and investigators remained unaware of the original treatment assignment during years 1 to 2 of MORDOR Phases I and III.</p>

        <title>Sample collection</title>
        <p>A sample of 40 children (age range 1 to 59 months) in each community was randomly selected for sample collection from the 54-month census. Rectal swabs were then obtained 6 months after the 9th MDA (60-month time point, end of Phase III). Samples were placed in Norgen stool collection kit (Norgen Biotek Corp, Ontario, Canada) to preserve nucleic acids. Samples were stored on ice in the field and at &#x2212;20&#xB0;C in Niger until shipment to UCSF for longer-term storage at &#x2212;80&#xB0;C until sample processing.</p>

        <title>DNA-sequencing and bioinformatics</title>
        <p>All 5,340 collected rectal samples were respectively pooled at the community level, with each pool representing an analog average load of that community. Four communities with less than 10 samples collected were excluded from sequencing [<xref rid="pmed.1004386.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Total DNA was extracted from 150 pooled rectal samples using the Norgen stool DNA isolation kit (Norgen Biotek Corp, Ontario, Canada) per manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions and prepared for DNA sequencing libraries using the New England Biolabs&#x2019; (NEB, Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States of America) NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit and then amplified with 10 PCR cycles and sequenced on the NovaSeq 6000 instrument (Illumina, San Diego, California, USA) using 150-nucleotide (nt) paired-end sequencing. Sequencing reads were analyzed for antibiotic resistance determinants as previously described [<xref rid="pmed.1004386.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Briefly, host reads were removed, and non-host reads were quality-filtered and aligned to the MEGARes reference antimicrobial database (version 2.0.0) using BWA with default settings [<xref rid="pmed.1004386.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004386.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Each identified antibiotic resistance determinant was grouped at the class level (such as macrolide, aminoglycosides, beta-lactams) using Resistome Analyzer (<ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/cdeanj/resistomeanalyzer" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/cdeanj/resistomeanalyzer</ext-link>) and normalized by the total number of non-host reads in the respective pooled sample. Macrolide resistance determinants belong to the macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin (MLS) class. Those resistance mechanisms include 23S rRNA methyltransferases, macrolide phosphotransferases, macrolide resistance efflux pumps, lincosamide nucleotidyltransferases, macrolide-resistance 23S rRNA mutation, macrolide esterases, steptogramin A O-acetyltransferease, macrolide glycosyltransferases, and steptrogramin B ester bond cleavage.</p>

        <title>Outcomes</title>
        <p>The prespecified primary outcome was the normalized macrolide resistance determinants in each of the 4 treatment groups. Prespecified secondary outcomes included resistance to beta-lactams and other antimicrobial classes.</p>

        <title>Trial oversight</title>
        <p>A Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) consisting of experts in biostatistics, trial design, ethics, epidemiology, and infectious disease oversaw the trial. The DSMC met annually during the course of the trial to review and approve the study design prior to the start of enrollment and to review any proposed changes to the study. Any serious adverse event determined to be possibly related to study participation was reported to the DSMC in real time and to the UCSF Committee for Human Research within 48 h.</p>

        <title>Sample size</title>
        <p>We estimated that 160 total communities would provide approximately 80% power to detect a 3.5-fold difference in any pairwise comparison (assuming <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.01, and an approximate SD of the log base 2 of the read count (plus 1) of 2.25). The SD of the log read count was derived from the placebo arm of the MORDOR 36-month data [<xref rid="pmed.1004386.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This detectable effect size (3.5-fold) was approximately half of what was observed in the MORDOR 36-month results [<xref rid="pmed.1004386.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p>

All randomized communities were included in the permutation testing, which was based on 100,000 replications. As a methodological sensitivity analysis, the Kruskal&#x2013;Wallis (nonparametric one-way ANOVA), comparing all 4 arms was used. No adjustments for other covariates were undertaken.</p>

          <title>Secondary outcomes</title>
          <p>For each other drug resistance category (e.g., beta-lactams, aminoglycosides), the community-level normalized read counts for the 4 study arms were compared pairwise using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Since this required 6 comparisons for each drug resistance category, we prespecified the use of the Westfall&#x2013;Young step-down min-P adjustment procedure for each category [<xref rid="pmed.1004386.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. We prespecified reporting of min-P findings for macrolide and beta-lactam resistance; all others are pooled and subject to false discovery rate (FDR) adjustment with prespecified FDR of 0.05. Additionally, we report findings contrasting recent administration of placebo (groups 3 and 4) with recent administration of azithromycin (groups 1 and 2) (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, unprespecified analysis). Fold changes were estimated by transforming normalized read counts using the transformation log(<italic toggle="yes">x</italic> + <italic toggle="yes">epsilon</italic>) where <italic toggle="yes">epsilon</italic> = 0.001 (qualitative results are not sensitive to choice of small <italic toggle="yes">epsilon</italic>) and performing analysis using the unadjusted confidence interval from the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Specifically, the Hodges&#x2013;Lehmann estimator was computed on the transformed scale, and the inverse transformation was used to yield an approximate ratio. Results were based on 100,000 independent permutations. As a methodological sensitivity analysis, we also conducted an overall Kruskal&#x2013;Wallis (nonparametric one-way ANOVA) for each drug resistance category. Calculations were conducted using the R statistics package (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria), v. 4.3.0 (package NRejections) [<xref rid="pmed.1004386.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p>

      <title>Results</title>
      <p>As shown in <xref rid="pmed.1004386.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>, 163 communities from Phase III were randomly selected for potential inclusion with the goal of having 160 communities agreeing to participate. At census, 9 communities refused sample collection, and 4 communities were excluded from sample processing and analysis because fewer than 10 samples were collected. A total of 150 communities remained and contributed to the analysis. Because of the prespecified study design for Phases I, II, and III, the communities fell into 1 of 4 treatment groups: (1) received 9 twice-yearly azithromycin treatments (<italic toggle="yes">N</italic> = 51); (2) received 4 twice-yearly placebo treatments followed by 5 twice-yearly azithromycin treatments (<italic toggle="yes">N</italic> = 40); (3) received 6 twice-yearly azithromycin treatments followed by 3 twice-yearly placebo treatments (<italic toggle="yes">N</italic> = 27); and (4) received 4 twice-yearly placebo, followed by 2 twice-yearly azithromycin, and then followed by 3 more twice-yearly placebo treatments (<italic toggle="yes">N</italic> = 32). The mean (&#xB1; SD) treatment coverage for the communities in group 1 was 94% (&#xB1;2%), 93% (&#xB1;3%) for group 2, 94% (&#xB1;3%) for group 3, and 93% (&#xB1;2%) for group 4.</p>

On average, there were 36 children (95% CI: 35 to 37) contributing samples from each community, and 48% (95% CI: 47% to 49%) of the children were females.

Macrolide resistance determinants in the gut were increased in communities recently receiving twice-yearly azithromycin treatments at the community-level (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">unadj</italic></sub> &lt; 0.001, groups 1 and 2 versus groups 3 and 4, fold change 2.18, 95% CI: 1.49 to 3.51; <xref rid="pmed.1004386.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>, <xref rid="pmed.1004386.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In particular, 4.5 years of azithromycin treatments (group 1) resulted in a 2.23-fold (95% CI: 1.20 to 5.17) increase in macrolide resistance determinants compared to 1 year of azithromycin treatment only during year 3 of the study (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">adj</italic></sub> = 0.01, Wilcoxon rank-sum (i.e., without covariate adjustment), min-P adjustment). Similarly, communities that did not get treatment during the first 2 years but received azithromycin treatments during the last 3 years of the study (MORDOR II and III) were found to have significantly more macrolide resistance determinants than communities that were randomized to placebo during the last 2 years (MORDOR III) (group 2 versus group 3, 2.14-fold, 95% CI: 1.38 to 3.64, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">adj</italic></sub> = 0.003; group 2 versus group 4, 3.12-fold, 95% CI: 1.78 to 7.31, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">adj</italic></sub> &lt; 0.001; Wilcoxon rank-sum, min-P adjustment), regardless of prior exposure to azithromycin during the first 2 years of the study (MORDOR I). Finally, we did not find a statistically significant difference in macrolide resistance determinants between 4.5 years of azithromycin treatment (group 1) compared to 2.5 years of treatment (group 2) (0.80-fold, 95% CI: 0.52 to 1.00, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">adj</italic></sub> = 0.19, Wilcoxon rank-sum, min-P adjustment) or 3 years of treatment (group 3) (1.60-fold, 95% CI: 1.00 to 3.08, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">adj</italic></sub> = 0.06, Wilcoxon rank-sum, min-P adjustment).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study, we found that azithromycin MDA for childhood mortality selects for macrolide resistance determinants in the gut of preschool children. Here, children in communities randomized to receive azithromycin in the last 1.5 years had more resistance determinants than those randomized to placebo. However, we were unable to find a difference between communities treated for 4.5 years versus just 2.5 years. Thus resistance in the gut may plateau after several MDAs, rather than continue to increase until it saturates the age-group [<xref rid="pmed.1004386.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Previous studies have suggested co-selection of resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics [<xref rid="pmed.1004386.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004386.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. We were unable to confirm this, although we see marginal evidence of an increase in aminoglycoside resistance determinants (as noted in methodological sensitivity analysis). Note that in statistical analysis of adverse outcomes such as resistance reported here, statistical conservatism may de-emphasize potentially important safety indicators. The results of this trial add to the growing body of evidence that supports regular antibiotic resistance surveillance in the setting of azithromycin MDA [<xref rid="pmed.1004386.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pmed.1004386.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p>
      <p>The short-term beneficial effects of azithromycin MDA for childhood mortality in sub-Saharan and West African countries are clear and may be comparable with other cost-effective interventions [<xref rid="pmed.1004386.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004386.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In MORDOR Phase I, childhood mortality was reduced by 18% in Niger after 2 years of twice-yearly azithromycin MDA [<xref rid="pmed.1004386.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. A similar reduction in childhood mortality was again seen in MORDOR Phase II, when the placebo-treated communities received a year of twice-yearly azithromycin MDA [<xref rid="pmed.1004386.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In Phase II, 1 year of twice-yearly MDA to communities that previously received placebo reduced childhood mortality by 13% in these communities [<xref rid="pmed.1004386.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Antimicrobial resistance monitoring in the morbidity communities showed that there was an increase in the prevalence of macrolide-resistant <italic toggle="yes">S</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">pneumoniae</italic> in the nasopharynx and a selection of macrolide resistance determinants in the gut of children after MORDOR Phase I [<xref rid="pmed.1004386.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004386.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. An additional year of MDA led to an unexpected detection of an increase in genetic resistance determinants for aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, metronidazole, and trimethoprim, suggesting co-selection in the morbidity communities (MORDOR Phase II) [<xref rid="pmed.1004386.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. These co-selection effects appeared less robust at the 4-year and 5-year time points, although it was unclear if spillovers through migration and social interactions were diluting the effects as essentially all communities surrounding the 15-placebo communities had received at least 1 year of twice-yearly azithromycin MDA by the 4th and 5th year time points [<xref rid="pmed.1004386.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004386.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p>
      <p>The long-term adverse effects due to the potential spread of antimicrobial resistance with prolonged azithromycin MDA do raise concern. Azithromycin has been distributed for trachoma control for 25 years. WHO treatment guidelines recommend treating entire trachoma-endemic communities annually, resulting in approximately 3 times as many doses as the biannual distributions to preschool children for childhood mortality. Macrolide resistance in trachoma communities returned to a low level soon after cessation of treatment [<xref rid="pmed.1004386.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004386.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004386.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004386.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Furthermore, the results of this study suggest that prior exposure (i.e., during the early MORDOR Phase I study randomization) did not appear to enhance macrolide resistance selection. The increase in macrolide resistance determinants was only detectable between communities that received azithromycin during the last 2 years (MORDOR Phase III) compared to those that received placebo during the last 2 years.</p>
      <p>From a surveillance standpoint for azithromycin MDA for either trachoma or childhood mortality, this current study is one of the largest trials attempting to comprehensively characterize antimicrobial resistance in a randomized controlled trial setting [<xref rid="pmed.1004386.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004386.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. While phenotypic analysis may improve the mechanistic understanding at the individual bacteria level or at the species level, the hurdles associated with sample handling in the field, maintaining cold-chains across Niger, and the sheer number of samples and communities involved make such an analysis more difficult. Also, phenotypic analysis typically only analyzes a small number of colonies, while genotypical analysis allows for the potential inclusion of all strains present.</p>
      <p>This study had several limitations. First, it lacks an arm where no treatment was provided across 5 years. This was because treatment was prespecified for all participating communities if MORDOR I found a beneficial effect of azithromycin MDA. Thus, all communities had at least 1 year of treatment. Second, as mentioned above, no phenotypic analysis was performed and thus mechanistic information is incomplete. Gut resistome analysis at the community-level allows for the comprehensive cataloging of the potential antimicrobial resistance reservoir. It does not distinguish between whether a single bacterium harbors multiple different antimicrobial resistance genes (either separately or on a single cassette) or if each person in the community carries a different antimicrobial resistance gene in an entirely different bacterial species. Further, because we used normalized read number of resistance determinants in the community, we were unable to differentiate a small number of reads (less relative abundance) in many children versus a large number of reads (high relative abundance) in a single child. These results, however, can guide future surveillance approaches, such as the combination of unbiased resistome surveillance in the gut, <italic toggle="yes">E</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">coli</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic> spp in stool, and targeted phenotypic surveillance of <italic toggle="yes">S</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">pneumoniae</italic> in the nasopharynx [<xref rid="pmed.1004386.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Third, the clinical importance of the normalized read number of resistance genetic determinants can itself be difficult to interpret. Future work may elucidate the relationship between genetic determinants and clinically relevant phenotypic resistance in this population. Fourth, randomization was only blocked at baseline, and thus resulted in an imbalance in the number of communities among the treatment groups and a potentially modest loss of power. Fifth, as values derived from a sub-study of a larger trial, the <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-values and confidence intervals reported in this study should not be interpreted as definitive treatment effects. Moreover, adjusting for familywise error rates increases <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-values in general, a desirable feature when analyzing exploratory hypotheses or treatment effects across many groups. However, when considering harmful effects in the context of many other analyses, such adjustments reduce our power to find such harmful effects for precisely this reason, an important consideration given that studies are often underpowered to detect rare adverse events. Thus, when considering harmful effects, we prefer to limit the use of such adjustments in the interest of a less statistically conservative or stringent (but more <italic toggle="yes">clinically</italic> conservative) inference. Finally, while large in scope, only Nigerien children were included and thus may limit generalizability in other sub-Saharan African settings where azithromycin MDA may also be used.</p>
      <p>In summary, in the Nigerien communities participating in the mortality study of MODROR, we found that azithromycin MDA directly led to a reduction in childhood mortality and an increase in macrolide antibiotic resistance. Longer duration of azithromycin distributions were not associated with increased resistance. Although co-selection of resistance to other classes of antibiotics is possible, these results were not definitive, and only even suggestive with aminoglycosides [<xref rid="pmed.1004386.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004386.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. While azithromycin MDA may not be a long-term solution for childhood mortality, it is currently a feasible and actionable approach to prevent unnecessary deaths in low-resource countries. Indeed, Niger has plans to implement treatment for the entire country and other sub-Saharan countries may follow. Its implementation, however, may need to be coupled with routine and broad surveillance of resistance. Future research should focus on the longer-term effects of azithromycin MDA, spillover effects where the non-target groups (older children and family members) may be at risk, and co-selection of resistance to antibiotics other than macrolides.</p>
