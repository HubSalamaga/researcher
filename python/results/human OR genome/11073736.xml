      <title>1 Introduction</title>
      <p>Traffic crashes are a significant public health concern worldwide, with over 1.5 million people losing their lives annually. This study introduces a novel approach by applying machine learning methods to analyze risk factors of crashes by age group and type of crash, providing new insights into traffic safety. In Saudi Arabia, road accidents are a leading cause of injury-related deaths, particularly in urban areas. While statistical models have traditionally been used to evaluate road accident severity, the advent of machine learning technologies offers a promising alternative. Machine learning techniques can understand complex, non-linear relationships between data elements, potentially improving accuracy and consistency in traffic safety analysis. However, there is a notable gap in research, especially in analyzing different driving hazards. This study aims to fill this gap by employing various supervised learning techniques to analyze a dataset of traffic incidents in the city, focusing on individual incidents and age categories. Advanced machine learning methods and comparative analysis set this study apart from previous research, with the potential to significantly impact traffic safety research and inform the creation of effective traffic safety regulations.</p>
      <p>Several decades have passed since statistical models were used to assess the severity of road accidents and traffic safety. On the other hand, technologies based on machine learning can potentially deliver an alternative revolution. It is acknowledged that machine learning approaches may be used to comprehend intricate, non-linear interactions between various data components [<xref rid="pone.0302171.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This has resulted in greater anticipated accuracy and consistency than traditional methods [<xref rid="pone.0302171.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Research fields are falling behind, particularly regarding research on various driving dangers [<xref rid="pone.0302171.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This is even though there have been numerous advancements in technological development. Such a large study gap highlights the need to do individualized research to identify the myriad of elements contributing to road accidents [<xref rid="pone.0302171.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0302171.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Motor vehicle accidents may be caused by various factors, which is why this is the case. The role of age in intensifying vehicular accident fatalities has been proven after a detailed review of appropriate resources. Serious traffic accidents involving young drivers frequently occur, mainly due to the lack of experience on their part [<xref rid="pone.0302171.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0302171.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, senior drivers have a greater chance of severe wreck involvement. These are associated with aging issues, for example, slow response to stimuli and limited senses. Similarly, it should be mentioned that male drivers are typically involved in severe accidents [<xref rid="pone.0302171.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0302171.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], thus underscoring the substantial impact of the phenomenon.</p>
      <p>Moreover, the qualities directly related to the accidents contribute significantly to the magnitude of such accidents [<xref rid="pone.0302171.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Among these factors are the speed at which the car was hit by the other vehicle, also known as the second automobile [<xref rid="pone.0302171.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], the number of cars involved in the incident [<xref rid="pone.0302171.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and the congestion level. Other external factors contributing to the seriousness of accidents include driving at night and unfavorable weather conditions. Other significant factors influencing traffic accident results include the nature of the road where the accident occurred and the collision structure. However, this knowledge is restricted due to the absence of extensive research studies comparing these different communities [<xref rid="pone.0302171.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p>
      <p>The demographic trends impacting road accident incidence have been thoroughly documented in high-income countries such as the United States and Sweden, thanks to the research conducted [<xref rid="pone.0302171.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Several pieces of empirical data demonstrate, time and time again, that certain demographic groups are disproportionately represented in accidents that result in catastrophic consequences [<xref rid="pone.0302171.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0302171.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. It is important to note that this category includes senior drivers who are 65 or older and younger male drivers older than 25. It is also concerning because this demographic trend raises fundamental issues about the suitability and effectiveness of the rules for driver education and road safety [<xref rid="pone.0302171.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0302171.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This is especially true concerning the complex needs of these vulnerable groups. Despite this, there is a disturbing lack of data and documentation in countries with lower and intermediate incomes, such as Saudi Arabia [<xref rid="pone.0302171.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0302171.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This is especially alarming considering the distinct road conditions and regulatory regimes distinctive to these places. At the same time, the specific circumstances of the accident are pretty important when examining traffic safety. Compared to rear-end accidents, other collisions, such as head-on collisions, side-impact collisions, and wrecks involving a single vehicle, are often associated with more severe results [<xref rid="pone.0302171.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0302171.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. On the other hand, the complicated hazards associated with every type of accident and how these dangers vary depending on the drivers&#x2019; demographics have not been examined to a considerable extent. Given the importance of creating more effective and targeted safety measures and interventions, which need a full awareness of the relationship between accident type and driver characteristics, this absence of information is considerable [<xref rid="pone.0302171.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0302171.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This is because the development of these measures and interventions is vital.</p>
      <p>A progressive progression has characterized the application of machine learning to studying traffic safety throughout its history. Using complex approaches such as gradient boosting [<xref rid="pone.0302171.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and decision trees tuned to mitigate class imbalance [<xref rid="pone.0302171.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], strict regression models have been shown to perform better than other models when it comes to forecasting the severity of failures [<xref rid="pone.0302171.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. One of the reasons why machine learning is powerful is that it can get into very complex forms of data in search of hidden information. Through this, various nuances, such as those ignored by the common-place analytical methods, are brought out. However, such elaborate analytical procedures are hardly used in any study. The lack of enough data restricts comprehensive assessments of various kinds of risk associated with drivers&#x2019; subsets at once in a single dataset set [<xref rid="pone.0302171.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0302171.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p>
      <p>In recent years, the proliferation of traffic-related fatalities has escalated into a global concern, underscoring the urgent need for comprehensive research in traffic safety. Despite considerable advancements in vehicle technology and road safety measures, a critical examination of existing literature reveals a notable gap: a scarcity of in-depth comparative analyses on the determinants of fatal crash risks, mainly differentiated by age groups and crash types, using sophisticated machine learning techniques. This oversight highlights a significant shortfall in our current understanding and approach to mitigating traffic fatalities. Therefore, this study is conceived to bridge this gap by employing advanced machine learning methodologies to dissect and compare the underlying risk factors contributing to fatal crashes across different age demographics and crash scenarios. By doing so, this research aims to provide a nuanced understanding of the complexities involved in traffic accidents, thereby offering targeted insights for developing more effective safety interventions. Such a contribution is pivotal for advancing traffic safety research and formulating policies that can significantly reduce the incidence of fatal traffic accidents.</p>

      <title>2 Related work</title>
      <p>The study of traffic crash severity and the application of machine learning techniques to enhance road safety have been subjects of considerable interest in recent research. Several studies have utilized various statistical and machine learning models to analyze factors influencing the severity of road accidents. For instance, Abdelwahab and Abdel-Aty (2001) employed logistic regression models to examine the impact of driver characteristics on crash severity, highlighting the significance of age, gender, and driving experience. Similarly, Chang and Chen (2005) used decision tree models to identify key factors contributing to severe injuries in traffic crashes, emphasizing the role of environmental and vehicle-related variables.</p>
      <p>Recent advancements in machine learning have led to the exploration of more sophisticated techniques in traffic safety research. Kunt and Yasar (2017) applied neural networks to predict the severity of road accidents, demonstrating the potential of these models to capture complex relationships between variables. Additionally, Li et al. (2019) employed support vector machines to classify accident severity, showcasing the effectiveness of this method in handling imbalanced datasets.</p>
      <p>Despite these advancements, there remains a gap in the literature concerning the comprehensive analysis of traffic crash risk factors across different age groups and incident types using machine learning methods. Most studies focus on specific aspects of traffic safety, such as driver behavior or environmental factors, without a holistic comparison of various risk factors. This study aims to bridge this gap by employing various supervised learning techniques to analyze a complete dataset of traffic incidents in Jeddah City. By comparing the risk factors associated with different age groups and types of incidents, this research seeks to provide a more nuanced understanding of traffic safety, contributing to the development of targeted intervention programs and customized safety measures.</p>

        <p>While this study provides valuable insights into the risk factors associated with fatal crashes, it is essential to note that our dataset was explicitly limited to deadly crashes. Property damage crashes were not considered in our analysis. This exclusion was deliberate, as our primary objective was to compare the risk factors associated with severe outcomes. However, this limitation means that our findings may not directly apply to crashes resulting in property damage but no fatalities. Future research should consider including property damage crashes in their analysis to perform a more in-depth examination of the crash outcomes and provide a comprehensive understanding of the factors contributing to fatal and non-fatal crashes.</p>

        <title>3.5 Rationale for exclusion of gender in analysis</title>
        <p>In the initial design of our study, as outlined in <xref rid="pone.0302171.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, gender was acknowledged as a significant factor in previous research concerning crash risk factors. However, upon further deliberation, it was decided to exclude gender from the primary analysis for this specific investigation. This decision was not made lightly and warrants clarification.</p>
        <p>Our research focuses predominantly on environmental and vehicular factors that influence crash risks. The decision to exclude gender from our analysis stems from a targeted approach that prioritizes these elements. The study aimed to isolate and examine the impact of these factors without the variability introduced by demographic variables. This approach aligns with our study&#x2019;s objectives, intending to provide a concentrated analysis of areas less explored in existing literature.</p>
        <p>It is crucial to acknowledge that excluding gender does not negate its importance in traffic safety research. Previous studies have demonstrated significant gender differences in crash involvement rates and risk-taking behaviors. Recognizing this, the study&#x2019;s scope was designed to complement, not replace, the comprehensive body of work that includes gender as a critical variable.</p>

        <title>3.6 Future research direction</title>
        <p>We advocate for future research focusing on the gender effects on crash risk factors. Such studies are imperative to fully understand crash risks&#x2019; multifaceted nature and develop targeted interventions. Our research lays the groundwork for these investigations by highlighting the need for a diverse approach encompassing demographic and non-demographic factors in traffic safety analysis.</p>

        <title>3.7 Data visualisation</title>
        <p>Advanced visualization techniques were used with Python&#x2019;s Matplotlib and Seaborn modules to ensure a clear and meaningful depiction of the data. The age distribution of drivers, as shown in <xref rid="pone.0302171.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>, is dominated by individuals in the 20&#x2013;50-year age range, according to the degree of injuries. The type of crashes is shown in <xref rid="pone.0302171.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>, with rear-end collisions being the most frequent. <xref rid="pone.0302171.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref> shows accidents by weather conditions. Using a correlation heatmap, <xref rid="pone.0302171.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref> illustrates positive connections between fatal risk factors such as higher speed limits and older driver age. These visualizations are essential to create the foundation for more feature engineering and analysis.</p>

      <title>5 Results</title>
      <p>The performance of all four constructed machine learning models&#x2014;LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost, and Random Forest&#x2014;on the typical 30% blind test set is compared in this portion of the paper. In addition, SHAP values and feature significance studies are used to ascertain the primary risk variables that significantly contribute to fatal collisions.</p>
      <p>The LightGBM classifier achieved the most remarkable test accuracy of 94.9%, with XGBoost coming in a close second with a test accuracy of 95.4%. In comparison to decision trees that are used on their own, boosting-based models have been shown to have a much higher capacity for prediction. All models could match the training data correctly, achieving one hundred percent scores for accuracy, precision, and recall, suggesting no underfitting. LightGBM, on the other hand, displayed the best generalization with almost no insignificant overfitting. A score of 0.949 on the F1 test indicates a substantial equilibrium between the accuracy and recall measures. The confusion matrices that visually validate this trend are provided. These figures cover all four models. Methods that boost results in a reduction in the total number of misclassifications.</p>
      <p>It is possible to credit LightGBM&#x2019;s persistent domination to its sophisticated approaches, including leaf-wise tree growth, histogram-based data binning, and gradient-based one-side sampling, all resulting in quicker and more accurate ensembles. Regarding delivering competitive performance, XGBoost uses weighted quantile sketching to provide approximate tree splitting, while CatBoost uses ordered boosting and categorical optimization. However, it is understandable that the non-ensemble Random Forest model deviates in terms of its predictive power.</p>

It achieved a test accuracy of 94.9% during the testing process, indicating that it accurately identified both fatal and non-fatal collisions. This suggests that there is a balanced trade-off between precision (95%) and recall (94.9%), as shown by the test F1 score of 0.949 [<xref rid="pone.0302171.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].

        <title>5.6 Features importance analysis</title>
        <p>LightBGM Classifiers with the city&#x2019;s Crash Data have provided insights into crash circumstances. These classifiers could distinguish acute and chronic complications and motor-based and other injuries. Weather conditions (17.8%), time of the day (13.1%), and speed-related parameters (12.5%) are factors that can influence fatality predictions. An excellent technique for interpreting complex machine learning models is offered by the LightGBM connected to SHAP analysis. This approach stresses the impact of time of the day, weather conditions, and speeding factors on the severity of crashes.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, an assessment of road surface characteristics and a comparison between fatal and non-fatal accidents will be conducted. To identify the effect of different factors on a fatal compared to a nonfatal outcome, SHAP value plots are used for non-fatal outcomes in a collision severity study. This proves the importance of road surface, climatic conditions, and driving attitudes, including Overspeeding. To achieve the Vision 2030 goals on road safety, there is a need for strict enforcement of traffic rules, proper maintenance of good roads, and reduced speed. However, this report highlighted the importance of features and what made Shap&#x2019;s study possible for every attribute impacting the model prediction. To get a good idea of these links, the following charts (<xref rid="pone.0302171.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10</xref>) describe the complicated links between different factors affecting the model prediction.</p>

      <title>6 Discussion</title>
      <sec id="sec030">
        <title>6.1 Analyzing predictive features</title>
        <p>Our machine learning algorithms identified several critical characteristics highly predictive of the likelihood of fatal collisions. The most relevant factors were the driver&#x2019;s age and gender, weather conditions, time of day, speed-related variables, and road conditions. These findings are consistent with theoretical understandings of how driving behavior and various circumstances affect accident severity. For example, younger male drivers tend to engage in riskier driving habits, and reduced visibility during adverse weather conditions leads to slower response times. Similarly, high driving speeds also impact vehicular control.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec031">
        <title>6.2 Practical implications</title>
        <p>Speeding characteristics have a considerable predictive effect, necessitating targeted speed enforcement and traffic calming measures. Installing speed cameras, modifying speed limits according to road construction, and imposing stricter fines for speed limit violations are potential solutions to address this widespread risk factor. Additionally, the dangers associated with younger male drivers highlight deficiencies in graduated driver licensing systems and underscore the need for defensive driving education campaigns targeting high-risk demographic groups. Given the potential impact of adverse weather conditions, transportation authorities may consider increasing the use of variable speed limit systems or advisory alerts triggered by unfavorable conditions.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec032">
        <title>6.3 Comparison with past literature</title>
        <p>Our research lends credence to previously held beliefs on the primary factors determining collision severity. Previous studies at a macro level have consistently found characteristics such as speeding, driver age, gender, and adverse weather as significant risk factors in both developed and developing nation settings. Our findings provide further evidence that human behavior, infrastructure design, and environmental factors all play an essential part in determining the outcomes of various collisions. Incorporating new predictive variables, such as the time of day, enhances explanatory power and reveals other situational elements influencing collision likelihood. Our micro-level research of an understudied setting provides additional detail on localized accident trends.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec033">
        <title>6.4 Methodological reflections</title>
        <p>The use of ensemble machine learning approaches such as XGBoost, which offer predictive advantages over traditional statistical models due to their ability to capture complex interacting effects, was a significant strength of this work. However, the model inputs were limited, as police reports were the sole data source. Incorporating hospital trauma records could provide a deeper understanding of injury patterns and accident consequences. More comprehensive traffic volume measurements could also help isolate exposure concerns across various scenarios. Deep learning approaches might further assist models in inferring non-linear predictive relationships within such multidimensional data.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec034">
        <title>6.5 Limitations and future research</title>
        <p>While providing valuable insights into traffic crash risk factors in the city, this study has limitations. Firstly, the dataset used in this research was limited to recorded traffic incidents by the Traffic Police Department, which may not capture all relevant variables or the extent of traffic crashes in the area. Additionally, the reliance on police reports may introduce bias, as not all incidents are reported or recorded accurately.</p>
        <p>Methodologically, the study employed machine learning techniques that, while effective, may not fully account for the complexity of traffic safety dynamics. The models used depend on the quality and completeness of the input data, and the results may vary with different datasets or contexts.</p>
        <p>The applicability of the study&#x2019;s findings is primarily limited to the urban setting of the city. The risk factors identified and the model&#x2019;s predictions may not be directly transferable to other regions or countries with different traffic conditions, cultural factors, or road safety policies.</p>
        <p>Future research should address these limitations by expanding the dataset to include a broader range of variables and incidents. Incorporating data from other sources, such as hospital records or traffic surveillance systems, could provide a more comprehensive understanding of crash severity and its determinants. Exploring other machine learning techniques or deep learning models may offer further insights into the complex interactions between risk factors.</p>
        <p>Further studies could also focus on the generalizability of the findings, testing the models in different geographical settings or applying the methodology to other types of traffic safety issues. Developing more tailored intervention strategies based on the specific risk factors identified in this study could significantly contribute to reducing traffic-related injuries and fatalities, both in Saudi Arabia and globally.</p>

        <title>6.6 Broader societal impacts</title>
        <p>Our models map out potential avenues for targeted safety interventions that contribute to achieving Saudi Vision 2030 quality-of-life goals. These initiatives aim to reduce the hazards among younger drivers and other categories. Realizing further prediction improvements via data integration might put Saudi transportation authorities in a better position to undertake risk-proportionate countermeasures, optimize resource allocation, and achieve sustained reductions in traffic casualties. In a broader sense, predictive analytics provide options not before recognized for evidence-driven traffic safety planning in emerging nations that are fast becoming more motorized.</p>
