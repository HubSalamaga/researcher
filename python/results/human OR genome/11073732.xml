      <title>Introduction</title>
      <sec id="sec005">
        <title>Rationale</title>
        <p>Researchers, practitioners, and the general public have continued to exhibit growing interest in the Science of Learning, &#x201C;the scientific study of the underlying bases of learning with the goal of describing, understanding, or improving learning across developmental stages and diverse contexts&#x201D; [<xref rid="pone.0301935.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Recent advances in the cognitive and neural sciences have illuminated our understanding of the principles, processes, and mechanisms of learning across a diverse range of species, including our own [e.g., <xref rid="pone.0301935.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Findings from these studies support the conclusion that learning is a complex lifelong process involving the interplay of cognitive, neural, and other factors [e.g., <xref rid="pone.0301935.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Furthermore, the experience of learning modifies underlying cognitive processes and brain structure and function in a manner that impacts on future cognition and behavior [<xref rid="pone.0301935.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Given the relevance of this work outside the research laboratory, there has been growing interest in the application of findings from the Science of Learning to a number of other fields, including education [e.g., <xref rid="pone.0301935.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0301935.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p>
        <p>While there is tremendous interest in understanding human learning, previous investigations have generally not been developmentally comprehensive in their focus. Existing studies on the Science of Learning have predominantly investigated samples drawn from developmental stages during early and late life [<xref rid="pone.0301935.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], although some notable exceptions do exist [e.g., <xref rid="pone.0301935.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This same pattern can be observed across published reviews with most focusing on research in samples of younger children [e.g., <xref rid="pone.0301935.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], or older adults, including clinical populations diagnosed with neurodegenerative diseases [<xref rid="pone.0301935.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Collectively, this has created a gap in our understanding of learning during healthy adulthood as well as effective ways in which that learning can be improved. Given that the human brain retains the capacity for plasticity across the adult lifespan [<xref rid="pone.0301935.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and that adult learning trajectories can be altered based on the influence of both internal and external factors [<xref rid="pone.0301935.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], there is significant value in better understanding learning during this period of development in the interests of maximizing human potential.</p>
        <p>Developing a more comprehensive understanding of learning during adulthood, and effective ways of improving that learning, are crucial goals given current global demographic trends. Many nations around the world are continuing to struggle in addressing the significant consequences of a rapidly aging population [<xref rid="pone.0301935.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This issue is further complicated by the dynamic nature of the modern workforce where regular career changes are becoming the norm [<xref rid="pone.0301935.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Consequently, governments have recently shifted attention and resources toward extending and translating findings from the Science of Learning in order to inform educational policy and intervention strategies. One of the overarching goals of this shift is to support the development of a citizenry that is both productive and agile into late adulthood. Presently, the absence of a comprehensive understanding of learning across adulthood in healthy populations places a significant hurdle on the path to accomplishing this goal. The conduct of an exhaustive review synthesizing existing research on the cognitive and neural mechanisms of learning and interventions to improve learning in healthy adults would contribute significantly to the accomplishment of this goal, with the additional benefit of identifying areas in need of further research.</p>

        <title>Objectives</title>
        <p>The main objective of the proposed systematic review is to identify and synthesize all recent cognitive and brain research investigating learning across the adult lifespan. This review will provide an overview of the principles, processes, and mechanisms of learning in healthy adults. Additionally, this review aims to synthesize all recent findings on interventions to improve learning in adults. Findings from the proposed review will have implications for our understanding of learning in adulthood, the scoping of funding calls for future Science of Learning research, and for public education and outreach efforts to support lifelong learning.</p>

Strings for each database will contain a combination of terms aimed at identifying all potentially relevant articles including &#x201C;learning&#x201D; and &#x201C;adult&#x201D;, as well terms related to different measures of interest including &#x201C;memory&#x201D;, &#x201C;intelligence&#x201D;, &#x201C;brain&#x201D;, and &#x201C;executive function&#x201D;.

In the event multiple files are exported from a single database due to export limits, citations will be combined into a single RIS file for each database. Files will be imported into Covidence. Covidence was selected due to a range of features that streamline the review process including deduplication of uploaded citations, collaborative screening, selection, and extraction, and automatic generation of PRISMA flowcharts [<xref rid="pone.0301935.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. We also selected Covidence because of its security features. Covidence employs encryption techniques to secure data transmission and storage, and ensures secure user authentication to prevent unauthorized access. In addition, Covidence implements role-based access control which allows the principal investigator to assign different levels of access and permissions to users based on their role within the review team. The cloud-based platform maintains regular data backups to mitigate data loss, adhering to relevant data protection regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to provide user privacy and ensure compliance with legal requirements.</p>

Screening will initially occur at the title and abstract level for articles. Next, full text versions of all candidate articles will be retrieved from the Internet, institutional libraries, or corresponding authors. Retrieved studies will then undergo full text screening, applying our inclusion and exclusion criteria. During title/abstract and full text screening, agreement between two independent reviewers will be required in order for a document to be included in the review. If two reviewers disagree about the inclusion of a document, the third reviewer will settle the conflict. In the event a preprint was later published as a journal article, only the journal article will be included.

        <title>Outcomes and prioritization</title>
        <p>The primary outcomes of the proposed review are measures of the relationship between cognition or brain structure/function and age (RQ1 &amp; RQ2), and learning difference scores or qualitative descriptions from comparisons between control and experimental groups or pre- and post-intervention timepoints (RQ3). Cognitive measures can include reaction time or accuracy rates from behavioral tasks (e.g., Simon task, n-back task), scores from cognitive assessments (e.g., intelligence test score), or self-reported measures (e.g., Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function for Adults). Brain measures can include data from any neuroanatomical or neurophysiological instrument related to structure (e.g., magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) or function (e.g., electroencephalogram [EEG]). Measures of age can include those that are quantified (e.g., age in years) as well as categorical labels (e.g., young adults and elders). Measures of learning can either be objectively measured (e.g., performance on a memory task, motor skill performance) or self-reported (e.g., GPA, educational attainment). For RQ3, the impact of an intervention can be represented as either a quantitative measurement or qualitative assessment of change in reported learning-related outcome.</p>

        <title>Risk of bias in individual studies</title>

Every included study will receive a rating of "Yes," "No," "Unclear," or "NA" for each criterion assessed. A team of three trained reviewers will conduct this assessment, and inter-reviewer reliability will be calculated across 20% of the included studies. No studies will be excluded from the planned review based on the results of the risk of bias assessment.</p>

        <title>Data synthesis</title>
        <p>Regarding RQ3, if there are at least two studies that report the impact of a specific intervention on learning, we will conduct a quantitative synthesis. Analyses will be performed in jamovi [<xref rid="pone.0301935.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Each type of intervention will undergo separate analysis. Either Hedge&#x2019;s <italic toggle="yes">g</italic> or Fisher&#x2019;s <italic toggle="yes">r</italic>-to-<italic toggle="yes">z</italic> transformed correlation coefficient will be used as the outcome measure depending on the outcome reported in a given study. To model the data, we will utilize a random-effects model and will estimate heterogeneity (i.e., tau<sup>2</sup>) using the restricted maximum-likelihood estimator [<xref rid="pone.0301935.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Additionally, heterogeneity will be reported as the I<sup>2</sup> statistic [<xref rid="pone.0301935.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. We will also assess the presence of outliers or influential data points using studentized residuals and Cook&#x2019;s distances. For each model, we will generate forest plots, which will include the pooled effect size. However, if the data reported across the included intervention studies exhibit significant heterogeneity that prevents a quantitative synthesis, we will assess the effectiveness of interventions using effect direction analysis [<xref rid="pone.0301935.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0301935.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].

      <title>Limitations</title>
      <p>The proposed systematic review&#x2019;s contributions are potentially limited by the exclusion of resources written in languages other than English. As a result, developments in the Science of Learning from parts of the world where English proficiency is lower will likely be missed. Additionally, because the proposed review will only focus on research in healthy adult samples, findings are likely not generalizable to adults living with psychiatric or neurological conditions that may impact on learning. Finally, given the diverse number of ways in which learning can be operationalized, heterogeneity across studies may prevent strong, broadly-focused conclusions from being drawn regarding changes in learning across the healthy adult lifespan.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>Findings from the proposed systematic review will contribute to our developing understanding of the complex nature of learning in healthy adult populations. Synthesizing an overview of key findings from this area of investigation will effectively map out what is currently known, supporting policy makers and funding agencies in the identification of research gaps that could be bridged by further use-inspired basic and applied research. Identification of these gaps can inform the scope of future funding priorities in the Science of Learning. Finally, this work will aid in the identification of relevant findings for translation outside of the research laboratory, as well as efficacious programs ready for development and scaling.</p>

      <p>2. Thank you for stating the following financial disclosure:&#xA0;</p>
      <p>&#xA0;[This project is funded by the Singapore Ministry of Education (#MOE-SOL-2023T001)].&#xA0;&#xA0;</p>
      <p>Please state what role the funders took in the study.&#xA0; If the funders had no role, please state: ""The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.""&#xA0;</p>
      <p>If this statement is not correct you must amend it as needed.&#xA0;</p>
      <p>Please respond by return e-mail so that we can amend your financial disclosure and competing interests on your behalf.</p>
      <p>3. When completing the data availability statement of the submission form, you indicated that you will make your data available on acceptance. We strongly recommend all authors decide on a data sharing plan before acceptance, as the process can be lengthy and hold up publication timelines. Please note that, though access restrictions are acceptable now, your entire data will need to be made freely accessible if your manuscript is accepted for publication. This policy applies to all data except where public deposition would breach compliance with the protocol approved by your research ethics board. If you are unable to adhere to our open data policy, please kindly revise your statement to explain your reasoning and we will seek the editor's input on an exemption. Please be assured that, once you have provided your new statement, the assessment of your exemption will not hold up the peer review process.</p>
      <p>4. Please include captions for your Supporting Information files at the end of your manuscript, and update any in-text citations to match accordingly. Please see our Supporting Information guidelines for more information: <ext-link xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/supporting-information" ext-link-type="uri">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/supporting-information</ext-link>.</p>
      <p>5. Please review your reference list to ensure that it is complete and correct. If you have cited papers that have been retracted, please include the rationale for doing so in the manuscript text, or remove these references and replace them with relevant current references.

<!-- <font color="black"> -->
<bold>Comments to the Author</bold>
</p>
      <p>1. Does the manuscript provide a valid rationale for the proposed study, with clearly identified and justified research questions?</p>
      <p>The research question outlined is expected to address a valid academic problem or topic and contribute to the base of knowledge in the field.<!-- </font> --></p>
      <p>Reviewer #1:&#xA0;Yes</p>
      <p>**********&#xA0;</p>
      <p><!-- <font color="black"> -->2. Is the protocol technically sound and planned in a manner that will lead to a meaningful outcome and allow testing the stated hypotheses?</p>
      <p>The manuscript should describe the methods in sufficient detail to prevent undisclosed flexibility in the experimental procedure or analysis pipeline, including sufficient outcome-neutral conditions (e.g. necessary controls, absence of floor or ceiling effects) to test the proposed hypotheses and a statistical power analysis where applicable. As there may be aspects of the methodology and analysis which can only be refined once the work is undertaken, authors should outline potential assumptions and explicitly describe what aspects of the proposed analyses, if any, are exploratory.<!-- </font> --></p>
      <p>Reviewer #1:&#xA0;Yes</p>
      <p>**********&#xA0;</p>
      <p><!-- <font color="black"> -->3. Is the methodology feasible and described in sufficient detail to allow the work to be replicable?</p>
      <p>Descriptions of methods and materials in the protocol should be reported in sufficient detail for another researcher to reproduce all experiments and analyses. The protocol should describe the appropriate controls, sample size calculations, and replication needed to ensure that the data are robust and reproducible.<!-- </font> --></p>
      <p>Reviewer #1:&#xA0;Yes</p>
      <p>**********&#xA0;</p>
      <p><!-- <font color="black"> -->4. Have the authors described where all data underlying the findings will be made available when the study is complete?</p>
      <p>The <ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/materials-and-software-sharing" ext-link-type="uri">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception, at the time of publication. The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data&#x2014;e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party&#x2014;those must be specified.<!-- </font> --></p>
      <p>Reviewer #1:&#xA0;Yes</p>
      <p>**********&#xA0;</p>
      <p><!-- <font color="black"> -->5. Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English?</p>
      <p>PLOS ONE does not copyedit accepted manuscripts, so the language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous. Any typographical or grammatical errors should be corrected at revision, so please note any specific errors here.<!-- </font> --></p>

      <p>Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above and, if applicable, provide comments about issues authors must address before this protocol can be accepted for publication. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about research or publication ethics.</p>
      <p>You may also provide optional suggestions and comments to authors that they might find helpful in planning their study.</p>

      <p>Reviewer #1:&#xA0;The manuscript meticulously presents a protocol for a systematic review, pinpointing a significant knowledge gap in adult learning. It adeptly outlines the study's importance and proposes well-structured questions on learning-related changes, focusing on cognitive and brain changes. However, the question regarding intervention lacks concrete sub-questions compared to the detailed queries of RQ1 &amp; 2. Suggesting a detailed question to investigate the precise cognitive and brain alterations induced by interventions could enhance the linkage to identified learning-related mechanisms, offering clearer guidance for the study's intervention part.</p>
