      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Barrett&#x2019;s esophagus (BE) is considered a precancerous condition that can lead to esophageal cancer (EC). According to a large population-based study, the relative risk of adenocarcinoma was 11 times higher among patients with BE than in the general population [<xref rid="pone.0302204.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Therefore, it is important to identify optimal interventions that promote regression of BE metaplasia and prevent progression to dysplasia and EC. However, current practices for managing BE vary across the world due to several existing national guidelines [<xref rid="pone.0302204.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0302204.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Successful ablation of BE is an attractive concept, and there has been considerable enthusiasm for related techniques. Although there are many treatment options for BE, such as drug control, endoscopic surveillance, argon plasma coagulation (APC), photodynamic therapy (PDT), radiofrequency ablation (RFA), endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR), and endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), there is currently no clear international consensus on their ranking in terms of curative effects.</p>
      <p>Network meta-analysis (NWM) is an evidence synthesis tool that compares randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with multiple treatments [<xref rid="pone.0302204.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0302204.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. NWM incorporates both direct and indirect evidence from a collection of RCTs, providing information on the relative effects of three or more therapeutic interventions competing for the same result.</p>

        <title>Identification of studies and data extraction</title>
        <p>In this NWM, we followed a systematic process that included four steps: identification, screening, eligibility, and inclusion. We searched the PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science databases up to March 2023 to identify human studies published in English using the following search terms and/or Medical Subject Headings: (&#x201C;Barrett Esophagus&#x201D; OR &#x201C;Barrett Metaplasia&#x201D; OR &#x201C;Barrett Metaplasias&#x201D; OR &#x201C;Metaplasia, Barrett&#x201D; OR &#x201C;Metaplasias, Barrett&#x201D; OR &#x201C;Barrett&#x2019;s Syndrome&#x201D; OR &#x201C;Barretts Syndrome&#x201D; OR &#x201C;Barrett Syndrome&#x201D; OR &#x201C;Barrett&#x2019;s Esophagus&#x201D; OR &#x201C;Barretts Esophagus&#x201D; OR &#x201C;Esophagus, Barrett&#x2019;s&#x201D; OR &#x201C;Esophagus, Barrett&#x201D; OR &#x201C;Barrett Epithelium&#x201D; OR &#x201C;Epithelium, Barrett&#x201D;) AND (treatment OR therapy OR therapeutics) AND (&#x201C;Randomized Controlled Trial&#x201D; OR &#x201C;Clinical Trials, Randomized&#x201D; OR &#x201C;Trials, Randomized Clinical&#x201D; OR &#x201C;Controlled Clinical Trials, Randomized&#x201D; OR &#x201C;RCTs&#x201D;). Additionally, we conducted a manual search of all review articles, published editorials, and original studies retrieved. Two authors independently extracted data from each study, and any disagreements were resolved through discussion with a third author until consensus was reached. We performed this NWM according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension statement for interventions [<xref rid="pone.0302204.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and the quality of evidence derived from pairwise and NWM was evaluated using the GRADE(Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) working group modality. Furthermore, we appraised the confidence in estimates derived from NWM.</p>

        <title>Study selection</title>
        <p>Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) treating Barrett esophagus were included in this study. Since there are many different techniques and treatment regimens used for Barrett esophagus, the authors grouped all treatments into 10 major groups based on the selected studies, which are shown in <xref rid="pone.0302204.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. To ensure the quality of the included RCTs, we excluded studies with small sample sizes below 20. In addition to this criterion, the studies had to contain at least one of the following three outcomes: complete ablation of BE, neoplastic progression of BE, or complete eradication of dysplasia. Complete ablation of BE is defined as the transformation from Barrett&#x2019;s esophagus to normal esophageal squamous epithelium during endoscopic re-examination. Neoplastic progression of BE was defined as progression of any of the following dysplasia severities: low-grade dysplasia, high-grade dysplasia, or esophageal cancer.</p>

        <title>Risk of bias of individual studies</title>
        <p>To assess the risk of bias (ROB), the two authors used the Cochrane Handbook version 5.1.0 tool [<xref rid="pone.0302204.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] for RCTs. They evaluated seven domains, including randomized sequence generation, treatment allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting, and other sources of bias. Studies with four or more high-risk domains were considered to have an overall high risk of bias. Meta-regression was conducted to examine the influence of risk of bias.</p>

      <sec id="sec011">
        <title>Statistical analysis</title>
        <p>For each pairwise comparison and outcome, RRs with 95% CI were obtained as a measure of the association between interventions. Conventional meta-analyses were conducted using fixed- and random-effects models, with inverse variance for each outcome and comparison. The standard chi<sup>2</sup> test was used at a significance level of 0.1. Heterogeneity was considered significant when I<sup>2</sup> value exceeded 50%. Inconsistency was also evaluated since it is crucial in NWMs [<xref rid="pone.0302204.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. We constructed comparison-adjusted funnel plots and checked for symmetry to evaluate whether studies with smaller sample sizes among those included in the article influenced efficacy results. Effect modifiers were evaluated using meta-regression. Surface under cumulative ranking (SUCRA) values were used in rankograms for the intervention network, examining the cumulative rank probability for each intervention&#x2019;s efficacy compared to an ideal intervention that showed the best efficacy without doubt. SUCRA&#x2009; = &#x2009;1 or 100% indicated the best efficacy achieved as a percentage [<xref rid="pone.0302204.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0302204.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0302204.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Data were processed using Bayesian NMA software, i.e., Stata 16.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). A p-value&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05 was significant for all tests, except for heterogeneity where the respective value was 0.1.</p>

        <p>The literature search identified 1291 studies, from which 307 duplicates were removed. After screening and full-text review, 23 studies with a total of 1675 participants were included (<xref rid="pone.0302204.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) [<xref rid="pone.0302204.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0302204.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].

As the meta-regression showed that excluding high-risk studies did not have a significant impact on the final results, we included all studies in the final analysis.</p>

The node size reflects the number of patients allocated to each treatment, while edge thickness is proportional to precision, i.e., the inverse of variance for each direct comparison. Four direct comparisons were possible for complete ablation of non-dysplastic BE(NDBE), six for complete ablation of BE with low-grade dysplasia (LGD) or high-grade dysplasia (HGD) or esophageal cancer (EC), 11 for neoplastic progression, and six for complete eradication of dysplasia. Meta-regression was performed using the aforementioned effect modifiers as a covariate, and the deviance information criterion (DIC) was compared to the model. The difference was less than one and therefore insignificant, so no covariates were used in the analysis.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The treatment of BE remains a controversial topic, particularly for BE with different degrees of metaplasia. In recent years, the focus of BE management has shifted towards complete ablation of BE, prevention of neoplastic progression, and complete eradication of dysplasia. Currently, there is an urgent need for high-quality research comparing different treatment options for BE. Network meta-analysis is a novel analytical method that can compare multiple interventions simultaneously, providing a larger statistical basis. In this manuscript, we have included almost all commonly used treatment methods and examined their effectiveness in complete ablation of BE, prevention of neoplastic progression, and complete eradication of dysplasia. To our knowledge, this is the first Bayesian network meta-analysis comparing all treatment options for curing BE.</p>
      <p>Our findings indicate that APC (SUCRA 84.3%) is the best regimen and performs significantly better than Surveillance and PPI/H2RA in terms of complete ablation of non-dysplastic BE, which is clinically significant. Recently, a novel hybrid ablation method known as hybrid APC has emerged, building upon APC. It has been reported that hybrid APC boasts a lower complication rate compared to traditional APC [<xref rid="pone.0302204.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Furthermore, its safety and effectiveness have been further affirmed in recent prospective studies [<xref rid="pone.0302204.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0302204.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. MPEC (SUCRA 67.5%) has also shown excellent efficacy, which is a technique used in endoscopy mainly for the treatment of gastrointestinal bleeding. Studies have shown that it can be an effective method for treating dysplasia and early-stage cancer in patients with Barrett&#x2019;s esophagus, offering a less invasive alternative to surgery [<xref rid="pone.0302204.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. This procedure involves using a special device with multiple electrodes to deliver controlled and targeted heat to the abnormal esophageal tissue, with the goal of destroying the abnormal cells and allowing healthy cells to regenerate. Several European and American guidelines recommend long-term endoscopic surveillance for non-dysplastic BE patients every 3&#x2013;5 years [<xref rid="pone.0302204.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0302204.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. It is believed that the progression from Barrett&#x2019;s esophagus to adenocarcinoma occurs through low-grade and high-grade dysplasia. It has been suggested that non-dysplastic BE patients have a low risk of developing carcinoma, and thus it is inappropriate to treat them [<xref rid="pone.0302204.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0302204.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Nevertheless, SHARMA P and her colleagues have found that a subset of patients with intestinal metaplasia may rapidly advance to invasive carcinoma without exhibiting the traditionally observed progression through dysplasia [<xref rid="pone.0302204.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Therefore, an intervention that may reduce this risk should be considered for all patients, consistent with our NMA results. Additionally, although controlling esophageal pH by PPIs may be associated with regression of BE, control of pH alone may not be sufficient to cause significant regression [<xref rid="pone.0302204.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0302204.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p>
      <p>Regarding complete ablation of BE with low-grade dysplasia or high-grade dysplasia or esophageal cancer, we found that PDT is the best regimen (SUCRA value 94.1%), with a significantly higher SUCRA value compared to RFA (74.4%), APC (64.5%), PPI/H2RA (52.3%), Surveillance (31.1%), SHAM/PBO (16.7%), and NSAIDs (16.1%). According to European guidelines [<xref rid="pone.0302204.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], endoscopic intervention is recommended for BE with low-grade dysplasia, high-grade dysplasia, or esophageal cancer, which aligns with our findings. The notable distinction, however, lies in the exceptional efficacy demonstrated by PDT in our study. In addition, in the analysis of complete eradication of dysplasia, SUCRA plots also showed a trend in ranking PDT highest (SUCRA value 91.2%). PDT is often combined with other treatments, such as endoscopic mucosal resection. In a five-year multicenter study, Overholt et al. confirmed the efficacy and safety of PDT for BE with HGD, which can produce long-term ablation of HGD and reduce the potential impact of cancer [<xref rid="pone.0302204.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. According to several studies [<xref rid="pone.0302204.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0302204.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], PDT has an ablation rate between 60% to 80%. Furthermore, multiple outcome studies have shown that PDT is more cost-effective than surgery and surveillance [<xref rid="pone.0302204.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0302204.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].</p>
      <p>For neoplastic progression, RFA (SUCRA value 26.0%) and SURGERY (SUCRA value 17.7%) perform significantly better than Surveillance. Recent guidelines recommend RFA for the eradication of remaining Barrett&#x2019;s epithelium after endoscopic resection of visible abnormalities containing any degree of dysplasia or neoplasia [<xref rid="pone.0302204.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. A recent meta-analysis by Wang Y et al. revealed that, compared with endoscopic surveillance, RFA decreased the risk of BE-LGD progression to BE-HGD or EAC by up to 75% [<xref rid="pone.0302204.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Fundoplication aims to reduce gastroesophageal reflux disease, which is the greatest modifiable risk factor in the metaplasia-EAC sequence [<xref rid="pone.0302204.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Compared with anti-reflux medication, a recent study suggests that fundoplication may be superior in preventing histopathological progression of BE to EAC [<xref rid="pone.0302204.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>].</p>
      <p>The Cochrane Handbook version 5.1.0 tool for assessing ROB in RCTs has been followed in making this manuscript to ensure high quality. All researchers&#x2019; evaluations of this study gave a high confidence result. However, caution must still be taken when interpreting the results as six studies had a high overall risk of bias. Although the sensitivity analysis did not indicate any issues, it might give an imprecise results since some outcomes were only represented by a few studies. Another limitation of this study cannot be ignored is the heterogeneity between the studies. While heterogeneity in the participant population itself is considered low, differences in the diagnostic criteria of BE in Japan and Western countries were not included in this NMA due to the lack of RCTs from Japan.</p>
      <p>Overall, endoscopic surveillance alone or PPI/H2RA alone may not be sufficient in managing BE, even in non-dysplastic BE. APC had excellent efficacy in treating non-dysplastic BE. For BE with low-grade dysplasia or high-grade dysplasia or esophageal cancer, PDT may be the optimal intervention as it incites regression of BE metaplasia and prevents future progression of BE to dysplasia and EC.</p>

      <p>Dear Dr. Pan,</p>
      <p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE&#x2019;s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p>
      <p>Please submit your revised manuscript by Feb 09 2024 11:59PM. If you will need more time than this to complete your revisions, please reply to this message or contact the journal office at&#xA0;<email>plosone@plos.org</email>. When you're ready to submit your revision, log on to <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/</ext-link> and select the 'Submissions Needing Revision' folder to locate your manuscript file.</p>
      <p>Please include the following items when submitting your revised manuscript:<!-- </div> --><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>A rebuttal letter that responds to each point raised by the academic editor and reviewer(s). You should upload this letter as a separate file labeled 'Response to Reviewers'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A marked-up copy of your manuscript that highlights changes made to the original version. You should upload this as a separate file labeled 'Revised Manuscript with Track Changes'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>An unmarked version of your revised paper without tracked changes. You should upload this as a separate file labeled 'Manuscript'.</p></list-item></list></p>
      <p>If you would like to make changes to your financial disclosure, please include your updated statement in your cover letter. Guidelines for resubmitting your figure files are available below the reviewer comments at the end of this letter.</p>
      <p>If applicable, we recommend that you deposit your laboratory protocols in protocols.io to enhance the reproducibility of your results. Protocols.io assigns your protocol its own identifier (DOI) so that it can be cited independently in the future. For instructions see: <ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-laboratory-protocols" ext-link-type="uri">https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-laboratory-protocols</ext-link>. Additionally, PLOS ONE offers an option for publishing peer-reviewed Lab Protocol articles, which describe protocols hosted on protocols.io. Read more information on sharing protocols at <ext-link xlink:href="https://plos.org/protocols?utm_medium=editorial-email&amp;utm_source=authorletters&amp;utm_campaign=protocols" ext-link-type="uri">https://plos.org/protocols?utm_medium=editorial-email&amp;utm_source=authorletters&amp;utm_campaign=protocols</ext-link>.</p>
      <p>We look forward to receiving your revised manuscript.</p>
      <p>Kind regards,</p>

      <p>Reviewer #1:&#xA0;1. Non-dysplastic BE does not need eradication treatment based on cost-effects ratio. The authors suggest a different opinion refering to referance 37, however, the article can not be searched. A article written by Prateek Sharma,et al. &lt;dysplasia a="" and="" barrett="" cancer="" cohort="" in="" large="" multicenter="" of="" patients="" with=""&gt;, seems the article the authors referred, according to the observation from Prateek Sharma, there was only 18 patients of 1376 objectives had at least 2 initial consecutive endoscopies with biopsies revealing non-dysplastc mucosa. And the inaccuracy operation of endoscopic biopsy making an imoact on the result should be considered, then, this is not strong evident supporting authors opinion. It is better for the authors to review more publishes correctly.</p>
      <p>2. Endoscopic surveillace is a effective method to detect early carcinoma also as a uesful management for patients who accepted endoscopic eradication therapy or other treatment. But, It should not be compared with other complete eradication treatment.</p>
      <p>3. For now, The best treatment for BE should based on the grade of dysplasia and the widths and depths of the lesion. For example, Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) is a widely used technique for diagnosing and</p>
      <p>eradicating superficial BE dysplasia and neoplasia, Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) can be employed to eradicate circumferential areas of dysplastic BE.</p>
      <p>4.Photodynamic Therapy is usually applied to esophageal cancer treatment. For BE, it is a option, but not commonly accepted.</p>
      <p>5. The authors research seems a little contributions for BE treatment reseach. Obsolete publishes included might be a reason.&lt;/dysplasia&gt;</p>
      <p>Reviewer #2:&#xA0;The author analyzed the advantages and disadvantages of different treatment methods for Barrett's esophagus using a net META method. The literature included in the study was all RCT studies, with small differences in sample size and high reliability in each study. Preliminary analysis has been conducted on the advantages of current methods for treating Barrett's esophagus. However, there are still some shortcomings in this article. In the discussion section, the current Barrett's esophageal treatment guidelines were not combined to point out the similarities and differences between your research and the guidelines.</p>
      <p>Reviewer #3:&#xA0;This meta-analysis deals with a very important topic, the treatment of Barrett's esophagus. The authors compare existing treatment options in order to evaluate them on the basis of available RCTs.</p>
      <p>The present manuscript still needs some fine-tuning in a few points:</p>
      <p>Minor remarks:</p>
      <p>1. Please insert a space before the brackets when introducing an abbreviation.</p>
      <p>2. In the methods section "study selection", please define what you consider as a small sample size.</p>
      <p>3. Statistical analysis: Here you write that it was investigated to what extent a small-sized trial influenced the results. However, in the study selection section small sized trials were excluded, please explain the discrepancy between these two points.</p>
      <p>4. Table 1: It would be nice, if you could explain in the legend, what is meant by wrong outcome, as this term is slightly misleading.</p>
      <p>5. MPEC is not introduced in the text.</p>
      <p>6. For figure 2: Please consider indicating, which of the 23 studies you have considered as potentially biased.</p>
      <p>7. It is slightly irritating, that Fig. 4A and 5A are mentioned way earlier in the text then the following numbers.</p>
      <p>8. Figure legend 2 needs a little more information what is to see in the figure.</p>
      <p>9. Reference in text to supplement figure 2 is missing.</p>
      <p>10. Also discuss newer developments like Hybrid-APC:</p>
      <p>Shimizu, T., Samarasena, J. B., Fortinsky, K. J., Hashimoto, R., Chehade, N. E. H., Chin, M. A., ... &amp; Chang, K. J. (2021).

The American journal of gastroenterology, 117(1), 110-119.</p>
      <p>11. In your overall conclusion I am missing a statement regarding surgery as a therapeutic option.</p>
      <p>Reviewer #4:&#xA0;This appears to be an article that could serve as an excellent guideline for the treatment of Barrett's esophagus (BE). However, there are a few points of curiosity that I would like to address:</p>
      <p>1. In the "study selection", the article divided the treatments into 10 major groups. I wonder if it could have been possible to group similar treatments together to create fewer groups.</p>
      <p>2. In the "study selection", it was mentioned that studies with small sample sizes were excluded. It would be helpful to specify the criteria used to determine what is considered a small sample size.</p>
      <p>3. While there seems to be a fundamental difference in the meaning of "complete ablation of BE" and "complete eradication of dysplasia," in practical terms, they appear to have very similar criteria. It would be beneficial to mention the rationale for separating these two, as they seem quite similar in clinical application.</p>
      <p>4. In Figure 1, the number of cases classified as "irrelevant" is quite high (805 cases). It would be helpful if the specific criteria used to make this determination were explicitly stated.</p>
      <p>5. Generally, dysplasia and esophageal adenocarcinoma are assessed using different criteria. If the article refers to "complete ablation of BE" and places adenocarcinoma on the same level as dysplasia, it would be useful to explain the reasoning behind this.</p>
      <p>6. If the article suggests that adenocarcinoma can progress directly from metaplasia without going through dysplasia, it might be more helpful to mention this in the introduction or study design section rather than just in the discussion. This could help reduce confusion.</p>
      <p>7. If the above-mentioned points of concern are addressed, this article has the potential to be clinically very helpful.</p>

      <p>Reviewer #1:</p>
      <p>1. Non-dysplastic BE does not need eradication treatment based on cost-effects ratio. The authors suggest a different opinion refering to referance 37, however, the article can not be searched. A article written by Prateek Sharma,et al. , seems the article the authors referred, according to the observation from Prateek Sharma, there was only 18 patients of 1376 objectives had at least 2 initial consecutive endoscopies with biopsies revealing non-dysplastc mucosa. And the inaccuracy operation of endoscopic biopsy making an impact on the result should be considered, then, this is not strong evident supporting authors opinion. It is better for the authors to review more publishes correctly.</p>
      <p>The author&#x2019;s answer: We are truly grateful for your professional review of our article. As per your request, Reference 37 can be accessed at the following address: <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/246664693_Progression_of_Barrett" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/246664693_Progression_of_Barrett</ext-link>'s_esophagus_to_high_grade_dysplasia_and_cancer_preliminary_results_of_the_BEST_Barrett's_Esophagus_Study_Trial Although the potential impact of inaccuracies in endoscopic biopsy operations on the results should be considered, it is undeniable that this extensive study suggests a need for caution regarding the rapid progression from intestinal metaplasia to invasive carcinoma.</p>
      <p>2. Endoscopic surveillace is a effective method to detect early carcinoma also as a uesful management for patients who accepted endoscopic eradication therapy or other treatment. But, It should not be compared with other complete eradication treatment.</p>
      <p>The author&#x2019;s answer: Thank you once more for your encouraging feedback and insightful suggestions on enhancing the quality of our manuscript. Regarding patients with non-dysplastic Barrett's esophagus, options such as endoscopic eradication or alternative treatments, along with regular endoscopic surveillance without additional intervention, are considered as potential treatment alternatives. Our aim in comparing these treatment options is to identify the most beneficial approach for the patients.</p>
      <p>3. For now, The best treatment for BE should based on the grade of dysplasia and the widths and depths of the lesion. For example, Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) is a widely used technique for diagnosing and eradicating superficial BE dysplasia and neoplasia, Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) can be employed to eradicate circumferential areas of dysplastic BE.</p>
      <p>The author&#x2019;s answer: I wholeheartedly agree with your opinion. However, as evidenced by the studies presented here, diverse treatment approaches are being employed for the management of patients with BE, perhaps indicative of the absence of a clear consensus. We aim to elucidate the relative priorities of these treatment options through rigorous scientific statistical methods.</p>
      <p>4. Photodynamic Therapy is usually applied to esophageal cancer treatment. For BE, it is a option, but not commonly accepted.</p>
      <p>The author&#x2019;s answer: Thank you for your feedback. We aim to use our research to identify and advocate for treatments that are more effective than others and promote their widespread use.</p>
      <p>5. The authors research seems a little contributions for BE treatment reseach. Obsolete publishes included might be a reason.</p>
      <p>The author&#x2019;s answer: We appreciate your constructive feedback. We will make the required revisions to our manuscript to ensure the credibility of our findings.</p>
      <p>Reviewer #2:</p>
      <p>The author analyzed the advantages and disadvantages of different treatment methods for Barrett's esophagus using a net META method. The literature included in the study was all RCT studies, with small differences in sample size and high reliability in each study. Preliminary analysis has been conducted on the advantages of current methods for treating Barrett's esophagus. However, there are still some shortcomings in this article.

Your comments have been immensely valuable and have greatly aided in enhancing the quality of our work. In response to your feedback, we have made substantial modifications to our manuscript to bolster the credibility of our results. In this revised version, all changes have been clearly highlighted in red within the document. We are truly grateful for your positive feedback and invaluable suggestions, which have undoubtedly contributed to the overall improvement of our manuscript.</p>
      <p>Reviewer #3:</p>
      <p>1. Please insert a space before the brackets when introducing an abbreviation.</p>
      <p>The author&#x2019;s answer: We would like to express our gratitude for the time you've invested and for granting us the opportunity to enhance the manuscript. We have addressed the formatting issues in the article.</p>
      <p>2. In the methods section "study selection", please define what you consider as a small sample size.</p>
      <p>The author&#x2019;s answer: We define small sample size studies as those with less than 20.</p>
      <p>3. Statistical analysis: Here you write that it was investigated to what extent a small-sized trial influenced the results. However, in the study selection section small sized trials were excluded, please explain the discrepancy between these two points.</p>
      <p>The author&#x2019;s answer: To ensure the quality of the included Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs), we excluded studies with small sample sizes below 20. Additionally, we constructed comparison-adjusted funnel plots and checked for symmetry to evaluate whether studies with smaller sample sizes among those included in the article influenced efficacy results.</p>
      <p>4. Table 1: It would be nice, if you could explain in the legend, what is meant by wrong outcome, as this term is slightly misleading.</p>
      <p>The author&#x2019;s answer: Due to the variety of techniques and treatment regimens employed for Barrett's esophagus, we categorized all treatments into 10 major groups based on the selected studies, as detailed in Table 1.</p>
      <p>5. MPEC is not introduced in the text.</p>
      <p>The author&#x2019;s answer: Thank you for your suggestion. We have included an introduction to MPEC in the article and highlighted it in red.</p>
      <p>6. For figure 2: Please consider indicating, which of the 23 studies you have considered as potentially biased.</p>
      <p>The author&#x2019;s answer: Based on your valuable suggestions, we have incorporated six studies with a high risk of bias into the quality assessment section of the article and highlighted them using red font. Studies with four or more high-risk domains were deemed to possess an overall high risk of bias.</p>
      <p>7. It is slightly irritating, that Fig. 4A and 5A are mentioned way earlier in the text then the following numbers.</p>
      <p>The author&#x2019;s answer: Thank you for your comments, which are greatly appreciated. I'd like to clarify that in our effort to systematically compare the effectiveness of various treatment options, we have established four different outcome indicators. To enhance readability for our readers, we have standardized the serial numbers of the associated pictures for each outcome indicator.</p>
      <p>8. Figure legend 2 needs a little more information what is to see in the figure.</p>
      <p>The author&#x2019;s answer: Thank you for your comment, which we have supplemented in the manuscript.</p>
      <p>9. Reference in text to supplement figure 2 is missing.</p>
      <p>The author&#x2019;s answer: We sincerely thank you for your valuable feedback that we have used to improve the quality of our manuscript.</p>
      <p>10. Also discuss newer developments like Hybrid-APC:</p>
      <p>Shimizu, T., Samarasena, J. B., Fortinsky, K. J., Hashimoto, R., Chehade, N. E. H., Chin, M. A., ... &amp; Chang, K. J. (2021). Benefit, tolerance, and safety of hybrid argon plasma coagulation for treatment of Barrett's esophagus: US pilot study. Endoscopy International Open, 9(12), E1870-E1876.</p>
      <p>Knabe, M., Beyna, T., R&#xF6;sch, T., Bergman, J., Manner, H., May, A., ... &amp; Ehlken, H. (2022). Hybrid APC in Combination With Resection for the Endoscopic Treatment of Neoplastic Barrett's Esophagus: A Prospective, Multicenter Study. The American journal of gastroenterology, 117(1), 110-119.</p>
      <p>The author&#x2019;s answer: Limited attention had been given to Hybrid-APC. The research progress of Hybrid-APC has now been incorporated into the discussion section of the article.</p>
      <p>11. In your overall conclusion I am missing a statement regarding surgery as a therapeutic option.</p>
      <p>The author&#x2019;s answer: Thank you for your suggestion. Given that only one of the studies we analyzed involved surgery as an intervention, we approached making comparisons between surgery and other treatment options in the Discussion section with caution. It is undeniable that endoscopic treatments maintain the normal esophageal anatomy, are safer, and are linked to lower morbidity and mortality rates compared to esophagectomy. For these reasons, endoscopic interventions are increasingly becoming the primary therapy for patients with high-grade dysplasia (HGD) or intramucosal cancer, replacing surgery.</p>
      <p>Reviewer #4:</p>
      <p>1. In the "study selection", the article divided the treatments into 10 major groups. I wonder if it could have been possible to group similar treatments together to create fewer groups.</p>
      <p>The author&#x2019;s answer: Thank you for your valuable feedback, which is greatly appreciated. Prior to this, we had made attempts to categorize similar interventions, such as grouping proton pump inhibitors and H2 receptor antagonists together. Further consolidation could potentially impact the accuracy of the research findings.</p>
      <p>2. In the "study selection", it was mentioned that studies with small sample sizes were excluded. It would be helpful to specify the criteria used to determine what is considered a small sample size.</p>
      <p>The author&#x2019;s answer: Thanks for your suggestion, we define small sample size studies as those with less than 20. We have added it in the article and marked it in red.</p>
      <p>3. While there seems to be a fundamental difference in the meaning of "complete ablation of BE" and "complete eradication of dysplasia," in practical terms, they appear to have very similar criteria. It would be beneficial to mention the rationale for separating these two, as they seem quite similar in clinical application.</p>
      <p>The author&#x2019;s answer: Thanks for your suggestion, we have added it to Study Selection of the article and marked it in red.</p>
      <p>4. In Figure 1, the number of cases classified as "irrelevant" is quite high (805 cases). It would be helpful if the specific criteria used to make this determination were explicitly stated.</p>
      <p>The author&#x2019;s answer: Thank you for your comment. We define irrelevant studies as those that are not related to the treatment of Barrett's esophagus.</p>
      <p>5. Generally, dysplasia and esophageal adenocarcinoma are assessed using different criteria. If the article refers to "complete ablation of BE" and places adenocarcinoma on the same level as dysplasia, it would be useful to explain the reasoning behind this.</p>
      <p>The author&#x2019;s answer: When it comes to the complete ablation of Barrett's esophagus, we combined adenocarcinoma and dysplasia into a single group for statistical analysis, given the limited number of studies and the small sample size specifically related to adenocarcinoma.</p>
      <p>6. If the article suggests that adenocarcinoma can progress directly from metaplasia without going through dysplasia, it might be more helpful to mention this in the introduction or study design section rather than just in the discussion. This could help reduce confusion.</p>
      <p>The author&#x2019;s answer: We would like to express our gratitude for your time and the valuable opportunity you have provided us to enhance the manuscript. Our study has indicated that depending solely on endoscopic surveillance or PPI/H2RA treatment alone might not be sufficient for managing BE. This conclusion is supported by the research of SHARMA P et al., who noted that a subset of patients with intestinal metaplasia could progress rapidly to invasive carcinoma without the usual progression through dysplasia. These insights have been integrated into the discussion section of the article.</p>

      <p>Reviewer #1:&#xA0;Barrett's esophagus (BE) is a precancerous condition which can develop into esophageal cancer (EC) without correct management. For now, the standard surveillance for BE is endoscopy regularly based on the grade dysplasia of BE in order to detect early carcinoma. The widely accepted treatment to BE is endoscopic eradication therapy,including APC, EMR and ESD. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is another option eradication of BE. Photodynamic therapy (PDT)is a rare chioce for BE. However, considering the high preveilence of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma,PDT was frequently used in China for some time past, and the Chinese researchers have more experiences in PDT. I think we can give the authors a chance to provide a different view for management of BE although their manuscript based on uncommon strategy for BE.</p>
      <p>Reviewer #3:&#xA0;Thanks for including MPEC in the treatment groups, but you forgot to also included it in the abbreviations section.</p>
