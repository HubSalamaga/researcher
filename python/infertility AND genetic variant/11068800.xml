      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p id="Par3">The development of germ cells and their differentiation into gametes is crucial for the faithful transmission of both genetic and epigenetic information to the next generation. Primordial germ cells (PGCs) are the first germ cells to emerge in the post-implantation embryo. In mice, as few as 3&#x2212;5 founder PGCs are specified at E6.0-6.5 and these undergo extensive proliferation, increasing to around 20,000 by E12.5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. To develop into functional gametes, PGCs must undergo a unique developmental program, repressing somatic genes and activating pluripotency and germ-cell-specific factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. This entails extensive epigenetic reprogramming resulting in altered histone modifications and DNA demethylation which facilitates the erasure of genomic imprints, and reactivation of the inactive X-chromosome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. DNA demethylation has been proposed to occur by multiple mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. A prevalent model describes a two-step process involving a passive demethylation phase in which DNA methylation is diluted by DNA replication (&#x2018;reprogramming step 1&#x2019;) followed by active, enzymatic DNA demethylation that occurs upon colonization of the embryonic gonads (&#x2018;reprogramming step 2&#x2019;)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Thus, PGC development is highly dependent on DNA replication, both for lineage expansion and for epigenetic reprogramming.</p>
      <p id="Par4">The replication of DNA can be hindered by various obstacles, such as chemical damage to the DNA molecule or DNA secondary structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. The failure to resolve these impediments can have catastrophic consequences for a cell. Incomplete or under-replication of the genome can block cell cycle progression, either directly or by activation of the DNA damage response (DDR) including cell cycle checkpoints<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. If this persists the cell may ultimately die. To combat these challenges, eukaryotes have evolved both DNA repair as well DNA damage tolerance (DDT) mechanisms. One route of DDT is error-prone translesion synthesis (TLS). TLS allows DNA replication to continue past impediments and facilitates the filling of gaps which remain at the end of S-phase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. TLS utilizes specialized polymerases with active sites that can accommodate damaged or distorted DNA templates and which lack proofreading activity, hence increasing the risk of DNA mutagenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. In the germ cell compartment, ensuring that replication can proceed is of paramount importance to allow sufficient cellular expansion to guard against sterility. However, any increase in the mutagenicity of replication increases the risk of deleterious phenotypes and inherited disease in future generations.</p>
      <p id="Par5">Recent genome wide association studies (GWAS) have implicated multiple DDR pathways as determinants of infertility in humans, however little is known about the underlying mechanism or if this requirement extends to the TLS pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. In this study, we find that TLS plays a crucial role in the development of embryonic germ cells in both humans and mice. Our results show that factors involved in sequential stages of TLS are essential for PGC development. In the absence of TLS, PGCs are specified in normal numbers but fail to expand, resulting in a&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;150-fold reduction. In contrast to the severe effect on the germline, somatic tissues of these mutants are unperturbed in their development with no discernible impact on homeostasis or survival. Consistent with a defect in TLS, mutant PGCs show reduced proliferation, accumulation at the G2/M phase of the cell cycle and increased markers of unresolved DNA damage. In addition, the loss of TLS prevents progression of the germ cell transcriptional program and results in failure of genome-wide DNA demethylation, an essential and conserved step in the development of mammalian embryonic germ cells. Our findings define a critical role of TLS specifically in germ cell development, safeguarding fertility and enabling successful PGC epigenetic reprogramming.</p>

        <title>REV1 is required for PGC development in human and mouse</title>
        <p id="Par6">GWAS studies focused on infertility have revealed genes important for human germline development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Notably, factors that deal with DNA damage are frequent hits. In agreement with these findings, the DDR has been implicated in germ cell production and maintenance. Loss of several DDR factors results in infertility due to failure during meiosis, likely as a result of the inability to resolve meiotic DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) and recombination intermediates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. However, it has been found that DDR pathways and factors including Fanconi Anemia crosslink repair, base excision repair and homologous recombination amongst others are also required for the embryonic development of germ cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. One of these factors, REV7, is involved in multiple DNA repair transactions including the repair of DNA DSBs, mitotic progression, and TLS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Due to the requirement of various replication-coupled repair pathways in the embryonic germline, we set out to test if the TLS pathway is required for fertility. TLS is important for the completion of DNA replication, and we therefore hypothesized that it may play a role in ensuring successful genome duplication during highly proliferative stages of gametogenesis. As early embryonic germ cell development is particularly proliferative, we asked if TLS is required during primordial germ cell (PGC) development. We employed an in vitro model in which iPSCs are differentiated into human PGC-like cells (hPGCLCs) (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. To study the potential roles of TLS in human germ cell development we focused on REV1, a core component of the TLS pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. REV1 was disrupted in human BTAG iPSCs carrying both the BLIMP1-tdTomato and TFAP2C-EGFP PGCLC reporters (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. Clones with successful disruption of REV1 were identified by PCR then validated by testing for hypersensitivity to mitomycin C (MMC) (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1b, c</xref>). We first assessed if the loss of REV1 affected iPSC function. As REV1 plays a role in DNA replication we assessed proliferation of mutant iPSCs and found no difference between <italic>REV1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> and the parental line (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1d</xref>). We also assessed the ability of <italic>REV1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> iPSCs to differentiate into different lineages by measuring embryoid body formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. We found that REV1 lines were able to differentiate into all three germ layers similarly to the parental wildtype line (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1e</xref>). In contrast, we found that three independent <italic>REV1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> lines had a significant reduction in the ability to induce hPGCLCs, consistent with a role in embryonic germ cell development (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b, c</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1f</xref>). While the frequency of hPGCLCs generated was significantly reduced in the absence of REV1, the few induced hPGCLCs expressed the canonical germ cell markers SOX17, TFAP2C and OCT4 (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). The magnified inset shows the nuclear localization of each factor (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>REV1-deficiency leads to defects in hPGCLC induction and infertility in mice.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Schematic of the hPGCLC differentiation protocol adapted from<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. <bold>b</bold> Representative flow cytometry plots and (<bold>c</bold>) quantification of hPGCLC frequency at day 4 from three independent wildtype or <italic>REV1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> clones differentiated three times.

        <p id="Par7">Due to limitations of studying human gametogenesis in vivo, we asked if the requirement for TLS factors in PGC development was conserved to mice, thus facilitating mechanistic studies. REV1-deficient mice were crossed with wildtype mates to assess fertility. Consistent with our observations in human, we found that neither male nor female <italic>Rev1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice gave rise to offspring despite evidence of copulation (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. Upon analysis of the gonads, we observed a striking reduction in testis mass but the mass of the ovaries was unaffected (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f, g</xref>). Histological analysis of the testes revealed a majority (96.8%) of Sertoli-cell-only (SCO) seminiferous tubules and an absence of promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF)<sup>+</sup> cells, which marks undifferentiated spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs, Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1h, i</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1g</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. In females, we observed no follicles upon histological examination of <italic>Rev1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> ovaries, suggesting a complete failure of oogenesis (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1h, j</xref>). Together, these data reveal a lack of gametes in both <italic>Rev1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> male and female mice. The lack of visible PLZF<sup>+</sup> cells in male gonads and meiotic cells in either sex argues that the defect is pre-meiotic which is consistent with the hPGCLC data suggesting a failure in germ cell development during embryonic stages. Therefore, we studied the development of embryonic germ cells using the GOF18-GFP PGC reporter in which GFP expression is driven by a fragment of the <italic>Oct4</italic> promoter (<italic>Oct4&#x394;PE</italic>) (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1k</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>.

        <title>The requirement for the C-terminal domain of REV1 and the Pol&#x3B6; subunit REV7 links TLS to PGC development</title>

This region of REV1 plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular resistance to DNA damage that impedes replication indicating that the C-terminus is the key region of REV1 for TLS transactions.

        <title>The post-translational modification of PCNA preserves PGC development</title>

As our results found a requirement for the TLS factors REV1 and REV7, we wanted to study if there is also a role for PCNA K164 modification during PGC development.

        <p id="Par14">Having observed an essential requirement for TLS factors in mammalian germ cell development, we wondered if this was unique to the germline. In agreement with a previous report, we found a 2.6-fold reduction in the frequency of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in adult <italic>Pcna</italic><sup><italic>R/R</italic></sup>&#xA0;mice (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5a, b</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref></sup>.

However, there was no change in the frequency of peripheral red blood cells or hemoglobin concentration (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5d, e</xref>). As adult HSCs are largely quiescent we hypothesized that the defect may begin during embryonic development when HSPCs are highly proliferative<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref></sup>. Similar to adult mice, we found that E12.5 <italic>Pcna</italic><sup><italic>R/R</italic></sup> embryos had a 1.73-fold reduction in the frequency of HSPCs, revealing that the blood stem cell defect begins during embryonic development (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5f</xref>). Despite a numerical HSPC defect and evidence of genomic instability, we found that blood compartment homeostasis was remarkably intact with adult <italic>Pcna</italic><sup><italic>R/R</italic></sup> mice showing comparable bone marrow cellularity to littermates, normal blood cell maturation, and sustained peripheral blood homeostasis (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5g&#x2212;l</xref>).</p>

As PCNA is an essential component of the replication machinery, and its modification at K164 directly couples DDT to the replisome, we assessed the proportion of actively dividing cells in highly mitotic tissues.

Consistent with the histological analysis, we observe loss of tissue function in mutants leading to disruption of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. This led to systemic hormonal dysregulation with elevated levels of luteinising hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) driving reactive stromal hyperplasia and a significant increase in testicular interstitial cells and ovarian stroma. As animals age, persistent hypergonadotrophism leads to a substantial increase in ovarian mass with mutant ovaries of 12-month-old mice being 3 times larger than wildtype controls (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7d</xref>). These features are consistent across TLS-deficient mice with similar defects seen in <italic>Rev1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> and <italic>Rev7</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> adults (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>).</p>
        <p id="Par16">Overall, whilst the PCNA K164R mutation results in increased sensitivity to exogenous DNA damage and a reduction in HSPCs, our findings reveal that the development and homeostasis of somatic tissues are largely unaffected.

As TLS mitigates replication blocks, we asked if <italic>Pcna</italic><sup><italic>R/R</italic></sup> or <italic>Rev1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> PGCs accumulate unresolved DNA damage. We stained PGCs for the phosphorylation of histone variant H2A.X (&#x263;-H2A.X), a marker of DNA DSBs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref></sup>. A greater proportion of TLS-deficient PGCs had &gt;10 &#x263;-H2A.X foci compared to wildtype (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). Consistent with our previous data this finding was specific to PGCs as an increase was not observed in the surrounding somatic tissue (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8a</xref>). To build on this, we stained for the presence of RPA foci, which binds to single stranded DNA generated during repair transactions or when DNA replication is perturbed and leads to under-replicated regions in the genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref></sup>.

        <p id="Par18">Altered proliferation and apoptosis are frequent cellular responses to persistent DNA damage. The failure of the PGC pool to expand between E8.5-E12.5 in TLS-deficient embryos could be explained by either reduced PGC proliferation, increased PGC death, or a combination of both. We therefore first asked if TLS-deficiency leads to increased PGC death by staining E12.5 urogenital ridges for the apoptotic marker cleaved-caspase 3 (CC3)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref></sup>. We observed significant 7.7-fold and 5.1-fold increases in the proportion of apoptotic (CC3<sup>+</sup>) PGCs in <italic>Pcna</italic><sup><italic>R/R</italic></sup> and <italic>Rev1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> embryos respectively (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>). In contrast, there was no significant increase in the proportion of CC3<sup>+</sup> somatic cells in either mutant (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8b</xref>). We next assessed in vivo PGC proliferation by injecting pregnant dams with a single dose of ethynyl-2&#x2019;-deoxyuridine (EdU), which is incorporated into the DNA of replicating cells allowing the quantification of the proportion of cells in S-phase during the EdU pulse (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8c</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref></sup>.

In the soma however, we observed a comparable number of EdU<sup>+</sup> somatic cells in mutant and wildtype embryos, suggesting that the reduced proliferation is restricted to the germ cell compartment (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8d</xref>). To assess if reduced incorporation of EdU may be due to defects in cell cycle kinetics, we assessed the cell cycle properties of PGCs. First, we stained cells for Ser-10 phosphorylation of histone H3 (pH3) that occurs during cell division facilitating chromatin compaction, necessary for mitosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref></sup>. We found that a higher proportion of PGCs stained positive for pH3 in <italic>Pcna</italic><sup><italic>R/R</italic></sup> and <italic>Rev1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> genital ridges (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4f</xref>).

At E12.5 15.7% of wildtype PGCs had nuclear cyclin B1 and were therefore in G2/M-phase (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8e</xref>). This was significantly higher in the absence of TLS with a 2.6-fold increase in G2/M-phase PGCs in <italic>Pcna</italic><sup><italic>R/R</italic></sup> gonads (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8e</xref>).

        <p id="Par20">The expression of germ cell specific genes in PGCs is activated during epigenetic reprogramming, specifically through DNA demethylation of gene promoters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref></sup>. The process of DNA demethylation occurs across the whole genome and is unique to the PGC compartment in the embryo. Alongside gene expression regulation, DNA demethylation is critical for imprint erasure and X-chromosome reactivation, processes needed for germ cell function. Our gene expression data prompted us to assess DNA methylation of PGCs. We performed whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) on wildtype and <italic>Pcna</italic><sup><italic>R/R</italic></sup> FACS-purified E12.5 PGCs and compared these to wildtype E6.5 epiblast cells, which are the origin of PGCs (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>). Compared to epiblast cells, the genome of wildtype E12.5 PGCs had extremely low levels of DNA CpG methylation, reflecting demethylation during PGC development. In contrast, in <italic>Pcna</italic><sup><italic>R/R</italic></sup> PGCs we found a near complete retention of DNA CpG methylation (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>). We mapped the methylation levels across the genome and found the retention in <italic>Pcna</italic><sup><italic>R/R</italic></sup> PGCs was genome-wide (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>).</p>
        <p id="Par21">DNA methylation does not proceed uniformly, with different genomic features reaching the lowest level of methylation at different times<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref></sup>. We therefore asked if only a subset of genomic features retained DNA methylation in TLS mutants or if the defect was truly global. Analysis of gene bodies and promoters showed that these were hypermethylated in <italic>Pcna</italic><sup><italic>R/R</italic></sup> PGCs compared to wildtype, suggesting a failure in the early, global phase of demethylation (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e, f</xref>). We also found that repeat elements (LINE-1, SINE elements, and endogenous retroviruses) retained methylation in <italic>Pcna</italic><sup><italic>R/R</italic></sup> PGCs (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5f</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9a</xref>). We validated this result by locus-specific, targeted bisulfite DNA sequencing of LINE-1 as it makes up ~20% of the genome and again found increased methylation in both <italic>Pcna</italic><sup><italic>R/R</italic></sup> and <italic>Rev1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> PGCs (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5g</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10a&#x2212;d</xref>). We went on to analyze features which undergo DNA demethylation in the later wave and for which demethylation is both characteristic of germ cell development but also required for function. We found that imprinted differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were hypermethylated in E12.5 <italic>Pcna</italic><sup><italic>R/R</italic></sup> PGCs, including both maternally and paternally methylated DMRs (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9b</xref>). Thus, this analysis reveals that the later wave of DNA demethylation also fails in the absence of TLS.</p>
        <p id="Par22">CGIs (CpG islands) in the promoters of genes associated with germ cell specific processes have been shown to retain DNA methylation until E11.5 and be demethylated in the later wave of PGC DNA demethylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. These genes are involved in meiosis and gamete generation and are only expressed in germ cells but silenced and methylated in somatic cells. We found that these promoters were hypermethylated in mutant PGCs (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9c</xref>). We next analyzed CpG methylation of genes required for germ cell production whose transcriptional activation is concurrent with promoter demethylation during the later stages of PGC development (germline reprogramming responsive genes - GRR genes)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref></sup>. CpG methylation analysis of a panel of 45 GRRs showed that these were largely demethylated in E12.5 wildtype PGCs (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5h</xref>). In <italic>Pcna</italic><sup><italic>R/R</italic></sup> E12.5 PGCs however, these were hypermethylated. We confirmed this by performing locus-specific BS-Seq of the promoters of two GRR genes <italic>Mili</italic> and <italic>Dazl</italic> (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10e, f</xref>). It is striking that we observed both reduced expression of the GRR genes <italic>Mvh</italic>, <italic>Dazl</italic>, <italic>Mili</italic>, <italic>Mael, Sycp3, Mov10l1, Hormad1</italic> and <italic>Brdt</italic> and also hypermethylation of these loci in <italic>Pcna</italic><sup><italic>R/R</italic></sup> PGCs (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>, <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">i</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9d</xref>). This retention of DNA methylation in TLS mutants may explain the reduced activation of GRRs</p>
        <p id="Par23">We compared the levels of DNA CpG methylation in mutant and wildtype E12.5 PGCs to the E6.5 epiblast. The retention of methylation across a panel of genomic features revealed that E12.5 <italic>Pcna</italic><sup><italic>R/R</italic></sup> PGCs were more akin to the epiblast than to wildtype PGCs (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e&#x2212;g</xref>). Together, these data show that loss of TLS prevents global DNA demethylation in PGCs with retention occurring at early and late demethylated regions. Furthermore, E12.5 mutant PGCs appear trapped at an earlier stage of development with a methylome similar to E6.5 epiblast cells.</p>
        <p id="Par24">Next, we focused on understanding the basis for methylation retention in the absence of TLS and its effect on expression of germline genes. First, we studied the machinery that normally adds methylation marks to DNA by either ensuring methylation patterns are inherited during cell division or by depositing new methylation marks. Following DNA replication, the newly synthesized DNA strand is unmethylated and DNMT1 is recruited to hemimethylated CpG dyads and transfers a methyl group to the unmethylated cytosine whilst DNMT3A and DNMT3B adds methylation marks to unmethylated DNA to deposit de novo methylation. We measured the expression of <italic>Dnmt1</italic>, <italic>Dnmt3a</italic> and <italic>Dnmt3b</italic> and found no difference between wildtype and <italic>Pcna</italic><sup><italic>R/R</italic></sup> E12.5 PGCs suggesting that overexpression of the methyltransferases is not responsible for DNA hypermethylation in the absence of TLS (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5j</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9e</xref>). The enzyme TET1 has been shown to play important DNA demethylation dependent and independent roles in regulating the expression of genes critical for gamete formation. Notably, TET1 has previously been shown necessary for the transcriptional activation and maintenance of low levels of methylation at GRRs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref></sup>. We quantified the expression of <italic>Tet1</italic> and its family member <italic>Tet2</italic> in wildtype and <italic>Pcna</italic><sup><italic>R/R</italic></sup> E12.5 PGCs and found no difference indicating that failure to activate the GRR genes is not mediated through <italic>Tet1</italic> expression (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5j</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9f</xref>). We further validated this through TET1 immunostaining in E12.5 urogenital ridges which revealed the presence of protein in wildtype and <italic>Pcna</italic><sup><italic>R/R</italic></sup> E12.5 PGCs (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9g</xref>).</p>
        <p id="Par25">Together, these data reveal that E12.5 TLS-deficient PGCs resemble earlier stages of germ cell development transcriptionally and in their methylome. As DNA methylation regulates gene expression it is plausible that the retention observed in TLS mutants may contribute to the observed reduction in expression of germ cell genes. As well as failure of GRR demethylation, mutant PGCs also fail to erase imprinted DMR methylation, processes essential for normal germ cell function.</p>

      <p id="Par26">Declining birth rates and increasing infertility are drawing attention to environmental and genetic causes of human infertility. GWAS studies have identified the DDR as an important regulator of this, however mechanistic studies have for the most part been lacking. Our current work reveals a crucial role for DNA translesion synthesis during germline development. Our findings demonstrate that REV1 is required for both human PGCLC and mouse PGC development, indicating a conserved embryonic cause of infertility.</p>
      <p id="Par27">Alongside REV1, we show that REV7 and the modification site of PCNA, K164, are essential for embryonic germ cell development. Though all three of these factors can act in multiple different processes, our results assert that it is their common role in TLS that is required<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. REV1 has both catalytic and non-catalytic functions and we have found that the C-terminal protein interaction domain, critical for TLS, is required in PGCs. Like REV1, the monoubiquitination of PCNA at K164 serves as a TLS scaffold. REV7 interacts with REV3L to form the TLS extender polymerase called Pol&#x3B6; which has a specialized function in catalyzing DNA synthesis after lesion bypass during TLS. Importantly, Pol&#x3B6; is recruited to TLS sites through direct interactions between its REV7 subunit and REV1&#x2019;s C-terminal domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. Our finding that both the REV1 C-terminus and REV7 are essential in PGCs supports a role for both in TLS. Our results did not identify an inserter TLS polymerase which may be explained by the well-characterized redundancy between the inserter polymerases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. We found that the three core TLS factors REV1, REV7 and PCNA K164 are required during embryonic stages of germ cell development and have identical timing and magnitude of PGC defects. In addition, the remaining PGCs in <italic>Rev1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> and <italic>Pcna</italic><sup><italic>R/R</italic></sup> embryos are phenotypically indistinguishable. This striking phenotypic overlap suggests that the cause of defect is the same in all three mutants with TLS being the only function common to all three factors. Whilst REV7 has described functions in DNA DSB repair and mitosis our data suggest that it is the role of REV7 in Pol&#x3B6; that is required for normal PGC development. Together, these data argue that TLS plays an essential role in fertility by preserving the development of PGCs.</p>
      <p id="Par28">DNA repair pathways such as Fanconi anemia (FA) DNA crosslink repair and DNA DSB repair, have previously been shown to be necessary for PGC development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> (23, 25, 70&#x2212;72). It is interesting that both genetic and biochemical studies have shown that the TLS factors REV1 and Pol&#x3B6; (REV7-REV3L) act in a common pathway with the FA repair proteins to maintain cellular resistance to DNA interstrand crosslinking agents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref></sup>. Indeed we found that <italic>Pcna</italic><sup><italic>R/R</italic></sup><italic>, Rev1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup>
<italic>and Rev7</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> MEFs were mildly hypersensitive to DNA crosslinking agents, however this sensitivity was much less than in the absence of FANCA (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11a</xref>). This does however leave the possibility that the loss of PGCs in FA-deficient and TLS-deficient mice shares a common cause. However, the magnitude and the temporality of the defects are different between the two classes of mutants with the loss of PGCs in TLS-deficient mice occurring 48&#x2009;h before a loss of PGCs is observed in FA-mutants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. The magnitude of PGC loss in E12.5 TLS-deficient embryos is also two orders of magnitude greater than in the absence of the FA pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Furthermore, there are substantial phenotypic differences between TLS-deficient and FA-deficient PGCs - the loss of FA repair factors does not alter the expression of GRR genes nor block DNA demethylation unlike the loss of TLS components<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. This shows that whilst multiple DNA repair pathways are required for normal PGC development, they have distinct roles with different phenotypic outcomes.</p>
      <p id="Par29">The phenotypic features of the few remaining PGCs in TLS-deficient embryos explains the basis of germ cell loss and sterility. We found that mutant PGCs have a higher burden of DNA damage, apoptosis and cell cycle abnormalities as well as a failure in DNA demethylation and activation of the germ cell transcriptional program. Together these phenotypic features are likely to explain the basis of the failure of PGC development and infertility. Our results reveal that TLS is essential for the developmental processes that are needed for the production of mature germ cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="Par30">The increase in DNA damage markers, whilst not previously shown in a physiological context, are consistent with known consequences of TLS deficiency upon genotoxin exposure in tissue culture systems. We observe an increase in the frequency of TLS-deficient PGCs with &#x263;-H2A.X foci, RPA32 foci and CHK2 phosphorylation. Whilst none of these markers are entirely specific to the accumulation of DNA DSBs the combination of all three strongly suggests that in the absence of TLS PGCs accumulate DNA DSBs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref></sup>. We also observed that an increased proportion of TLS-deficient PGCs are pH3-positive and have nuclear cyclin B1 localization, and therefore are&#xA0;at the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, with a reduced number staining positive for EdU following a 4&#x2009;h pulse showing that fewer replicate their DNA and hence go through S-phase. These findings are consistent with a role for TLS either during S-phase (on-the-fly TLS) or in post-replicative repair. Whilst this data does not tell us when during the cell cycle DNA damage occurs it does suggest that it poses a block to mitosis following DNA synthesis unless it is resolved by TLS. It is interesting to note that embryonic stem cells have a less effective G1 checkpoint<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref></sup>. As this appears to also be the case in PGCs it would suggest that cells can enter into S-phase laden with DNA damage thus necessitating replication coupled repair such as TLS for resolution of damage and entry into mitosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref></sup>. Finally, we observed an increase in the proportion of TLS-deficient PGCs that undergo apoptosis which is a frequent cellular response to DNA damage. However, several studies have reported that loss of the DDR leads to a reduction in PGC number by altering the cell cycle rather than through apoptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref></sup>. This difference may be due to the different repair pathways in these studies counteracting distinct classes of DNA damage that, when unrepaired, result in different cellular outcomes. However, apoptosis does play a role in the clearance of PGCs during unperturbed development or when epigenetic regulators, that normally suppress transposons, are lost<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">104</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">106</xref></sup>. Taken together, our data shows that in the absence of TLS PGCs accumulate markers of DNA damage, induce cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase of the cell cycle and undergo apoptosis. It is likely that a combination of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis ultimately results in the numerical PGC defect. Whilst these findings are consistent with the described role of TLS factors in dealing with DNA damage, the failure to undergo DNA demethylation or transcribe germ cell factors is entirely unexpected.</p>
      <p id="Par31">Whilst wildtype PGCs have very low levels of CpG methylation by E12.5, we found that TLS-deficient PGCs have genome-wide retention of DNA methylation. Indeed, we found that the methylation of TLS-deficient PGCs at E12.5 was similar to that seen in E6.5 epiblast cells. These data argue that the PGC precursors in the epiblast have undergone de novo methylation during early embryogenesis before later undergoing demethylation in PGC development. The observed cell cycle defects could explain why demethylation is prevented in the absence of TLS. Cell cycle arrested PGCs may be unable to respond to time-dependent cell extrinsic cues, such as signaling molecules that instruct PGCs to proceed in their development. Alternatively, the cell cycle perturbations may block a cell-intrinsic process, preventing activation of the germ cell program and epigenetic reprogramming. Interestingly, the first stage of global DNA demethylation in PGCs relies upon replication to dilute methylation marks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref></sup>. Therefore, the cell cycle arrest in TLS-deficient PGCs may result in the genome-wide retention of methylation marks that we observe. The normal expression of TET1 in mutant PGCs argues against dysregulation of either its enzymatic or non-enzymatic functions as a contributing factor to the phenotype observed.</p>
      <p id="Par32">Whilst early stage PGC genes are induced by extrinsic signals and maintained by PGC-specific and pluripotency-associated transcription factors, DNA demethylation is important for the transcription of genes expressed in the later stages of PGC development. Therefore, the failure to transcribe GRR genes and retention of DNA methylation may not be independent of each other. Indeed, we find reduced mRNA expression and DNA hypermethylation of each GRR gene that was analyzed. It is therefore likely that the block in cell cycle progression in the absence of TLS prevents DNA demethylation, transcription of germ cell factors and therefore blocks PGC development.</p>
      <p id="Par33">The specificity of the phenotype which only affects germ cell homeostasis is intriguing. Despite loss of genome stability in the erythroid lineage and a reduction in blood stem cell frequency that we show begins in utero, TLS-deficient mice sustain peripheral blood homeostasis throughout life. Moreover, in vivo assessment of rapidly dividing tissues in <italic>Pcna</italic><sup><italic>R/R</italic></sup> mice revealed no defects or overt phenotypes in somatic tissue homeostasis and consistent with this, mutant mice show normal longevity (Supplementary Figs.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). In contrast, there is a complete failure to generate functional gametes. This striking dichotomy raises the question of why TLS is only required to maintain homeostasis in the germ cell compartment. We have demonstrated that TLS is required for processes that occur only in the germ cell lineage: engagement of germline genes and genome-wide DNA demethylation. In addition, we find that the canonical phenotypes associated with TLS deficiency and the DNA damage response are also restricted to the germ cell compartment: unresolved DNA damage, apoptosis, and cell cycle perturbation (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref>). This raises the possibilities that (i) the DNA damage checkpoints that activate apoptosis or cell cycle arrest are different in PGCs than in somatic cells, (ii) there are replication impediments or other features unique to PGCs that confer a dependency on TLS activity or (iii) that PGCs are more reliant upon TLS to resolve replication impediments than somatic cell types.</p>
      <p id="Par34">Future work will be required to determine which of these possibilities explains the selective requirement for TLS during PGC development. Recent work has shown that PGCs frequently experience transcription-replication conflicts and it is plausible that TLS factors are required to overcome such sources of genome instability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">107</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">108</xref></sup>. Alternatively, the lack of a G1 cell cycle checkpoint in PGCs may render these cells uniquely dependent upon TLS to bypass damage during S-phase that in other cells would be repaired prior to the initiation of replication. Finally, it is tempting to speculate that the dependency of PGC development on TLS may be directly connected to early epigenetic reprogramming events that are required for subsequent germline development.</p>

When staining for SLAM markers the same lineage cocktail was used (FITC) with the addition of the following antibodies: anti-CD48 (FITC, clone HM48-1, BioLegend), anti-CD41 (FITC, clone MWReg30, BD Pharmigen), anti-CD150 (APC, clone TC15-12F12.2, BioLegend) and anti-c-Kit and Sca-1 as above. Maturation of B cells was assessed using anti-CD45R/B220 (PE, clone RA3-6B2, BD Pharmingen) and anti-IgM (APC, clone II/41, BD Pharmingen). The maturation of the erythroid lineage was analysed using antibodies anti-TER-119 (APC, clone Ter-119, BD Pharmingen) and anti-CD71 (PE, clone C2, BD Pharmingen). Granulocyte&#x2013;macrophage maturation was assessed with antibodies anti-CD11b/Mac-1 (APC, clone M1/70, BD Pharmingen) and anti-Ly-6G/Gr-1 (PE, clone RB6-8C5, eBioscience). Thymic T-cell maturation was assessed using CD4 (FITC, clone H129.19, BD Pharmingen) and CD8a (PE, clone 53-6.7, BD Pharmingen) antibodies. The samples were incubated for 15&#x2009;min at 4&#x2009;&#xB0;C in the dark with the exception of samples containing anti-CD34 (RAM34), which were incubated for 90&#x2009;min. Samples were run on a LSRII flow cytometer (BD Pharmingen) and the data were analysed with FlowJo v10.</p>
